  - problem: One company produced even sheet glass for flat monitors.
    Equipment for the glass strip production is designed in such a way that
    liquid glass flows by a flat flow along a special long guide (ISO-pipe)
    and hardens forming a glass strip.  The experiments showed the quality of
    the glass to be satisfactory according to all the parameters except the
    one - the glass surface appeared not to be even enough.
