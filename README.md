# Open Discovery

This project has the goals

* (for the moment) to play around with a freely usable TRIZ RDF-ontology based
  on a thorough analysis of appropriate publications to ease the application
  of semantic technologies in that area,

* to collect material, texts and tools around
  [TRIZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ) and its generalizations that can
  be reused under the terms of appropriate [Creative Commons
  licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/).

A first draft of a demo web application is available under
http://opendiscovery.org/.

## The directory structure

* Data - RDF Metadata, a first attempt.
* rdf - a first attempt towards a RDF based TRIZ ontology. 
* Sources - Sources (mainly LaTeX) of several texts.
* Texts - Texts supplied under the terms of CC-BY by different authors.
* web - the sources of the web pages at opendiscovery.org
* workbench - my workbench, to be moved into a feature branch later on.
