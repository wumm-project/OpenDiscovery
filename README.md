# Open Discovery

This project has the goals

* to play around with a freely usable TRIZ RDF-ontology based on a thorough
  analysis of appropriate publications to ease the application of semantic
  technologies in that area,

* to collect material, presentations, texts, pictures and tools around
  [TRIZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ) and its generalizations that can
  be reused under the terms of appropriate [Creative Commons
  licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/).

The RDF data base collected so far is now available in the separate repo
RDFData within this organizational account.

Presentations about the WUMM Project are available from the material section
at our [Github Pages](https://wumm-project.github.io/).

A first draft of a demo web application is available under
http://opendiscovery.org/.

## The directory structure

* Pictures - A collection of pictures useful for presentations of different
  aspects of the TRIZ approach together with known licensing information.
* Sources - Sources (mainly LaTeX) of several texts that can be reused under
  the terms of CC-BY
* Texts - Texts supplied under the terms of CC-BY by different authors.
* web - the sources of the web pages at opendiscovery.org
