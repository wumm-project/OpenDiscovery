# OpenDiscovery

This project has the goals

* to develop a freely usable TRIZ RDF-ontology based on a thorough analysis of
  appropriate publications to ease the applidation of semantic technologies,

* to collect material, texts and tools around
  [TRIZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ) and its generalizations that can
  be reused under the terms of appropriate [Creative Commons
  licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/).

A first draft of a demo web application is available under
http://opendiscovery.org/.
