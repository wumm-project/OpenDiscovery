# Open Discovery

This project has the goals

* to collect sources of presentations, texts, pictures and tools around
  Systematic Innovation (in particular
  [TRIZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ)) that can be reused under the
  terms of appropriate
  [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/).

We collected more material in compiled form without sources in the "Texts"
section at our [Github Pages](https://wumm-project.github.io/) and also at the
[Demonstrations Site](http://wumm.uni-leipzig.de/) of the WUMM Social Network. 

## The directory structure

  aspects of the TRIZ approach together with known licensing information.  See
  the README.md over there.
* Sources - Sources (mainly LaTeX) of texts of several authors and themes that
  can be reused under the terms of CC-BY. See the README.md over there for
  conditions of reuse of the different texts.

  German translation of the exercises and the information letters.
