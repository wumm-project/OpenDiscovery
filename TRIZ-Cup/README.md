# Material of the TRIZ Summit Cup

## The history and motivation

I have large background in the organisation of mathematical olympiads and so
it was no surprise for me to see the very enthusiastic faces of both the
children and the supervisors of the final round of the TRIZ Summit Cup at the
TRIZ Developer Summit in June 2018 in Minsk.

The TRIZ Summit Cup competition was established in 2014 and has been offered
annually since then. The materials and further notes on implementation and
results are available in Russian on the
[website of the competition](https://triz-summit.ru/contest/).

## General Provisions

In this directory general provisions (Information letter, Questionnaire, Rules
of the competition) are collected in the current valid form.  The
authoritative version is in any case the Russian one, English versions are
partly authorized by the organizers, other language versions are provided "as
is" do far without any authorization by the organizers.

This material was formerly stored in the 2020 subdirectory but moved to this
place, since it changes only in small parts over the years.

## The annual competitions

The materials of the annual competitions are provided in the respective
subdirectories.  We moved most of the material from a Word base to LaTeX since

(1) several tasks are the same for different age categories
(2) there are repeating text blocks

This much eases the translation of the material to other languages. Moreover a
text based format as LaTeX is much better suited for search an git storage
purposes.

The authoritative version of the material is in any case the Russian one,
translations are provided "as is" and do not provide material authorized by
the organisators of the contest.
