title: The Open Discovery Project
---

This is a first small hack of a web site for the upcoming Open Discovery
Project that aims at collecting different information about the [TRIZ
methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ) in RDF format for the
public as [Linked Open Data](http://lod-cloud.net/).

The Project operates a [github
repository](https://github.com/hg-graebe/OpenDiscovery) that is planned to be
converted to an organizational account as the project matures.
