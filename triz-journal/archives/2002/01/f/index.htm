<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Abstract:</b> TRIZ /1/ gives main attention to the methods of
revealing and resolving contradictions. For this purpose a sufficiently wide
tool basis was elaborated, which includes ARIZ and its different modifications.
However, the experience in solving real production problems proves that the
greatest difficulties occur at the initial stage of work with a problem proposed
by a customer. In the inextricable tangle of problems, the formulation of which
is not always clear enough, it is sometimes difficult to see the possibilities
to use the tool basis of TRIZ and, moreover, of ARIZ that starts immediately
from formulating a mini-problem. If the real causes of a problem are discerned,
the problem is often solved by simple TRIZ tools and sometimes it is just
removed. The initial situation analysis, characteristic of the early versions of
ARIZ, was forced out of TRIZ and became a kind of independent direction, which,
in a certain sense, loses connection with the further problem-solving process.
Obviously, certain steps are taken in this direction /2/, but they still do not
constitute a self-contained problem-solving technology. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This work presents a scheme of problem solving that starts
from the analysis of the initial situation and ends in solving a mini- or a
maxi-problem. The scheme was developed on the basis of practical use of TRIZ and
is used by the authors in their work for the company SAMSUNG. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Actions in a monitoring area.</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Attempts to solve a problem are generally made by the
customer’s specialists before applying to TRIZ experts. The customer’s experts
try to solve the problem at a required level but are not successful. However,
owing to their attempts to do this, a comparatively well-explored information
area is formed around the initial problem. We call it a “monitoring area”
(Fig.1). In the analysis of the initial situation, it is useful to thoroughly
investigate this area by employing the knowledge of experts and analyzing the
previous experience in solving this problem and the obtained concrete proposals.
Special attention should be paid to the proposals rejected by the customer due
to their obvious impracticability. </p>
<p>The use of G.S.Altshuller's multi-screen scheme that allows determining
subsystems of a <u><b>technical system </b></u>(TS) under analysis and the
supersystem to which this TS belongs, also yields good results while working in
the monitoring zone. Besides, it is useful to establish the entire chain of
evolution of the analyzed TS, at least its closest prototypes. This allows a
better understanding of the logic of transformations preceding the appearance of
the analyzed TS. It often happens that defects existing at one stage of its
development transfer to a next stage. Moreover, improvements introduced at some
stage can also cause undesirable effects in future. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An important tool of investigating the monitoring area is the
analysis of interacting technical systems. For this purpose V.Lenyashin and
L.Chechurin /3/ propose to determine a “harmful” and a “useful” technical system
and to establish peculiarities of their interaction by acting according to the
following scheme:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">determining the “useful” product of a TS in which a problem
  occurs;</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">determining all constituent parts of the TS that produces
  this product and the character of interaction between them (with a compulsory
  inclusion of an energy source and an object worked);</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">determining the “harmful” product that occurs spontaneously
  during the operation of the “useful” TS and causes a removable disadvantage;</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">determining all the constituent parts of the harmful TS
  that produces this “harmful” product, and the character of interaction between
  them (similarly to the “useful” TS);</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finding elements common for the “useful” and “harmful”
  technical systems. </li>
</ul>

</font><b>
<p align="left">Figure. 1: </b>Full structure scheme of the problem resolving
system.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then it is necessary to remove the action of the “harmful” TS
while preserving to the maximum the action of the “useful” one. Using the
effects of G.S.Altshuller’s laws of technical system evolution can do this.</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To terminate the action of “harmful” TS, it is necessary
  and sufficient to remove any of its parts (engine, transmission, working
  component or control unit) determined in accordance with the law of technical
  system completeness. As a rule, it is most convenient to remove the
  transmission of the “harmful” TS. It often happens that some elements of the
  “harmful” TS do not participate or play a very insignificant role in the
  operation of the “useful” TS (normally they come from the previous system due
  to the psychological inertia). In this case they can be relatively easily
  removed by eliminating the “useful” TS’s disadvantage itself. </li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As stated by the law of energy conductivity, to prevent the
  action of the “harmful” TS, it is necessary and sufficient to break the
  passing of energy through all of its parts.<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b> </b>
  </font>In this case the system parts themselves can remain unchanged. </li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To deactivate the “harmful” technical system, it is
  necessary and sufficient to cause mismatch in operation (operational
  periodicity) of parts of this system. The system parts themselves can remain
  unchanged. The law of harmonization of parts of a system requires that its
  parts operate in a certain sequence. Deliberate violation will inevitably
  cause deactivation of the “harmful” TS, just what we aimed to do. </li>
</ol>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem of search for and elimination of the action of
the “harmful” TS is complicated by the fact that this system is normally an
ideal TS. That is, the system does not exist (nobody did anything to organize
it) while the product appears. This is just why it is difficult enough to see
and to prevent its action. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When searching for possible ways of solving the problem thus
treated, it is convenient to use the notion of “anti-system” introduced by
G.S.Altshuller. The anti-system is a system that performs an action opposite to
the “harmful” action. This approach also considerably simplifies the search for
the elements of the “harmful” system while analyzing it, particularly in case it
is not quite clear what is the cause of the “harmful” action. Something of the
kind was done in developing the “analysis of inverse problem” /4/, but without
linking it to the laws of technical system evolution - theoretical foundations
of TRIZ. The proposals of the customer’s experts and the analysis of interaction
between the useful and harmful system serve as a basis for specifying the
initial problem and proposing a number of hypotheses of its solution. </p>

<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Diagram “Christmas Tree”.</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The diagram reflects the scheme of solving a single selected
problem. It is used after the initial problem has been analyzed in the
monitoring area and hypotheses of its solution have been propounded. In making
the diagram (Fig.2.), the basic theses developed by N.Khomenko in OTSM-TRIZ /5/
were used. The use of this diagram implies permanent specification of the
situation by passing from a given problem to its abstract model, constructing an
abstract model of its solution, specifying this model and proposing one or
several conceptual solutions on this basis. </p>

</font><b>Figure. 2: </b>“Christmas tree” diagram. (The diagram was worked out
with participation of E.Novitskaja).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two axes are the basis of the diagram:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">axis X is the axis of the degree of abstraction of the
  situation;</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">axis Y is the axis of ideality of obtained solution
  concepts. </li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The left part of the diagram is the object area where
specific objects are considered and all actions are performed with these
objects. The right part is the abstract area where all the considerations and
actions are performed with abstract descriptions of objects. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The object and abstract areas are separated by a conventional
line that is called the “concept axis”. Here conceptual descriptions of
situations are situated in which both real objects and their parameters and
abstract descriptions are mixed on equality with one another. At the apex of the
diagram “Christmas Tree”, all the three situational levels - object, conceptual
and abstract - merge. A special situation occurs. It is called IFR - an ideal
final result. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem solving process illustrated by the diagram
includes the following transitions: </p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Transition from the initial problem to its conceptual
model.</p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this case, the “skeleton” is singled out of the problem
conditions. The problem is freed from redundant details. It is necessary to
specify the conflicting objects and the peculiarities of their interaction in
time and space, as well as the ideal final result for the considered situation.
</p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. Constructing a technical contradiction.</p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To do this, it is necessary to determine how we can improve
the desired parameters, which characterize the performance of the main useful
function, by means of a conventional method. Then we must check which parameter
of the system worsens to an admissible extent. Then we construct one or several
contradictions in accordance with the list of characteristic features by
G.S.Altshuller. Having received several ideas of solving the technical
contradiction, one can try to find intermediate concepts of solving the problem
by using available resources. </p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. Constructing an abstract model of a problem. </p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To do this, it is convenient to use the rules of su-field
analysis and to draw a scheme of interaction of the elements in the form of a su-field
model. All the objects participating in the conceptual model are replaced with
abstract “substances”, while the forces and interactions are replaced with
corresponding “fields” that characterize the interaction between the objects.
</p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. Constructing an abstract problem-solving model.</p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The solution model is constructed by transforming the
abstract model of the problem by means of:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fundamental knowledge of the problem solver - the so-called
  “experience”.</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The use of analogous problems.</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rules of standard solution of problems. </li>
</ol>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The abstract model solved, it is necessary to make an attempt
to find preliminary problem- solving concepts by analyzing the available
resources once again. </p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. Determining the requirements for the X-elements.</p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a very important stage, which allows making a
description of the X-element necessary for the search for a real object with
available resources. The X-element can be conveniently described according to
the following scheme: </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“Element - Feature of Element - Value of Feature” proposed by
N. Khomenko.</p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6. Constructing a physical contradiction.</p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A physical contradiction occurs when the requirements for the
X-element or its part are physically mutually exclusive. Resolving this
contradiction makes it possible to maximally specify the situation and to obtain
a conceptual solution, the closest one to the ideal solution. </p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7. Constructing a final solution. </p>
</u>
<p>All the three concepts obtained in the process of solving, as well as the
experiments are used to construct a final solution of the considered single
mini-problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. Solving a mini-problem.</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A mini-problem implies the elimination of disadvantages
without a considerable transformation of the initial problem, only by means of
available or easy-to-introduce resources. With limited resources, the solution
of such a problem is often more complicated than in case of a maxi-problem that
allows considerable changes to be made in the initial system. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A mini-problem is solved after propounding several solution
hypotheses obtained together with the customer's experts by analyzing the
monitoring area. A hypothesis is the main, general idea of eliminating a
disadvantage. The entire problem-solving process consists in specifying separate
hypotheses, constructing their object embodiment and specifying their
applicability for solving the main problem in a given situation (Fig.3). </p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image223.gif" width="645" height="445"></p>
</font><b>
<p align="left">Figure. 3: </b>Structure scheme of the mini-problem solution.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the object realization of each hypothesis, the following
situations may occur:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No obstacles occur and the solution is produced
  automatically, by a direct application of known methods. No contradiction
  occurs. </li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is impossible to realize the hypothesis by the known
  methods. A contradiction occurs when using such methods. In this case, a
  solution is obtained using the diagram “Christmas Tree”.</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After solving one of the problems arising during the
  hypothesis realization, new problems occur and it is impossible to realize the
  solution of the previous problems without solving these new ones. In this
  case, a situation occurs which is very similar to the one described by
  N.Khomenko in the technology “A flow of problems”, when some partial solutions
  merge at the end to form a final solution to a problem. </li>
</ol>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After object realization of each hypothesis, a final solution
of a mini-problem is constructed. To do this, the object realization most
suitable for specific conditions is selected together with the customer’s
experts. It is supplemented with other realizations or their useful properties.
The method of constructing a final solution of a mini-problem has very much in
common with the method of combining alternative systems /6/.</p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. Solving a maxi-problem.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solving a maxi-problem is implies considerable transformation
of the initial technical system and its technological processes. The solution
process is similar to the technological forecasting process.<i><b> </b></i>Often
enough, after solving such a problem we obtain a number of patentable proposals
concerning the development of the production process and the technical system
itself. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A maxi-problem is solved by the following scheme:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“Desirable product - Production process - Process-realizing
TS” /Fig.4/. </p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image224.gif" width="657" height="391"></p>
</font><b>
<p align="left">Figure. 4: </b>Structure scheme of the maxi-problem solution.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First it is necessary to accurately determine the
requirements for the product produced by the TS under consideration. We do it by
using the information obtained through analyzing the monitoring area and solving
mini-problems. Then, with the product specified, we construct a desired process
of its production. This is in fact a set of operations to be fulfilled by some
“desirable TS” which will realize this process. Thus, we fulfill the
requirements of the law of harmonization of parts of a system. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having specified the desirable process, it is necessary to
construct the model of the “desirable TS”. This is done in accordance with the
law of technical system completeness and the law of through energy conductivity.
In this case, it is relatively easy to use the body of information obtained by
analyzing the monitoring area and solving a mini-problem. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The distinctive feature of our approach is as follows. When
obtaining each concept of a mini-problem solution, it is very useful to write
out the principle idea of this concept. This may be both the type of
transformation used in problem solving and substance and fields used for this
purpose, or the combination of both. The situations thus obtained are analyzed
with the aid of the trends of technical system development /7/ and their most
ideal embodiment is selected, which is then used for constructing a model of a
“desirable TS”. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For instance, if a transformed object was monolithic in an
initial TS, and, to solve a mini-problem, we used liquid, it would be very
useful to analyze how the problem could be solved by using other monolith
transformations lying in the “Segmentation” axis. It is necessary to check he
applicability of foam, gases, plasma, electric and magnetic fields and vacuum to
constructing the model of a “desirable TS”. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we use a principle, for instance, mono-bi-poly, we must
check how our “desirable TS” can operate when an additional object or several
objects are introduced, or when the object being transformed passes to a
supersystem. Having received a conceptual model of the “desirable TS” (something
close to the notion of the “ideal final result”), it is necessary to solve the
problem occurring in transition from this model to its real embodiment. In TRIZ,
there is a good say: To step back from the IFR.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By performing the above actions, we receive the maximum
efficient transformations that solve the initial problem and point to the most
efficient ways of development of the initial technical system. </p>
