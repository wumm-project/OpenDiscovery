<p>Introduction</p>
</b>
<p>In this, the last article we discuss some of the other tools and strategies
we might use in a problem definition and solving context that can benefit
through integration with the TRIZ system operator.</p>
<p>Following on from the previous tutorial article examining the introduction of
a third dimension dealing with aspects of perception, personal belief and
relationships, the start point here assumes that this three dimensional
space-time-‘interface’ (Figure 1) viewing system applies to all of the aspects
here. For the sake of clarity of illustration, however, we will focus primarily
on the conventional space-time plane seen in the classical TRIZ system operator.</p>

<p>Co-opetition</p>
</b>
<p>The Co-opetition idea of a ‘value net’ previously discussed in Reference 1
provides a first example of the 9-Windows being used in conjunction with other
ways of scoping and framing a given problem or opportunity situation. The ‘value
net’ idea discussed in Co-opetition (Reference 2) is of significant interest
when thinking about a holistic approach to business oriented problems - offering
a much more broad reaching view than would normally be the case. In effect the
‘value net’ appears in each of the windows of the system operator tool - Figure
2.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 2: Combined 9-Windows and Value-Net Concepts</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>The importance of integrating the Co-opetition Customer-Supplier-Competitor-Complementor
model with the 9-Windows emerges because, as Reference 1 suggested, the value
net may well change with respect to both SPACE and TIME. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats (SWOT) Analysis</p>
</b>
<p>By way of a first extension to the co-opetition extension to the 9-Windows,
Figure 3 illustrates a similar integration of the classic
Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis into the system
operator space-time framework.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 3: Combining 9-Windows and SWOT Analysis</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>The SWOT analysis idea is used across a wide range of technical and business
areas as a means of scoping a given problem, opportunity or innovation
situation. It attempts to get the person or team involved in the analysis to
look at their situation from a number of different perspectives - namely, what
are we good at, what are we not so good at, what are the things that could help
us to become good, and what are the things that could stop us from becoming
good.</p>
<p>Combining this thinking approach with the 9-Windows offers a number of
additional useful perspectives. Of particular interest in many situations are
the idea of repeating the SWOT analysis in the 9-Windows ‘Future’ positions and
‘super-system’ positions. With regard to the ‘future’ perspective, the idea of
re-thinking the questions on opportunities and threats can be very important
because it forces the team to think about not just what they think will happen
in the future, but also what they think their competitors and the market will
do. In a related manner, asking the same questions from a super-system
perspective opens the eyes of the team to other industries beyond their own.</p>
<p>By way of example of both, if we put ourselves in the position of a
hypothetical car manufacturer struggling with the idea of developing a
commercially viable electric car then, thinking about ‘threats’ at the system
level present (as a conventional SWOT analysis would), is likely to get us to
think about what other car manufacturers are doing. This is likely to put us
into a psychological inertia hole (Reference 3) that will focus our thinking
onto hybrid vehicles and fuel cells. While this is undoubtedly necessary, it is
far from certain that it is sufficient. Conducting the same SWOT analysis from
the perspective of the super-system ought to point us at already viable electric
transport systems like golf carts and postal delivery vans. According to
Reference 4, it is more likely that these things will evolve and improve to take
over the electric car market than anything developed by Ford or General Motors.
Conducting the SWOT analysis from the ‘future’ perspective would further force
the inclusion of solar energy and battery technology evolution (and, probably as
likely, evolutionary limits), and, at the future-super-system level, global
warming, choking of road systems and development of better public transport
systems.</p>
<p>Thinking about the third ‘interface’ dimension illustrated in Figure 1, it is
interesting to note that the idea of integrating the SWOT analysis into the
different hierarchical levels of ‘interfaces’ (environment, behaviour,
capability, belief, identity) and seeing how the analysis changes between
different viewing perspectives (‘the map is not the territory’ from Reference
1), is already established practice in certain forms of Neuro-Linguistic
Programming (NLP) - see Reference 5 for example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Association/Dissociation</p>
</b>
<p>The NLP theme gives us yet another means of using the 9-Windows to better
effect when we consider the strategy of association and dissociation. Reference
6 discusses the importance and benefits of being able to control whether we
examine situations from either an internal (i.e. we are a part of the
situation), associated state, or whether we chose to view the situation from an
external, dissociated state (we are outside the situation looking in). In many
ways this idea is similar to the 9-rooms idea discussed in the second part of
this tutorial series (Reference 7). Figure 4 presents the basic idea more
explicitly in the context of the 9-Windows tool.</p>

<b>
<p align="left">Figure 4: Combining Association/Dissociation and the 9-Windows
</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>As described in the reference, the ability to associate and dissociate from
any chosen situation is one of the cornerstones of NLP. The model already makes
use of the space-time axes by, for example, helping people to solve (primarily)
human-relations type problems by anchoring to past successes, and transplanting
those anchors into future situations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>VAKOG</p>
</b>
<p>VAKOG stands for visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory and gustatory. The
acronym is a means of enhancing our ability to remember the five main human
senses. The point is that, in a problem-solving context at least, we are often
prone to not only forget any of the senses that are not already being used in
the system. The use of all senses is important in many problem situations -
hence the existence of Inventive Principle 28, Mechanics Substitution - (and its
more closely related ‘Another Sense’ interpretation in a 40 Inventive (Business)
Principles context), and the recent uncovering of a distinct trend in technical
systems towards increasing interaction with more of the human senses (Reference
8). The point in the TRIZ/9-Windows context is that if we recognize the five
senses in not just the context of the current system, but also in the other 8
windows, we can often create new problem definition and solution opportunities.</p>
<p>The basic idea is illustrated in Figure 5 - which hopefully also serves to
reinforce the overall theme of this article - that just about any of the problem
situation framing tools available to us can be re-framed 9 times into the system
operator. 45 times if we chose to use the fully three-dimensional
space-time-interface window structure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too Many Windows?</p>
</b>
<p>Anyone that has struggled through a SWOT analysis or an
Association/Dissociation or any other analysis, will know that it can be very
difficult to maintain concentration (will to live?) through all segments of the
process. So what, therefore, are the chances of maintaining concentration over
potentially nine times the number of segments as is being advocated by the
system operator? Answer; it depends. If done in a single brainstorming session,
the answer is probably as close to zero as makes any difference. If done in
several sessions, or by splitting groups so that each covers different segments,
the chances will increase markedly. The unfortunate truth according to a variant
on Murphy’s Law is that you can probably bet that the ones you chose not to
analyse are the ones that contain the inventive spark that makes the biggest
positive difference. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Final Thought</p>
</b>
<p>The system operator in whatever form we chose to use it is an important
element within the overall TRIZ philosophy. Its presence is (or should be) felt
in just about everything we do with TRIZ. The idea of thinking in space and time
- which is what the 9-Windows are there to help do - is not unique to TRIZ. The
addition of a third dimension called ‘interface’ or ‘relationship’ offers an
important additional thinking direction. Whether we divide things into 9-windows
or 45 or even more, we are simply using the idea of segmentation to help us <b>
manage complexity</b> more effectively than we otherwise would. What we have
hopefully hinted at here is that there are many more ways of applying
segmentation than just segmenting in space or time. Someone out there has
already solved your problem; different people like to segment things in
different ways. Some will be more helpful in certain situations than others, but
ultimately, the best ones will be those that fit into <i>your</i> way of doing
things. Or, in the words of Buckminster Fuller:</p>
<i>
<p>“Start with the universe, any sub-categorisation under that level is purely
arbitrary”</p>
</i>
