<p>I recently received this e-mail from Hugo Sanchez, hsanchez@inpyme.gob.ni,
asking for ideas about using TRIZ in his job, helping small and medium-sized
enterprises in Nicaragua, and combining TRIZ with other improvement concepts.
Ian Care, our TRIZ Challenge editor, has had considerable experience with a
global charitable organization, applying TRIZ in Africa and in Central America,
to problems of delivering relief supplies and to problems of starting local
businesses, and agrees that TRIZ can be used in a wide variety of environments.</p>
<p>I suggested that it might help to study TRIZ in Spanish, and referred Hugo to
the TRIZ XXI web site, http://www.triz.net, developed by TRIZ Journal author
Jose Vicente Gomila. </p>
<p>We hope that our readers will use their TRIZ experience and their business
experience to help Hugo Sanchez in his efforts. Send suggestions directly to
him, or to the TRIZ Challenge.</p>

  Re: TRIZ IN SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES</p>
  <p>Dear TRIZ friends:</p>
  <p>Recently I came across the TRIZ JOURNAL and, frankly, it was an
  extraordinary experience for me. Since then I have been working in how to
  apply the main concepts to the case of Small and Medium Enterprises in the
  particular conditions of a small and poor country, like Nicaragua.</p>
  <p>The general available methods of scientific thinking focus (it can be
  understood!) in problems related with developed countries. It is rather
  difficult to adapt all this information to the peculiar problems we face.</p>
  <p>How things like Deming philosophy, TRIZ methods, and other can be applied
  in our &quot;unusual&quot; circumstances? I would like to receive some comments that
  direction.</p>
  <p>Thanks<br>
  Hugo Sanchez<br>
  Technical Director<br>
  Nicaraguan Institute for the Support of Small and Medium Enterprises.</p>
