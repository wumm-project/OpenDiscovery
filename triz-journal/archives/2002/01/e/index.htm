<p>Introduction</p>
</b>
<p>Different people use TRIZ in different ways. This article builds on
discussions begun at the TRIZ Future 2001 conference in Bath, and is about
trying to find a common ground and understanding between the people describing
themselves as having the ‘TRIZ virus’, and those who don’t have the time, will
or desire to invest a lot of time learning the tremendous amount of available
richness.</p>
<p>We explore the possibilities of structuring TRIZ so that it can accommodate a
full spectrum of user types and capabilities, and also some of the consequent
implications for TRIZ educators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Another Way of Looking at TRIZ</p>
</b>
<p>Is TRIZ a set of tools? A method? A way of thinking? A philosophy? Answer;
all of the above. Figure 1 illustrates a hierarchical perspective of what this
thing called TRIZ is.</p>
<p>At it’s very highest level, TRIZ may be seen as the systematic study of
excellence. This study was initially focused on patents (a very good source of
excellence for the most part), and then evolved to look at excellence in the
sciences, and latterly, the arts, business, social sciences and politics.</p>
<p>Five key philosophical elements have emerged from this study. In no
particular order, these are <font COLOR="#0000ff">Ideality </font>- and the
concept of systems evolving to increasing good, decreasing bad -
<font COLOR="#0000ff">Resources</font> - and the concept of maximizing the
effectiveness of things inside and around a system (even the bad things) -
<font COLOR="#0000ff">Space/Time</font> - and the importance of viewing systems
in terms of their space and time context - <font COLOR="#0000ff">Functionality</font>
- and the over-riding importance of function when thinking about systems - and
<font COLOR="#0000ff">Contradictions</font> - and the concept of contradiction
elimination as a primary evolution driver. Some of these are unique to TRIZ;
some have parallel precedent within other similar studies of creativity.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the TRIZ hierarchy, then, are a wide-ranging and
comprehensive series of tools and techniques. The tools contain a great deal -
some might say overwhelming - level of richness, and to all intents and
purposes, it may be said that there is a tool for practically any problem that
may be encountered.</p>
<p>In between philosophy and this collection of tools is something we might
loosely describe as ‘method’. In actual fact, several methods - with just about
every TRIZ provider presenting their own version of a method to string the tools
together in whatever fashion they think most appropriate. It is at this level
that many of the problems of TRIZ occur. Quite literally the choice and quantity
of available advice is overwhelming for the large majority of people
encountering TRIZ.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 1: Hierarchical View of TRIZ</p>
</b></font>
<p>The essence of philosophy is distillation of large quantities of knowledge
and experience into a small entity. It might take users a considerable amount of
time to appreciate the significance of the five philosophical strands of TRIZ,
but they can at least be remembered in a few minutes.</p>
<p>At the other end of the hierarchy pyramid, the TRIZ toolkit contains a series
of tools that, to varying degrees can be learned and applied also in a
relatively short space of time. There is a deal of variation, but as an average,
a half-day of learning and doing is usually enough to give a newcomer the will,
confidence and ability to use a given tool.</p>
<p>In between toolkit and philosophy, the learning curve for any of the TRIZ
methods and processes (with or without software ‘support’) is probably
measurable in weeks.</p>
<p>‘Weeks’ unfortunately is then at the heart of a big problem for the large
majority of newcomers to TRIZ. A week is a serious investment of time for anyone
in these busy times; there is simply too much else needing to be done, and not
enough time to do it.</p>
<p>Does this mean we should give up? Or does it mean that it might be better to
think about alternative ways of presenting and delivering TRIZ?</p>
<p>This author believes it is the latter.</p>

<b>
<p>Different User Profiles</p>
</b>
<p>Figure 2 illustrates a graph compiled from the experiences of watching
several hundred students, engineers, scientists, strategists and managers go
through at least two-days worth of TRIZ ‘training’. (Admittedly two days is not
a lot in a TRIZ learning context - but it is a fair approximation of the sort of
course it is possible to sell.) </p>

<p align="left">Figure 2: Typical TRIZ User Profiles</p>
</b></font>
<p>The first category of user types is the ‘not for me’ variety. This is the
individual who, for whatever reason (with bad teaching and instinctive aversion
because people have been instructed to attend by their boss being probably the
top two reasons), decides they do not like TRIZ or do not want to commit the
time necessary to learn it.</p>
<p>The second category involves those who discover a part of TRIZ that they like
and chose to adopt it into their way of doing things. This ‘part’ might be a
tool like the Contradiction Matrix or the Trends of Evolution, or it might
simply be one or two of the Inventive Principles. At the end of the experience,
the user has achieved some success using the particular tool or element of, is
‘satisfied’ by that success, and shows no desire to expand their TRIZ knowledge.
In some small way, however, this category of user has been changed by their TRIZ
experience. </p>
<p>The third category of user might be seen as the pragmatist. They usually
start as users of the second category, but find that there are certain types of
problem - or more usually a specific problem - that the TRIZ tool they know has
failed to solve. They therefore look at other elements of TRIZ (or beyond) until
they find something that does solve the problem. The success with the new tool
then prompts the incorporation of that tool into that persons ‘way of doing
things’. (The importance of ‘success’ in determining whether someone picks up a
part of TRIZ or not cannot be under-estimated.)</p>
<p>The fourth category of user profile is what is commonly described amongst
long-time TRIZ users as ‘having the virus’ or ‘being infected’. This type of
user typically reads all of the books, papers and articles they can find on
TRIZ, and sees TRIZ change a large part of their life.</p>
<p>Statistics can be used to show anything, and this author’s data set is not as
large as others, but approximations can nevertheless be very telling. A
breakdown of how people are distributed between the four different categories is
suggested in Figure 3. These figures might have an accuracy of
<font FACE="Symbol">±</font>10 or more percent. Even with that level of
inaccuracy, I think they contain some very important messages for user and
provider alike. We will discuss four.</p>

<p>The Folly of ‘I Am Right; You Are Wrong’</p>
</b>
<p>Everyone has their own way of doing things. Some of these ways are
demonstrably more effective than others, but nevertheless those embedded ways
are present and they are constraints that will dictate how much and which parts
of TRIZ people will be attracted to and which they will reject. There have been
several questions in TRIZ discussion forums along the lines ‘which are the most
important parts of TRIZ?’ The simple answer to the question is that it depends.
It depends on the circumstances of the problem or opportunity under
consideration, it depends on the user, and it depends on how TRIZ is delivered
to them.</p>
<p>Given this belief, it is perhaps surprising that so many in the TRIZ
community insist that their way of doing things is the right way. In simple
terms, in each case, while it might be ‘right’ for them personally, it might be
the complete opposite of right to someone else. So, to take a particular
example, certain versions of ARIZ place the Psychological Inertia tools before
Physical Contradiction separation methods, while others reverse the sequence.
Which is right? Answer; both and neither. It depends.</p>
<p>To take a cooking analogy; there are definitely right and wrong ways of using
the various tools contained in the kitchen. There is a right and a wrong way of
holding a whisk, in the same way that once I have picked the whisk up by the
handle instead of the blades, there is then a considerable degree of flexibility
in how I can use the tool to achieve the desired function; I can stir clockwise
or anti-clockwise, with or without a vertical component of motion, I can stop
and start, I can change speed, I can change direction, I can do pretty much
anything so long as the whisk is in the product and moving it.</p>
<p>At a higher level, I can then use a recipe to help me sequence ingredients
and the things I do to them in order to eventually get me to a finished product.
If I am trying to make soup, I could probably find several hundred recipes to
help me do it. Some will say put the stock in first, and some will say don’t.
Assuming that the different authors are all trying to help me make soup that is
edible, we can probably safely assume that each of them has created a recipe
that will work. Some recipes will produce better (to me!) soup than others, but
they will all provide me an output that looks and functions like soup.</p>
<p>The point? For users - find something that fits your way of doing things
(whether it be one Inventive Principle or a complete problem solving
method/recipe). For providers - think carefully before you tell people that your
way of doing things is ‘the right way’. You can probably guarantee that it is
not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Self-Adapting Systems</p>
</b>
<p>The folly of ‘I am right; you are wrong’ (see Reference 2 if you want more
information on the subject) is somewhat paradoxical given the importance of
identifying and eliminating contradictions within TRIZ. So is it psychological
inertia tools before or after contradictions in ARIZ? Or would the smart
solution be either? Or neither? Perhaps it would be useful to see it as a
physical contradiction separable on condition. Psychological inertia tools
before contradictions IF that’s what I prefer; contradictions before
psychological inertia tools IF I don’t.</p>
<p>A large proportion of users will only ever know and use one or two tools of
TRIZ. Reference 3 suggests the importance of ‘self’ in the drive towards
increased ideality; self-adjusting, self-organising, etc, and any system that
works out ‘for itself’ what is right are all good solution directions. If TRIZ
is about encouraging people to think, perhaps a useful goal would be to offer
them a structure that allows them to - as much as is feasibly practical - mix
and match tools (both within and beyond TRIZ) to suit their particular
individual circumstances. In other words, that they are able to adapt what tools
and methods they use, how and when they use them to suit themSELVEs.</p>
<p>If I choose to ignore a recipe that is my decision. If I’m making soup it
doesn’t matter-I may get a thin soup or a thick one or even a stew, but it will
be edible. If I’m making bread, and stray too far from the recipe, I will end up
with something that isn’t bread, and might not even be edible, or I might end up
with something exciting and new. The former is usually more likely than the
latter however, so in future, I might be well advised to follow some form of
structure. I also know that I have my own tastes and that if I take a bit of
this recipe and add a bit of that and then add this bit of my own, then I will
end up with my ideal bread. ‘My’ being the important word.</p>
<p>If we ask ourselves the question is it better for me to adapt to TRIZ or for
TRIZ to adapt to me, I think for the most part, many of us (especially those
working in a time-constrained environment) would choose the latter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Mastery</p>
</b>
<p>The profiles illustrated in Figure 2 bear some striking similarities to the
profiles described in G Leonard’s book ‘Mastery’ (Reference 1). The book
describes the four broad categories as ‘dabblers’, ‘hackers’, ‘masters’ and
‘obsessives’ respectively. The book makes two points that have particular
relevance to the latter two categories:</p>
<p>The first is that the third profile in the figure - the ‘I’ll learn a new bit
when I need it’ category - is the most effective route to ‘mastery’ of a
subject. The book makes the point that the time gap between picking up
successive new capabilities (i.e. the flat parts on the graph) is an important
part of the knowledge acquisition process. The gap is useful because it provides
an opportunity for consolidation; it allows the brain to fully embrace the new
capability. In many senses it emphasizes the importance of a learning-doing
cycle as a fundamental necessity in ‘mastering’ anything new.</p>
<b></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p>The second interesting point made by the book involves the ‘TRIZ virus’ or
‘obsessive’ profile. The book actually draws a different characteristic profile
of the ‘obsessive’ character. It looks something like the picture illustrated in
Figure 4.</p>

<p align="left"><img border="0" src="04.gif" width="150" height="189"></p>
<b>
<p align="left">Figure 4: Propensity to ‘Burn-Out’ In Obsessives</p>
</b></font>
<p>In other words, there is a very strong correlation between obsessive drive
towards a goal and burn-out. The characteristic is reported to be particularly
common in situations where individuals pursue singular or non-diverse pursuit of
a particular tool or method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Overlap</p>
</b>
<p>Some (many?) people complain or are concerned that TRIZ appears to contain a
considerable amount of overlap. This overlap exists between different tools, but
it also exists within the same tool - note for example how much overlap exists
in amongst just the Inventive Principles.</p>
<p>The response of some people to this overlap - particularly among TRIZ
providers - is to eliminate it. This is perhaps understandable given that the
overlap can become frustrating after a few years of using TRIZ.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what about the 50% of people that will only ever learn one
part of TRIZ? Or the next 35% who will expand their knowledge only after what
might be a considerable period of time? Is the overlap useful to them or not?
Two answers; firstly as they are not aware of the bigger picture they are
unlikely to be aware of any overlap and so it cannot harm or frustrate them.
Secondly, if they are using TRIZ to try and solve a problem - or, in other
words, ‘achieve a benefit’, the existence of overlap means that they are more
likely to reach a solution. The point is made again in Figure 5.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

</font><font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 5: The Overlap Advantage - in Case A, if the user
doesn’t know the relevant tool they will not solve the problem. In case B, they
have several opportunities to reach a successful solution.</p>
</b></font><b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Final Thought</p>
</b>
<p>There are generally believed to be two basic ways of achieving a goal. The
first involves having a clear vision of what the goal is and an absolute
determination to achieve it no matter what the obstacles are. The second
involves having a clear vision of what the goal is, and an absolute
determination to maximize the use of available resources to help reach the goal.
The first might be called ‘brute force’; the second ‘harnessing natural forces’.
Both can succeed. One route is harder work than the other. </p>
<p>The same choice exists when thinking about the spread and use of TRIZ. We can
bludgeon people until they submit, or we can recognize that everyone is
different, learns in different ways and wants different things. We can force
them to do it our way, or allow them sufficient slack to adapt TRIZ (and indeed
other tools, methods, and philosophies) to suit their particular differences.
One is more likely to succeed than the other. One is harder work than the other.</p>
