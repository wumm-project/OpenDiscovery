<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Abstract.</b> The article analyzes the failure of the Russian
project �Znamya 2�, which is better known as �Space Mirror�. When unfolding, the
space mirror membrane caught on the antenna that projected over the space
station body. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Using TRIZ, the causes of the failure were analyzed and a
number of solutions for improving the reliability of the flexible membrane
unfolding under weightlessness were proposed.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introduction</b>. The space mirror that reflects the Sun�s
rays onto the nightside of our planet is one of the impressive space projects.
In 1993, the spaceship �Progress M-15� placed into orbit a 20-meter film mirror
(the project �Znamya 2�). The mirror unfurled and produced a light spot that was
equal in strength approximately to one full moon. A huge plash of sunlight
glanced over beclouded Europe to be seen only by astronomers on the top of the
Alps. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The project �Znamya 2.5� stood head and shoulders above its
predecessor. The mirror was expected to be perceived on the Earth as 5 to 10
full moons and it formed a trace of about 7 km in diameter which could be
controlled by fixing it on one spot for a long time. The space mirror was a
slightly concave membrane of 25 m in diameter made of thin film with a mirror
surface, which was attached around the periphery of the station. The membrane
was expected to unfold and be held unfolded by centrifugal forces (Fig.1).</p>

</font><font size="2">
<p align="left">Fig.1</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the project was a failure. Soon after the deployment
started, the membrane caught on the antenna (Fig. 2). The spaceship �Progress
M-40 was de-orbited and buried in the ocean. </p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

</font><font size="2">
<p align="left">Fig. 2</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be interesting to consider this situation in terms
of TRIZ. Why exactly hasn�t the membrane unfolded? Has everything been done for
it to unfold? What can be done to make such membranes unfold under various
conditions? There is a great many of similar constructions and it is not always
possible to provide such unfolding conditions as for the solar mirror.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Was this failure natural? In principle, from the point of
view of traditional design everything is OK. The membrane�s prototype is a
parachute canopy. There is no oncoming air stream in space, so inertia forces
that occur as a result of the space station rotation are used to unfold the
membrane. The first membrane - that of �Znamya 2� - unfolded successfully.
Besides, there is a good analogue - designs of spaceships with a solar sail in
which the sail is unfolded and held by a centrifugal force occurring during the
spaceship rotation. It also seems correct in the context of TRIZ. The basic
requirement of ideality is satisfied - the membrane itself <i>without any
additional devices</i> moves off the station, unfolds and is held unfolded. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This, however, has not worked. The station started rotating,
the membrane began moving off it and caught on the antenna. We can certainly
blame the antenna. Parachute-jumpers thoroughly remove all buckles, hooks and
heelplates - everything on which the parachute may caught while deploying - from
their clothing and especially from the helmets and footwear. But the space
station is an expensive and serious thing and is designed to solve many
different problems during one flight. It is difficult to remove all devices from
the station�s surface, as they are needed for solving other problems. Under such
conditions, one accidental jerk of the engine can cause inertia to throw the
unfolding membrane back onto the antenna. </p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rational membrane-unfolding technology.</b> Let us try to
solve this problem with the aid of TRIZ and find a method for unfolding the
membrane without removing the antennas and other objects projecting over the
station�s surface. Unfortunately, we�ll only have to be guided by the published
information, so we�ll have to think ourselves of such important �trifles� as the
design of membrane-holding devices, locks, etc. Or, for instance, what are the
radial slits in the membrane for?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, we have a packed membrane attached around the periphery
of the station. It is held, for instance, by several flexible bands with locks
(Fig. 3, a).</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

</font><font size="2">
<p align="left">Fig. 3</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us recall one of the basic TRIZ laws - the law of
coordination of ES parts� interaction - and try to build a �desirable
technology� of membrane deployment. The deployment process falls into two
distinct stages. At the first stage, the station starts rotating, locks are
released and the membrane moves off the station�s surface (Fig. 3,d). The second
stage includes the unfolding of the membrane, its final stretching and holding
in the unfolded state. (Fig.3,c).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first stage is apparently most complex. Since the entire
mass of the packed membrane is situated near the axis of rotation, centrifugal
forces are comparatively small at that moment, while the work to be done by them
is considerable. At the same time, certain requirements are also imposed on the
sequence of membrane deployment. It would be better for the membrane not to
unfold at once throughout the entire volume, but from the center toward the
edges, quickly receding from the station to the area that is free from
projecting antennas, in the form of a compact torus-like packing and not as an
inordinate heap. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further stretching of the unfolded membrane is not connected
with any troubles because at that time the membrane is already far from the
�human factor�. Here we can do with centrifugal forces. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, we can formulate an important requirement for the
deployment process: �the unfolded internal part of the membrane must be
permanently stretched�.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can we accomplish sequential unfolding of the membrane?
The chances are that it is �concertinaed� before the flight and then it is
unfolded throughout the entire volume after releasing the locks.</p>

    <p>Proposal 1</b>.</font><font size="2"> Leave free some of the folds
    adjoining the station and fasten the rest of the folds together with
    destroyable filaments or bands. Then peripheral tensile stress will first
    spread the folds near the station surface and the part of the membrane
    adjoining the station will be stretched. And only then the ties of the
    peripheral part of the membrane will break and the final deployment will
    start (Fig.4).</p>

<p align="left">Fig. 4.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can we accelerate the membrane deployment at the first
stage?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is obvious that we can either increase the station
spinning frequency or increase the membrane mass. But carrying an extra load is
not an ideal solution. Suppose we first spin up the station and then release the
locks� And suppose we place a ring charge BB under the packed membrane, then
release the membrane from the locks and explode the charge! Or place small jet
engines around the external periphery of the membrane� </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Something will definitely fly to pieces, because the membrane
is only 7 </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">m</font><font size="2">m thick.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are the requirements for the membrane mass in this case?</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the one hand, the membrane must be heavy to be able to
  unfold fast and to move off the station.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same time, the membrane must be lightweight to
  prevent the occurrence of excessive loads produced by centrifugal forces. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can resolve this contradiction in the following way.
    Let the membrane be heavy at the first stage of deployment and lightweight
    during the rest of the time. Or rather, the unfolding force must be great at
    the first stage. Then it may be much smaller, but great enough to unfold and
    stretch the membrane. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eliminating possible catching.</b> As for possible hooking of

</p><ul>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The membrane must not catch on a hook.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the deployment conditions, the membrane can contact a

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, it would be ideal to remove the conditions that
cause the membrane catching. But if we cannot eliminate such a probability, it
is necessary to make so that the caught membrane can be easily released. How can
we resolve this contradiction?</p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Firstly, we can do this in time. </p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the first stage of deployment, when the catching is most
probable, the unfolding force should be large enough to secure tearing a piece
out of the membrane cloth. The peace should be big enough only for normal
unfurling and stretching of the unfurled membrane. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is achieved by introducing additional forces at the
first stage of deployment (Proposals 2 and 3) to help the peripheral centrifugal
force. </p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, we can do this in space.</p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For this purpose we use a resource: the membrane material.
</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can formulate the following requirement for this material.
Let the membrane have rigid surface in close proximity to the station and let
the surface become flexible and elastic as the membrane moves off the station.

    moves off the station in the form of compact torus-like packing. The packed
    membrane may be placed inside a rigid thin-walled body with an open bottom
    (Fig. 7). Because during the deployment the circumference of the packed
    membrane constantly increases, the body must be corrugated and must extend
    like accordion. Or it must be composed of several sections that move
    relative to one another. The use of such a body provides a good protection
    of the packed membrane against hooking and allows for preserving its compact

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The membrane is likely to have equal strength in all
directions. This is quite correct for that of its parts, which is situated
comparatively far from the station. At the same time, the requirements for the
central part of the membrane are contradictory:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Radial filaments must be comparatively durable to provide
reliable attachment of the membrane to the station body. Tangential filaments

reinforcement. </p>

  <dir>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To provide fast and energetic unfolding of the middle

    we�ll practically instantly obtain a rigid frame that will ensure energetic
    unfolding of the membrane at the first stage. </p>
    <p>To hold the membrane in a compact packed state until the full unfolding
    of its middle part, it is proposed to make each of the membrane-holding
    clamps in the form of two pipes that encompass the membrane on its sides.
    The pipes� end faces should be closed and connected with the rest of the
    frame. The pipes� ends should be connected with each other with a break-off
    band or filament. After the full unfolding of the frame of the membrane�s
    middle part, compressed air starts going into the clamps� pipes. The pipes
    straighten with a great force, break the bands and release the membrane

corrected and after the next attempt we�ll see a hand-made sun in the night sky.
