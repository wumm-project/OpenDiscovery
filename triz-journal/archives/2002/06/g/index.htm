<p>Simplified TRIZ: New Problem-Solving Applications for Engineers &amp;
Manufacturing Professionals</u> is an excellent introduction to the foundations
and capabilities of TRIZ. This book is directed at professionals interested in
expanding their methodologies and capabilities without dedicating an exorbitant
amount of time to learning a new science. </p>
<p>The authors do an outstanding job of briefly explaining fundamental concepts
associated with TRIZ. The examples are clear, concise, and easily understood by
non-technical readers. It is the reviewer�s beliefs that this book breaks
through the traditional correlation of TRIZ and manufacturing/technical
processes and gives numerous examples of business, managing, personal examples
(as well as technical and manufacturing examples).</p>
<p>The first eleven chapters outline basic TRIZ principles while coaching and
encouraging problem analysis and idea development through mini-exercises. These
exercises invite reader participation while the numerous examples help to
clarify the principles and demonstrate the limitless situations for which TRIZ
can be applied. The reviewers have found that in other TRIZ literature, examples
are often limited to a technical nature, which can be difficult to understand if
there is no previous knowledge in the technical area from which the example is
drawn. This is not the case here. Here is a table indicating the chapter topics:</p>

<p>Chapter 12 briefly outlines how to integrate TRIZ into various working
environments that already utilize other methodologies. Chapters 13-14 discuss in
detail integrating TRIZ with The Theory of Constraints and Six Sigma Quality
Improvement, respectively. Chapters 15-16 provide a brief summary of the book
and encourage readers to try the methodology themselves.</p>
<p>It is apparent that the authors are well versed in TRIZ and have done an
excellent job breaking down and outlining the basic components of the
methodology. The numerous examples would allow someone who has never heard of
TRIZ to understand all the components addressed. The authors have included
numerous exercises and templates that any TRIZ practitioner would find
beneficial and useful.</p>
<p>This book is clearly a positive contribution to the body of TRIZ literature
and the authors should be commended for their efforts. This book is a must read
for any serious student of TRIZ. As stated previously, there is an abundance of
non-technical examples that should benefit the reader. This book could enhance
any pedagogical TRIZ system and Dr. Slocum intends to incorporate the books
usage in his graduate level courses on TRIZ. There is also a web-page link that
will provide the templates used in the book as well as a few other resources
that will be made available to the readers. </p>
