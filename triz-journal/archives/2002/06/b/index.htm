<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1 Introduction</p>
</b><font FACE="SimSun" LANG="ZH-CN" size="2">
</font><font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Future will be different from the present and changes will
certainly be happen. Technology is responsible for many of the most important
changes. Forecasting future advantages in technology and their impact can be
vital for top management in any manufacturing firms. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The technology forecasting, which is developed in western
countries, can be divided into normative and exploratory[1-3]. The
exploratory covers those techniques based upon an extension of the past through
the present and into future. The normative approach starts from the future and
then traces backwards to present. The main characteristics of successful methods
are quantification and timescales of the parameters to describe the technology.
</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The TRIZ technology forecasting, which is developed in USSR
by Altshuller[4-5] has different versions now: evolution of technique (ET)[6],
guided technology evolution[7], directed evolution (DE)[8]. The main
characteristics of TRIZ methods are that several patterns and paths in structure
forms for evolution of technology have been abstracted from researching a lot of
patents. These patterns and paths are more easily followed and used by product
designers and researchers. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the recent trends is to integrate TRIZ with other
methods to strengthen their strong points. Terninko[9] integrates QFD, TRIZ and
Tanuchi to form a customer-driven robust innovation. In his model, TRIZ is
responsible for solving problems and generating creative solutions. Noel
Leon[10] develops a conceptual design model using QFD/FA/TRIZ, in which TRIZ is
also to solve problems. Schlueter[11] uses IWB2000, which is a TRIZ based
software, to introduce structure into customer requirements of QFD. Savransky[6]
mentions that the knowledge of ET, which is a branch of TRIZ, should be used as
the input of QFD. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Voice of the customers (VOC) is first step for product
design. A methodology to obtain VOC from the knowledge of TRIZ technology
forecasting integrated with Kano�s model[12] will be studied in this paper.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2 Voice of Customers</p>
</b><font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Voice of the customers (VOC) is the words and phrases that
customers use to describe their wants and needs. Customers will be satisfied
only with products and services that meet or exceed their wants and requirements
at a price that represents value. This means that firms must actively seek out
and understand what their customers really want. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kano�s model [12] in Fig.1 shows three categories of customer
requirements.</p>

</font>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2"><b>Expected requirements</b> are
    �self-evident� and unspoken. 100% fulfillment of these aspects will never
    satisfy a customer. On contrary, when these requirements are absent or
    exhibit a failure, customers will be dissatisfied. </p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2"><b>Revealed requirements</b> are
    expressed in one-way or the other. They are not hidden. The degree of
    fulfillment is highly correlated with customer satisfaction. </p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2"><b>Exciting requirements</b> are
    not expected and are not asked for. However, should they be available by the
    product, customer can become very exited.
    </font> </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the most important task to identify customer
requirements. There are two patterns to obtain the customer requirements, which
are �pull� and �push�. A general practice for pattern �pull� is as following:</p>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Directly use the product, in
    which designers are �to be the customers�.</p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Circulate questionnaires.</p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Hold focus group discussions with
    multiple customers.</p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Conduct interviews.</p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Go to the locations or places
    where the products are actually used by customers for designers to obtain
    information directly. This is called �Gemba�. </p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Look at competitors� products.
    </p>
    </li>
</ul>
    </font><font FACE="SimSun" LANG="ZH-CN" size="2">
</font><font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The requirements obtained above are the raw materials and
could not be used by R&amp;D department or designers directly. After analysis of
them a weighted customer requirement list is developed for use in designs. The
characteristic for �pull� pattern is that the wishes, wants, and needs of
customers for products pull the R&amp;D process and designs for products.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second pattern is �push�. Akia Morita, founder of Sony
Corporation, boasts �our plan is to lead the public to new products rather than
ask them what they want, The public does not know what is possible, we do.�
[13]. The result is products such as the Betamax. This is a typical pattern of
�push�. Behind this, a new idea with possible implementation of technology
produced in a manufacturing firm�s internal environment pushes the design and
offers the market something new for which the customers are prepared to pay.
Generally, the sources of knowledge for new ideas arise outside the company and
reside in experts and publications. Twiss[1] proposes a procedure to capture
them as following:</p>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Identification of sources of
    knowledge.</p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Using these sources.</p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Evaluation of the significance of
    the knowledge.</p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Acquisition and transfer into the
    company.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
    </font><font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Savransky[6] mentions that knowledge about evolution of
technique can be used in marking of innovation. If the trends and paths of
technical evolution in TRIZ are used one of the method for �push� pattern is
formed. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
</font><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3 TRIZ Technology Forecasting</p>
</b><font FACE="SimSun" LANG="ZH-CN" size="2">
</font><font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If technological process consisted of a succession of random
events any attempt to forecast would be impossible. Fortunately, analysis of
historical data from a considerable number of phenomena shows that process is
not random but follows regular patterns[1]. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The TRIZ technology forecasting developed by Altshuller[4] is
a set of patterns and paths, which show the trends of technological systems
evolution in structures. These patterns and paths are revealed by analysis of
hundreds of thousands of invention descriptions available in the world patent
databases. The most important finding is that the patterns and paths revealed in
one engineering field can be transferred to other kinds of artificial
systems[6]. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are different visions of description and contents for
TRIZ technology forecasting, which are all development of traditional technology
forecasting of TRIZ developed by Altshuller[4]. Savransky[6] introduces
Evolution of Technique (ET) as the technology forecasting in TRIZ. Fey and Rivin
[7] presents Guided Technology Evolution of TRIZ. Zusman et al[8] of Ideation
International Inc. describe Directed Evolution (DE) and its application. There
is a little difference among these versions. This paper only applies the
knowledge having been developed and DE is selected. The DE is introduced as
following.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are eight patterns of evolution according to DE, which
are as following.</p>
    </font>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Stages of evolutions. </p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Uneven development of subsystems.</p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Increasing ideality.</p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Increasing dynamism and
    controllability.</p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Increasing complexity, followed
    by simplicity.</p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Matching and mismatching of
    parts.</p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Transition toward micro-level and
    increasing use of fields.</p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Decreasing human involvement.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
    </font><font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several paths for every pattern. According to
Zusman et al[8], over 350 paths of evolution have been identified to date in DE.
</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DE can be shown using a tree as a sorting method in Fig.2.

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ-based technological forecasting has following advantages
(Savransky, 2000)[6]:</p>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Point to subsystems that should
    be improved.</p>
    </li>
    </font>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Avoid development of subsystems

    patent fence around promising techniques at the stages of childhood and
    growth and destroy the patent fences of competitors at the growth and
    maturity stages of evolution.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
    </font><font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first step for product design is VOC. If the ideas
produced from the knowledge of DE for a selected product are a kind of
information feedback to the marketing and R&amp;D department of a firm the
decision-making will be strengthen.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
</font><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4 Voice of Customers Driven by Directed Evolution</p>
</b><font FACE="SimSun" LANG="ZH-CN" size="2">
</font><font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The exciting requirements of VOC are usually hidden and
customers do not know them. Designers should find them and implement them in the
products to be designed. The DE of TRIZ can be used to support designers to find
exciting requirements. The Fig. 3 is a model to integrate Kano�s model and DE to
produce exciting requirements. Here, the model is called VOC pushed by DE and
includes four steps.</p>
<blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Step 1: Select a specific product. This is a start
      point for redesign. It should be selected according to long or short-term
      goal of the firm. If it is not necessary to carry out analysis of life
      cycle, for example for the redesign of a component, turn to Step 3.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Step 2: Decide its location in the S-curve. The data of
      the selected product is analyzed and the location in the S-curve is
      determined. If it is in maturity or decline stages new core technology
      should be found following Step 3. If it is in childhood or growth,
      optimization should be carried out to make improvements. The data for a
      product include profit with time, inventions number with time, inventions
      level with time and performance with time.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Step 3: Chose an advanced state. There are eight
      patterns and many paths of evolution for products. A state from patterns
      and paths is chosen as the object of design for the selected product. In
      this step, customers may invite to make some evaluations when choosing one
      from several possible states. </p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Step 4: Abstract customer requirements. Three
      categories of customer requirements are abstracted from the selected
      advanced state for the product together with the questionnaires and gemba.
      The exciting requirements are mainly abstracted from the advanced state of
      the product. Also, customers should be asked to give their ideas. The
      output of this step is a customer requirement list for the following
      design stages. </p>

</font><font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A simple example is selected as an engineering case here.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One type of fixture for machine manufacturing is produced in
a firm of China, which is shown in Fig.4. A clasping mechanism, which is a
subsystem of a fixture used in machine center, is a screw mechanism. The
mechanism is operated by an operator's hand. The speed for clasping and
releasing a workpiece is slow and not suitable for the mass production of
mechanical elements. It should be improved to suit fast operations. The
following are the four steps to obtain new customer requirements for its
redesign. </p>

</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the firm, different types of fixtures are produced. In one
type as shown in Fig.4, the middle staged one in volume has a great market
potential. It is selected as the specific product and start point for the
redesign.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Step 3: Chose an advanced state </p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because it is needed to redesign the clasping mechanism and
the fixture body is not needed to be changed, turn to the Step 3.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are eight patterns and many paths in AD. Designers
should try different patterns and paths and determine one pattern and one path
and one or two states in the path as the final selected general concept of the
solution to be searched. This process is done and pattern 4,one path in that
pattern are selected.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pattern 4 of the DE is �increasing dynamism and
controllability�. One of the evolution paths under this pattern is shown in Fig.
5.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="02e.gif" width="449" height="343"></p>
<p align="left">Fig. 5 Path of �increasing dynamism and controllability�</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now the product is in state of �one joint� in the path. And
advanced state should be in �liquid�, which is decided by detailed analysis.
�Liquid� here means oil hydraulic system, in which a hydraulic cylinder as a
�tool� should be used for the reason of reducing dimension.</p>

<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Step 4: Abstract customer requirements</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hidden exciting requirement is �fast clasping and
releasing�. In designer�s mind it should be implemented using a hydraulic
system.</p>

be obtained from marketing department of the firm or from the designers
themselves directly. Table 1 shows the three kinds of requirements.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two patterns �pull� or �push� for product designs are
defined. In �push� pattern, the new idea with possible implementation of
