<p>Abstract</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An evolved version of TRIZ containing a series of generically
predictable technology and business evolution trends uncovered from the
systematic analysis of patents, academic journals and business texts. The
current state of the art now brings the total number of generic technical trends
to over 30, and the number of business trends to over 20. The article describes
some of the newly discovered trends, and their incorporation into a design
method that allows individuals and businesses to first establish the relative
maturity of their current systems, and then, more importantly, identify areas
where �evolutionary potential� exists. The article introduces this concept of
evolutionary potential - defined as the difference between the relative maturity
of the current system, and the point where it has reached the limits of each of
the evolution trends - through a number of case study examples focused on the
design and evolution of both technical and business systems.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. INTRODUCTION</p>
</b><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ is built on a considerable database of research and the
systematic study of a significant proportion of the world�s most successful
patents [1, 2]. The method thus seeks to encapsulate the best practices of the
world�s best inventive minds and, by using the patent database as its source
material, offers users the ability to strip away all barriers between different
industry sectors. One of the key findings of the research shows that different
industries have historically done a lot of wheel re-inventing, and that good
ideas travel relatively slowly between different sectors.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The research has also demonstrated that there are a number of
generic technology evolution trends that determine the evolution of all
technical systems. These trends describe evolution towards:-</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
</p><ul>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">systems with increasing benefits and decreasing cost and
  harm</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">increased dynamization within systems</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">increased system segmentation</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">increased space segmentation</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">increased surface segmentation</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">increased controllability</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">increased complexity followed by reduced complexity</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">use of all available physical dimensions within a system</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">decreased number of energy conversions</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">increased rhythm co-ordination</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">increased action co-ordination</li>
</ul>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In each case, researchers have identified a number of generic
evolution steps up to and including a �final� level of evolutionary potential.
The trends and the �evolutionary potential� concept act together as powerful
guides to help determine the future development opportunities and limits for a
wide variety of technical and business systems.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The article describes an updated version of the classic TRIZ
trends and the results of a series of short studies to apply them to the design
of a variety of systems, starting with bearing and lubrication systems for
hydraulic applications, passing through analysis of a novel synthetic material,
and ending with the analysis of a hypothetical organisation system. In focusing
on this broad span of applicability, the article is able to both describe some
of the uncovered trends, and to demonstrate the importance of the interactions
that exist between different parts of the system. In other words, to describe
how the evolution of one part of a system can and will influence the design of
other parts.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In so doing, the article also introduces a method for
categorising the evolution trends into space, time and interface categories, and
from there to the creation through which it becomes possible for business or
technical system designers to quickly and accurately identify areas of their
designs in which there is maximum potential for value generation, and, equally
important, in which fundamental evolutionary limits are already being
approached. The method is thus also seen as a potentially important strategic
investment appraisal tool, in addition to its ability to offer unprecedented
quality and quantity of knowledge on the what, how, why and when�s of product
and business evolution across a broad spectrum of application scenarios.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The article begins with a section describing the concepts of
ideality and evolutionary potential. The next section integrates descriptions of
the generic technology evolution trends with their application to predicting the
future evolution of bearing systems. This section ends with the inclusion of the
evolutionary potential diagram for bearing systems. A third section then applies
a larger range of the uncovered evolution trends to draw the equivalent
evolutionary potential diagrams for a polyamide impact modifier material system.
A fourth section examines the business equivalent trends and evolutionary
potential plotting capability and applies it to the definition of a hypothetical
organisation structure. A short final section speculates on the research and
intellectual property implications of the capabilities offered by the evolved
TRIZ trends.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.1 Ideality</p>
</b><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the main pillars in the TRIZ philosophy is the concept
of systems evolving in the direction of increasing ideality (defined as the sum
of the good things in a system divided by the sum of the bad things). The
concept also includes the idea of an �ideal final result (IFR)� - defined as the
evolutionary limit of a system in which all of the good things are delivered,
and all of the bad things have disappeared. While this might sound somewhat
fanciful on many levels, there are nevertheless many cases where such an IFR has
been realised; this is particularly so when considering components within a
bigger system. </p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea of a bearing system in which the user achieves the
useful function of the bearing without the bearing actually existing is one of
those examples where the IFR is probably some distance into the future. An
important thought when comparing the exercise here with the idea of an IFR
bearing involves starting with an existing system and using the trends to
project its evolutionary limits, rather than adopting the usual IFR practice of
starting from IFR and working backwards. Thus it will be seen that in going
forwards from the known it may well become apparent that the evolutionary limits
of a given design style - in the first instance �rolling element contact
bearing� - will fall short of the IFR. The overall concept is illustrated in
Figure 1.</p>

Concepts.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This �starting from today and projecting forwards� philosophy
is justified on the grounds that may organisations do not have the freedom to
simply shift to another - potentially very different - design philosophy. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.2 Evolutionary Potential</p>
</b><font SIZE="1"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Putting the IFR concept on one side, the remaining bulk of
this article looks at the exemplar hydraulic system components from the rather
more pragmatic standpoint of starting from a current design, observing where it
appears relative to the TRIZ predicted technology evolution trends, and
consequently examining how much closer to ideality it has the ability to evolve.
A component or system that has evolved all the way along each of the TRIZ trend
may be said to have reached its evolutionary limit. Any unexploited evolution
steps represent �evolutionary potential� [3]. The evolutionary potential plot
illustrated in Figure 2 is used as a way of describing how far along each of the
TRIZ trends a given system has evolved. </p>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

<font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 2: Evolutionary Potential Radar Plot.</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each spoke in the plot represents one of the TRIZ trends
relevant to the given component. The outside perimeter of the plot represents
evolutionary limit, and the shaded area represents how far along each trend the
current system has evolved. Thus the area difference between shaded area and
perimeter is a measure of evolutionary potential.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The construction of an actual evolutionary potential plot is
best observed through consideration of a real example. We start below with a
state of the art rolling contact element bearing: </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2 BEARING SYSTEM DESIGN</p>
</b><font SIZE="1"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The start point for defining the evolutionary potential of
hydraulic system bearings has been to randomly select a recent granted patent.
US patent 6,296,395, granted in October 2001 to FAG in Germany has been chosen
as a suitable starting point. The self-aligning bearing concept is illustrated
in Figure 3 below.</p>
<font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

<p align="left">Figure 3: Exemplar State Of The Art Bearing System.</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="1"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The evolutionary potential assessment task involves comparing
the bearing design with each of the TRIZ trends in order to find a point along
the trend that best describes the current evolutionary state of the design. By
way of example, Figure 4 describes the TRIZ trend known as �space segmentation�.
The trend shows a progression observed in other systems from solid to hollow to
multi-hollow to capillary to active designs. As in all the other trends being
presented, TRIZ depicts an evolutionary progression from left to right across
each trend, in which benefits increase as a design travels further rightwards.</p>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><img SRC="Image36.gif" width="400" height="62"></font></p>
<font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 4: Space Segmentation Trend.</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the US6,296,395 design, it may thus be observed that the
design uses solid ball/roller structures. As such it has evolved along only one
out of the possible five evolution stages (NB obviously the idea of hollow ball
construction predicted by the trend has been achieved elsewhere and hence the
equivalent evolutionary potential plot for that system would denote two out of
the possible five stages of evolution). The space segmentation spoke on the
radar plot the shaded area boundary for the chosen invention however will be
drawn one-fifth of the way along a spoke with five graduation marks.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of the current design, the task of the designer is
now to work out what benefits may be accrued by tapping into the unexploited
evolutionary potential. In other words, how would a hollow or multi-hollow or
capillary structure offer benefits over the current hollow design? Possible
examples might include increased strength/weight ratio, increased lubrication
carrying capability and so on. The identification of such benefits often results
in the opportunity to generate significant new intellectual property. For
obvious reasons, this article does not seek to travel in that direction.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead, the process of comparing the exemplar design to the
TRIZ trends continues with the geometric evolution trend shown in Figure 5.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is perhaps one of the more obvious trends; one in which
benefits increase as a design exploits all of the available degrees of freedom.
This is a particularly important trend in the context of many manufactured
products; especially in examining the potential for evolution from the 2D to
fully 3D stage, where, historically, it has been easier to manufacture things
using 2D machining operations and consequently one of the available degrees of
freedom has not been exploited. The increasing availability of machining
capabilities where the difference in cost between 2D and 3D is zero means that
the untapped benefits to be had by utilising the third dimension can be accrued
without increased cost (i.e. the cost-benefit contradiction has been resolved by
better manufacturing technology).</p>
<font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><img SRC="Image37.gif" width="400" height="78"></font></p>
<p align="left">Figure 5: Geometric Evolution Trend.</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the case of the exemplar bearing, although the roller
profile has taken advantage of some degree of three-dimensionality, the
invention disclosure talks specifically about symmetrical designs and hence in
TRIZ trend terms the third dimension has not been fully exploited. Several other
areas where the third dimension has not been fully used may be seen - for
example the profile of the inner and outer races, and the end planes of the
bearing - and as such, the evolutionary potential plot should show that only
three out of the four evolution stages have been exploited.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A close relative of the space segmentation and geometric
evolution trends is the surface segmentation trend illustrated in Figure 6. This
trend defines increasing benefits to be gained by evolving smooth surfaces into
2D and 3D surfaces. As with the space segmentation trend, the bearing under
evaluation does not make use of any of the predicted evolutionary steps beyond
the first; it thus has significant untapped surface segmentation evolutionary
potential.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The controllability trend illustrated in Figure 7 is highly
relevant in a bearing design context. The trend is specifically interesting here
in terms of the use or otherwise of feedback in a system. It suggests the
questions �does the bearing design contain feedback, and what might the
potential benefits of incorporating feedback be?� In answer to the first
question, the exemplar bearing (and most other bearing designs) do not feature
any form of feedback. Possible advantages of integrating some form of feedback
into the system might then include various options for monitoring the health of
the bearing, for measuring loads, or for allowing optimisation of the operation
of the bearing based on varying operating conditions.</p>

<font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 6: Surface Segmentation Trend.</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="1"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While all of these potential benefits are speculative, it is
clear that the 6,296,395 bearing design - like the majority of other mechanical
designs has significant untapped evolutionary potential in this area. Most
likely this is due to some of the difficulties and likely complexity of
achieving feedback in mechanical systems (TRIZ would encourage designers to
identify existing resources within the system to help deliver the required
function without complicating the system). It may be observed that magnetic or
other �field-based� bearings do not carry such difficulties - and in fact
�controllability� is one of the main benefits offered by evolution to such
bearing design paradigms.</p>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><img SRC="Image39.gif" width="400" height="78"></font></p>
<font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 7: Controllability Trend.</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="1"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lack of space dictates the absence of the details of the
evolutionary potential analysis for the other trends in the TRIZ set. Instead,
Figure 8 illustrates the end result of the comparisons between the other most
relevant TRIZ trends and the 6,296,395 design. The figure thus acts as an
example of the sort of analysis that can and increasingly is being conducted for
other systems. For the design under evaluation, the plot clearly shows there to
be considerable amounts of untapped potential in the design, and therefore that
there are consequently significant improvements that we be developed.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Note: The bearing has been placed close to the end of the
reducing energy conversion trend as the only �energy conversions� in the system
are heat generation. The point on the radar plot denotes the level of
�inefficiency� or heat loss from the system.) </p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should also be noted at this point that while this plot
has been drawn for the bearing as a whole, it is often the case that the
analysis is conducted at the level of individual components in order to define a
hierarchy of evolutionary plots. This idea is illustrated in Figure 9 - which
shows how a composite radar plot from the bearing can be complemented by
equivalent plots for each of the components contained in the overall assembly.
Such plot families offer significant potential in terms of identifying areas to
focus R&amp;D efforts - for example there will be little point in devoting resources
to developing a component with little remaining evolutionary potential when
there are other components which are still at the un-evolved stages of several
of the TRIZ trends.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 9: Radar Plot Hierarchy for Exemplar Bearing</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This hierarchical radar plot model can of course be
extrapolated to also look at the bigger system within which the bearing is just
a small part.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1 Interaction Between Trends</p>
</b><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the important characteristics to pay attention to when
constructing these radar plots is the type and sequence of the trends around the
plot. In line with the importance of multi-dimensional thinking within the
overall TRIZ framework, it is useful to characterise the uncovered trends of
evolution into three main areas - one concerned with physical and spatial
characteristics; another concerned with temporal characteristics, and a third
concerning interfacial characteristics [3]. The division of the different trends
into these space, time and interface categories is illustrated in Figure 10.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Descriptions of each of the trends, along with examples, may
be found in [3]. For any component within a system, it is usual to make
comparisons with all of the trend possibilities in order to identify the ones
that are most relevant (the �reducing energy conversions� trend, for example -
which states that systems evolve in the direction of using progressively fewer
energy conversions - was deemed irrelevant in this particular case because the
only energy conversion associated with the bearing concerns heat generation due
to inefficiencies in the system.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the issues relating to application of the technology
trends involves combination effects. There are two main situations of note in
this regard; the first involves situations where evolution of a component along
one trend influences evolution along another, while the second involves
instances where the evolution of one component influences the evolution of other
surrounding components.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An example of the first case relevant to the bearing system
might involve the trend towards decreasing density in systems - which states
that the materials used to construct systems will gradually evolve in a
decreasing density direction. There are already bearing systems using ceramic
balls, for example. A potentially novel interaction between this trend and, say,
the trend towards increasing asymmetry (�systems will evolve in the direction of
matching to suit external asymmetries�), which is unlikely to have emerged by
examination of any of the trends on an individual basis, is to place one or two
ceramic balls into an otherwise symmetrical arrangement of all steel balls. The
general phenomenon with all of the trends is that benefits increase as a
component or system evolves along the trend. The anticipated benefit in this
instance would be that the (harder) ceramic ball �repairs� the bearing races by
rolling out any dents and holes that might form over time. Taking the asymmetry
trend a little further, it might be further possible to replace more of the
normal balls with ones that perform additional useful functions - e.g. (in
conjunction with the controllability trend or �colour interaction� trend) a
�marker� ball that changes colour when it wears, or a �cleaner� ball (possibly
dimpled - see surface segmentation trend) that clears foreign matter out of the
path of other balls.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 10: Spectrum of Technology Trends Divided into Space,
Time and Interface Categories [3].</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to the second trend combination idea - that
where the evolution of one component affects the evolution of another - a simple
example of this in action in the bearing design might be a combination of the
Geometric Evolution trend (Figure 6) applied to the shaft being supported by the
bearing - for example the addition of a local conical feature - which would then
influence the design of the ball bearing to take advantage of the load
distribution and load control potential that such a change potentially allows.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In essence, although the concept of evolutionary potential
may be seen to be relatively simple, using the mapping process outlined in
Figure 9, it is possible to generate an evolution picture which quite rapidly
becomes highly complex. This is in keeping with the (hopefully not surprising)
knowledge that the TRIZ trends exist to provide structure to evolution thinking,
and not an automatic inventing algorithm.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<font size="2"></font><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3 MATERIAL SYSTEM DESIGN</p>
</b><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The evolutionary potential concept works at all of the
different hierarchical levels at which a system may be observed. In the previous
example, the concept was applied to a complex sub-system of a bigger system. The
same ideas may be applied to that bigger system. Alternatively, as will be shown
here, the concept can also be applied when a much detailed focus perspective is
taken. </p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The exemplar system considered in this instance is US patent
4,174,358 granted to DuPont. A more comprehensive evolutionary potential radar
plot for this tough thermoplastic nylon composition is presented in Figure 11.
The analysis from which this plot was constructed used the relevant trends from
the 35 described in [3]. This example is being used in order to first show that
the number of trends detailed in the plot can vary considerably from one
application to the next, despite the fact that the menu of possible trend
options remains constant. Although this patent dates back to 1979, and many in
the industry might state that the patent represents a significant step in
bringing the industry to maturity, the plot suggests that there is still much
potential remaining in the deign.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The plot is also used as an example of how the footprint
described by the plot can serve to influence the future evolution direction of
the DuPont patent, or any system under consideration. This can be done on
several levels. Firstly, using the overall footprint it is possible to quickly
identify areas where the invention is strong (points where the system is at the
outer perimeter of the evolutionary potential map) and also where it is weak.
Looking then at a slightly more detailed level by splitting the image into the
three main space, time and interface categories, it is then possible to identify
whether there is any bias between these three categories.</p>

</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Figure 12 shows how the invention separates into those three
categories. What the plot shows in this instance is that all three have their
strengths and weaknesses. For the purposes of illustrating how the plots can be
used to generate ideas for improved products, the under-exploited elements of
the �interface� and �space� evolutionary potential categories will be examined
in more detail.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to examine some of the potential evolutionary
improvement opportunities that might arise from utilising this under-exploited
potential, some of the trend contained in this category will be examined in a
little more detail.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first of the trends that might be useful in thinking
about evolving the 4,174,358 design is the �Use of Colour� trend illustrated in
Figure 13. This is a trend which has only recently emerged from the research
undertaken during the preparation of [3]. The trend describes how systems evolve
from not using colour as a resource (which is the case for the material system
at hand - where it is usually left to the customer of the material to take
responsibility for its ultimate appearance), to making binary, visible-spectrum
and, ultimately, full spectrum use of colour. This trend, like the other 34
highlighted in Figure 10, can be used as a means of focusing thinking about
evolving the product at hand. The questions that are supposed to be prompted by
this particular trend are �what advantages might there be in using two colours
in this system?�, �what advantages are there in using all colours?�</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this point, the radar plot and the trends have done all
that they are able, and it is up to the skills of the designer to translate
these generic solution directions into things that might generate a more
beneficial product. While it is clearly not the intention of this article to
generate new intellectual property, some of the possibilities suggested by the
�use of colour� evolution direction might be:-</p>

  <li>

</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Basically, the possibilities are limited at this point in the
process by the imagination of the user. A second example of an under-exploited
trend in the existing patent comes with in the �space� category with the �webs
and fibres� trend. This trend is illustrated in Figure 14.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 14: �Webs and Fibres� Evolution Trend</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like the other possible trends, this one too can be applied
at a variety of different levels - from the micro-scale (where the connections
between the different molecules making up the polymer chain could be
considered), at the material level (where the polymer chains making up the
material are considered), or at what TRIZ would describe as the �super-system�
level - where the interest would be in how the material interacts with the
materials and components in contact with the material. In the first two of these
situations, the trend is pointing in the direction of increasingly 3-dimensional
polymer architectures (integration with the Mono-Bi-Poly trend would further
imply �fibres-on-fibres� for examples - like in a fractal geometry). The final
�active� trend stage suggests some of the ideas derived during the �use of
colour� trend discussion, but might also include such things as:-</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">self-repairing features</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">rheopectic features - enabling the stiffness of the
  material to vary under different load conditions</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">addition of �hooks� (possibly at the molecular level) to
  facilitate joining/separation of different components made of the material</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">etc.</li>
</ul>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again, the trends are used merely to provide structure to the
design evolution process. The specific solutions that may be generated by using
the trends will depend on the imaginative skills of the inventive problem solver
and the connections they can make between the evolution directions suggested by
the trends and the benefits that may be presented to customers as a result.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4 EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL IN A BUSINESS CONTEXT </p>
<font SIZE="1"></font></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The evolutionary potential concept applied in a business
setting is emerging as a very powerful indicator to help organisations know when
systems are beginning to hit fundamental limits, and where there are
opportunities to generate new improvements. This section is about applying the
same techniques to business using the business trends uncovered in TRIZ for
Business research [6].</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In essence, the evolutionary potential concept for business
works exactly the same as that for technical systems; in that the user is
required to compare the current business situation with each of the known
business trends in turn in order to establish a) whether the trend is relevant
(note: they won�t all be relevant to a given situation, but at least the
question should be asked), and b) how far along the trend the current system is.
Figure 15 illustrates an example for the business variant of the
�controllability� trend previously seen in Figure 7.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font><font SIZE="2"><b>

Evolutionary Potential Implications</p>

<p align="left">(NB: Numerical scale is arbitrary) </p>
</font><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A system receives a score relative to its position along the
trend, such that, for example, a system in which feedback is being used would
score a 0.66.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Construction of an evolutionary potential plot for the system
involves repeating this scoring process for each of the trends relevant in a
business context. As with the radar plots drawn for technical systems, the
evolutionary potential radar pictures offer an instant snapshot of where a
system currently is and where it has unused potential to jump to higher levels
of capability - as have been found by someone somewhere amongst the range of
published business solutions from around the world. Figure 16 illustrates a
hypothetical example. For the purpose of clarity, not all of the trends have
been included.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 16: Evolutionary Potential Radar Plot for a
Hypothetical Business System</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The solid area in the plot is intended to represent the
current state of the system under evaluation, while the white area to the
perimeter of the plot represents potential that the system has not yet taken
advantage of.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In line with the importance of space, time and interface
awareness within TRIZ, Figure 17 illustrates the list of business trends thus
far uncovered segmented into each of these three categories.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the trends - such as �segmentation� and
�Mono-Bi-Poly� - have relevance in each of the three categories and so are
repeated for each in order to ensure that they are examined in each appropriate
context. At this moment in time, 23 different trends have been uncovered, which
then becomes 31 when the different interpretations in the space, time and
interface categories are included.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to maintain a degree of consistency between
different plots it is usually a good idea to maintain the sequence of the three
categories when constructing the plots.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 17: Business Trends Divided into Space, Time and
Interface Categories</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of these trends - like the �controllability� trend
illustrated in its two forms in Figures 7 and 15 - have their roots in the
trends originally uncovered for technical systems. Some like �customer
expectation� - illustrated in Figure 18 - on the other hand have their roots in
the findings of more business-focused researchers [7]. </p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main point with this and other trends, in common with the
overall TRIZ philosophy, is the appropriate location and distillation of
excellence in whatever form it may be found.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with the equivalent plots for technical systems, the radar
plot concept is extendable to examine different parts of a system. This is most
likely to offer benefit when plots are drawn for the different sub-systems that
make up an overall system - for example for departments or profit centres within
an organisation. A hypothetical example is illustrated in Figure 19.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Early experience suggests that this kind of organisational
evolution snap-shot can be constructed in a relatively short period of time by a
small group without prior knowledge of TRIZ or the trends.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE IMPLICATIONS</p>
</b><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The research conducted for this article concludes that both
of the systems considered, although perhaps thought of as �mature� technologies,
have considerable levels of untapped evolutionary potential remaining, and that
there are consequently significant opportunities for development of both large
quantities of intellectual property and improved performance benefits to
customers.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ideal Final Result strategy contained within TRIZ,
however, highlights a possible danger. Most companies are happier - and local
operating constraints often dictate - working left-to-right, starting with an
existing system and evolving it through �continuous improvement. This is fine
until someone - usually someone from outside the industry based on historical
analysis [5] - works out that the road to ideality is better travelled starting
from IFR and working back. The evolutionary limits of an existing system may be
some considerable distance away from the IFR for that system. While the
evolutionary potential concept is important in terms of improving existing
products, it is no substitute for an IFR start position in the large majority of
instances.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ also shows that sub-systems and components like
bearings, materials, etc often achieve ideality (i.e. delivering the function
without the system existing) by having something else higher up the overall
system hierarchy perform the function. This is usually the direction from which
the main threat to a sub-system comes. Organisations need to obtain a much more
holistic view of the places of their products, processes and services in the
bigger scheme of things if they are to have a chance of countering the threats
from other, higher level systems.</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The �evolutionary potential� concept, meanwhile, appears to
offer benefits to users in terms of offering better understanding of how well a
system is evolved, where to focus future R&amp;D efforts (there being little
advantage, for example, in devoting resources to improvement of aspects that are
already at their evolutionary limits), and how close to ideality it will
ultimately be able to evolve. </p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next part of the process involve understanding innovation
timing - answering the �when?� questions. This is a subject discussed in more
detail in [3], and one that will be revisited future case study examples.</p>
