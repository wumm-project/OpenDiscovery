<p>ABSTRACT</p>
</b></font>
<p>Two methods of modeling a system's functionality are widely used<font COLOR="#ff0000">
</font>in TRIZ applications for problem solving, system simplification, and
improvement. Both these methods are distinct from classical Substance Field
(Su-Field) modeling. (Ref. 1) Subject - Action (verb) - Object models are based
on very specific tangible physical components of a system and the explicit
(physical) effects they exert on other components of the system. &quot;Operational&quot;
models, generally known as &quot;problem formulator&quot; models, allow broader definition
of a system's elements to include actions as well as components. These models
focus on whether those elements ultimately contribute Useful or Harmful effects
to the primary purpose of the system or elements supporting that purpose. (Ref.
2)</p>
<p>An additional modeling approach, Causal Loop models derived from the Systems
Thinking discipline, may also serve the TRIZ practioner by helping to identify
those system elements and /or actions in a system that are most pertinent to
causing a desired change in performance.</p>
<p>The results of applying these three functional modeling and analysis methods
to several modern agricultural problems will be presented. The process example
addresses cropping procedures and potential education programs for farming,
while the implement example involves product design issues.</p>

<p>Air Seeding in No-Till Farming</p>

<p>No-till agriculture differs from conventional farm practices by leaving the
soil undisturbed after the harvest. (Picture 1 of standing stubble.) In the
spring, seed is planted directly in the un-disturbed field, and is protected by
the duff from the previous crop. (Picture 2.)</p>

<p>No-till agriculture is good because it keeps water and CO2 in the soil,
reduces the amount of fertilizer needed, reduces the amount of fuel used to
process the fields, reduces labor of farmers, and reduces wear and tear on the
machinery. No-till farming is now done on almost 20% of U. S. farmland and may
be even more in Canada. (Refs. 3, 4)</p>
<p>But, No-till requires specialized tools to plant the seeds, place the
fertilizer, and condition the soil for germination and growth. (See web sites,
Refs. 5, 6)</p>
<p>A common device to perform combined seeding and fertilizer application is the
air seeder. The principles of operation of the air seeder are quite simple: Seed
and / or fertilizer are carried by air through tubes and dropped into an opening
in the ground. In practice, the devices become quite complex. </p>

<p>A frame, to be pulled by a tractor, has folding �wings� to allow transport
and storage. The frame has multiple tired wheels to carry its weight. Dimensions
vary among models, but may be 30 to 50 feet wide. The frame may also carry one
or more bins. The frame carries seed and fertilizer distribution tubing, and
provides for the mounting of multiple soil openers and multiple specialized
roller wheels to pack the soil after delivery.</p>

</font>
<p>Seed and fertilizer bins are carried on a separate cart. The cart has tired
wheels to carry its weight and to obtain motive power for the mechanisms carried
on the cart. The wheels provide driving force for multiple sets of adjustable
sprocket drive systems which meter materials out of the bins and into a complex
of distribution tubing. Air is blown through the distribution tubing to carry
the seed and fertilizer. At points where the material being delivered is
required to divide into multiple pathways, the air supply tubes are fitted with
flat impingement plates, with numerous smaller tubes providing exit pathways.</p>

<p>The small tubes eventually bring the materials to multiple soil openers.
These are mounted on the frame with penetration depth adjustments and with a
retraction mechanism for transport between fields. A typical air seeder may
carry 40 to 60 or more openers. Openers are removable / replaceable, and several
types are available. </p>

<p>Design of these agricultural tools is evolving rapidly. This would be a
�fertile� area for a technology evolution/TRIZ problem solving study-you can
easily see the progression from point to line to area to volume tools, from
simple mechanisms to highly flexible mechanisms, from muscle power to mechanical
power to pneumatic/hydraulic systems. </p>
<p>But, these are highly complex, extremely expensive systems that can be set up
to do one thing very well, but may take a lot of time to reconfigure to do
something else, such as using a different ratio of seed to fertilizer, or
changing the separation of seed and fertilizer, etc. Changes in field conditions
occur frequently, over short distance, and optimum seed/fertilizer relationships
should change to match the field conditions for maximum harvest. (Ref. 7)</p>

<p>For the purpose of testing three function modeling methods, we will limit the
discussion to the improvement of the speed of changing only one of these
parameters. Changing the ratio of seed and fertilizer is the primary problem
that will be used for this example, but both problems are of great interest in
the no-till farming equipment industry.</p>

<p>THE SYSTEM MODELS</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p>Conventional TRIZ Functional Modeling Analysis</p>
</b></font>
<p>The same No-till Airseeding situation is described below using each of the
modeling systems. A �formulator� model for air seeding is shown in Figure 1.
This method is described in Ref. 8 and has been popularized by Ideation
International�s Ideation Workbench � software. Each box represents either a
useful or harmful function, and the arrows between boxes show relationships-one
function can cause or prevent another. A large number of potential problem
statements are generated from this model by substitution in general formulas
such as the following:</p>
<font COLOR="#0000ff">
    </font>
</p><ul>
  <li>Find a way to enhance the useful effect</li>
  <li>Find a way to remove, reduce, or prevent a harmful effect
    without losing the useful effect that is generated by the same process.</li>
  <li>Find an alternate way to create a useful effect</li>
  <li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The TRIZ practioner has to examine the list of potential problem statements,
select the ones that are most appropriate for the situation, and then re-express
them in terms of the language of the situation in order to begin solving the
problem.</p>

</font><font FACE="Arial">Diagram of the model for the airseeder, using the

functions.</p>
</font></b>
<p>The function analysis model is based on system engineering methods of
defining a function in terms of two objects and the action that one performs on
the other. (Ref. 9) The graphical form of function analysis has been popularized
in TRIZ through Invention Machine Co.�s TechOptimizer� as shown in Fig. 2. This
method is now also used in CREAX�s CreaTRIZ<font FACE="Symbol">�</font>
Software. Solid arrows indicate useful functions, dashed arrows indicate useful
functions that are not operating at their best value (either too much or too
little) and wavy arrows indicate harmful functions. Problem statements are
developed directly from the graphics by examination, for example:</p>
<dir>
  <li>Eliminate harmful functions</li>
  <li>Improve inadequate functions</li>
  <li>Find an alternate way to do beneficial functions.</li>
</dir>
<p>Problem statements are also developed through the process of trimming, such
as </p>
<dir>
  <li>Delete functions. How can the useful function be performed
    without another function? Or can the result be achieved without the
    function?</li>
  <li>Delete components. How can the function be transferred to other
    components? Or to resources of the system?</li>
</dir>
<p>Finally, problem statements are developed by applying a list of generic
problem statements, based on the 76 standard solutions (Ref. 10) to the function
statement. </p>

<p>Using the Causal Loop modeling system </p>
</font></b><font FACE="Arial" COLOR="#ff0000">
</font>
<p>The causal loop model is shown in Figure 3a. This methodology is based on the
Systems Thinking Discipline developed and popularized by Peter Senge. (Refs. 11,
12) One automated version of this modeling method, the I-Think Software by High
Performance Systems, is described in Reference 13, and is among several software
products available (Ref 14). The modeling method utilizes a nouns and verbs<font FACE="Arial">
</font>representation of the elements of a system. Nouns, represented by
rectangles, are amounts, quantities, accumulations, things, states of being, or
levels, etc. The verbs are activities that cause change, either positive or
negative, in the magnitude of the nouns. Verbs are shown as directional pipes or
flows, with regulators. (Ref. 15)</p>
<p>Three additional graphic elements are useful in representing causal link
model elements. First is the cloud, which can serve as an infinite source or
sink for the noun elements. This allows models to be bounded for practicality,
and allows a focus on sub-systems of particular interest. The second additional
element is an action connector, shown as a solid curvilinear arrowed line, to
show causal linkages, inputs or outputs, between model elements.</p>
<p>The final graphic element is a converter, or circle. Converters serve to
input parametric values, to link or combine information, and to modify flows.

<p>Analysis</p>
</b></font>
<p>All three models gave the same suggestions for the problems to be solved to
improve the airseeder, but the models required the user to take significantly
different pathways to develop that set of tasks or suggestions. </p>
<p>Specifically, for the function analysis model, problem statements involving
use of the supersystem came only from repeated use of trimming. If the user did
not try trimming repeatedly for each new development of the model, he might not
see the opportunities for solving the problem using the supersystem. Combining
the function analysis model with the use of the system operator (9 Windows)
(Ref. 16) would overcome this problem, although it would add somewhat to the
complexity of using the function analysis model. The formulator model made these
solutions very visible, but very abstract.</p>
<p>The use of resources is a very powerful TRIZ technique. Both the graphical
function analysis model and the formulator model only generate tasks for the
resources that are explicitly named in the model. Resources that are idle in the
initial conditions of the problem are not specifically suggested for tasks,
except in the table form of function analysis and in the detailed suggestions
section of the formulator model. </p>
<p>Causal Loop models make it very clear that time dimension must be considered
and that the nature of the problem may be different in different episodes. Time
is considered as part of the zone of conflict analysis in classical TRIZ, but is
not explicitly treated in any of the function analysis approaches. One Time span
of interest is when things are flowing out of storage, mixing, going into the
ground. Another time span of interest (level of system interest) is the ensemble
of openers being pulled across the field, and the field being seeded at the
right density and right depth. This is a 9 Windows issue-component, supersystem
and system all produce different questions.</p>
<p>Causal loop modeling helps find harmful issues (what goes out of control
when?). It also lets you explore the nature and intensity of interactions. For
example, the system may need an alarm or a stop when either fertilizer or seed
runs out. The mechanisms may not be very necessary now with fixed settings, but
would be more needed with an automated or self-adjusting system, since
predictability of running out is lower.</p>
<p>For experienced users, any �suggestion� by one system was also in the
�suggestions� from the other, BUT the paths were very different, and the
inspection/accept/reject process might have not gotten you there. </p>
<p>The three modeling systems are distinctly different in dealing with the
parameters of the<font COLOR="#0000ff"> </font>functions being modeled. In
descending order of detail, they are as follows: </p>
</p><ul>
  <li>The parameters enter explicitly into the control factors in the
    causal loop model, and are used to calculate the effects of operation.
    Sensitivity studies can guide prioritization of things to work on. </li>
  <li>Using the TechOptimizer� format for function analysis, the
    parameters that describe the actual and desired strength of a function, and
    a phrase describing the importance of the measured value can be associated
    with the function statement. Cost values for the components can also be
    entered, so that prioritization of improvement or of trimming can be
    calculated, based on the ideality equation, or on other value systems. </li>
  <li>Using the Ideation Workbench� format for the formulator,
    functions are only identified as useful or harmful, with no parameters.
    Prioritization is based on removing harmful functions first, and on the
    user�s judgment when inspecting the list of suggestions.</li>

<b><font FACE="Arial">
<p>Comparison issues for further discussion</p>
</font></b>
<p>Is Causal Loop modeling more like an animated Su-field model? The focus of
Causal Loop modeling is on identifying what are the opportunities for
improvement and for control, and then evaluating the effectiveness of those
approaches. Likewise, the Su-field is a way of recording a judgment. It reminds
us to look at tool, object, energy, transmission, and guidance in a system to
see if they are all there and working. </p>
<p>Formulator and Function Analysis are less structured, more preliminary
explorations of the situation environment. They provide for an initial
recognition of interactions and forced categorization of functionality as
useful, harmful, etc. </p>
<p>It appears that TRIZ functional modeling, with any of these tools, is
somewhat holographic in nature. If we create a model of part of a system of
interest to us, and utilize that model to explore ways to improve Ideality, we
may see suggested tasks or pathways of improvement that lead us outside the part
we have modeled. They may really address another part of the system or even the
super-system. </p>
<p>A potential application pathway for these tools might well be to first do
either a Formulator or Function Model analysis, then develop an animated Causal
Loop Model for interface with design or process development teams, and finally
to create Su-Field models of the specific elements of interest in the system.
</p>
<p>All of these modeling systems offer expandability. Given the ability to
incorporate time, either explicitly or implicitly, we could expand these models
to include seed and fertilizer procurement and delivery sub-systems, or
additional tractor and airseeder functionality.</p>
<p>In addition, these model systems are all amenable to �drilling down� through
greater detail of the entire model or a particular sub-system for either focus
or for added analysis of more specific functionality. The operational
characteristics and physical components of the openers, for example, is an area
of significant technical development and evolution. On-going design efforts here
might be aided by TRIZ functional analysis.</p>
<p>For the No-till case study system, another reasonable expansion of the scope
of the model might be to include the soil (both the physics and chemistry) as a
more detailed sub-system. We might also model the growth characteristics of the
plants, their genetics and nutrient requirements / responses.</p>
<p>A special case of model expansion is the ability to combine models of
different systems into a more complete model of a supersystem. An example would
be the combination of a model of the Flax residual straw case described above
with the airseeder model. Since the Flax straw if left on the ground could
become an impediment to proper opening of the ground during No-till planting, a
complete analysis might yield unexpected approaches to broader system
improvement. Preliminary formulator analysis of the standalone Flax residue
problem identified several approaches to system improvement. A specific
embodiment of one of those approaches is now in evaluation. </p>
<font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>
<p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
</b></font>
<p>Professor T. Ohfuji (Ref. 17), among others, has observed that product and /
or process functions are tasks which we have delegated to machines. Feature sets
are designed into machines to bring functions about. We are using the FA and
formulator models as �machines� to do the function of analysis but these
diagrams are static, and have forced us, in order to not see a static system, to
animate them in our imagination, and with our existing knowledge. We do �mental�
simulations in our heads when we see each box, each function, and see the time
of operation. Each graphic based system provides a framework for our mental
processing. The Causal Loop model does the processing for us, in a limited but
repeatable version. The Causal Loop modeling approach may help us observe and
recognize system functionality that we have not previously been aware of. It may
also cause us to realize the time dependency of many functions on each other.</p>
<p>A big benefit (no news here-many people have remarked on it) of any
functional modeling is that a project team creating the diagram together (any
diagram) are forced to document their understanding of the problem, and go do
root cause analysis (or go back to data gathering, or, or, or, �) if they can�t
agree on the nature of the functions or interactions. The depth and breadth of
understanding necessary for good design, or good problem solving, may require or
be aided by, the creation of multiple models. Using more that one different
modeling techniques may well be very cost effective, in today�s complex and time
compressed technical world.</p>
<font COLOR="#ff0000">
</font><font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p>Conclusion about inspection/sorting vs. creation of problem statements in
terms of maturity of TRIZ system.</p>
</b></font>
<p>The tools and techniques we use in TRIZ are still immature. Per Professor T.
Ohfuji�s observation, we have delegated the function of identifying problems and
/ or improvements to our analytical devices, but they do not work fully or
flawlessly. We have set (some of) these devices to give us lists of possible
actions, but we must still use our intellect and experience to decide which of
these are not nonsense by a process of inspection and sorting. We must also
still �animate� these models, either mentally or with computer simulation, and
judge the results against our experience base. Mature modeling systems will
perhaps be more powerful in their ability to highlight areas where performance
is inadequate, where a system is most sensitive to improved control, and where
system simplification may lead toward increased ideality. We hope these comments
are helpful in furthering the maturity of our discipline. </p>
