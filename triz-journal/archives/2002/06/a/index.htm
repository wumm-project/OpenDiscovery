  <p><font color="#008080">The original article, by Brian Campbell, was in the
  <a href="../../04/index.htm">April 2002</a> issue of The TRIZ Journal.
  Comments by several others appeared in the <a href="../../04/index.htm">April</a>
  and <a href="../../05/index.htm">May</a> issues.</font></p>
  <p>Ellen,</p>
  <p>First of all, thanks to you and Michael for you great work on the Journal.
  Keep it up.</p>
  <p>Second, to answer the question &quot;If TRIZ is so good..&quot;, it is the exact same
  question that has been vexing the Value Engineering community for years. Like
  TRIZ, VE is a proven, powerful way to solve problems and come up with
  innovative solutions. Although the TRIZ methodology delivers a higher level of
  innovation, these tools have the same aims. And the answer to the &quot;golden
  question&quot; is also the same - </p>
  <p>The reason why TRIZ (and VE) are hard to sell is that you are selling TRIZ
  (or VE). </p>
  <p>The grim reality of the business world is that we measure success in
  financial terms, not in terms of how clever our innovation is. Therefore,
  focusing on a methodology (however clever or potent) is irrelevant to the
  scorekeeping Of complete relevance is the business result that TRIZ or VE
  deliver. Selling this is much more interesting to those who keep score. </p>
