</font>
<p>Most general laws of the laws of dialectics are:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li><b>The Law of the Unity (Interpenetration) of Opposites;
  </b>
  <li><b>The Law of Transformation of Quantity into Quality;
  </b>
  <li><b>The Law of the Negation of the Negation</li>
</ul>
</b>
<p>These laws act in all fields of objective reality and thought, but their
development are different for each field. Therefore every new developing science
must lean on these laws.</p>

  <font size="2"><b>
  <p align="left">2. </b></font><font size="2">The Law of the Unity
  (Interpenetration) of Opposites</p>
</dir>
</font>
<p>The <b>Law of the Unity (Interpenetration) of Opposites</b> is the core of
dialectics. It serves as a source for creation of all objects including material
objects, where technical systems belong. The law defines one of the key TRIZ
concepts: <b>contradiction</b><sup><a name="3" href="#Footnotes">3</a></sup><b><a name="3"></a>.</p>
<p>Unity (Interpenetration) of Opposites</b> was introduced more then 5000 years
ago by ancient Chinese philosophers in their vision of the World image, which
include material and immaterial description. We will simplify this World image
for the discussion about Opposites.</p>
<p>The Chinese philosophers thought about universe as <b>Chi </b>energy, which
is mean for interaction between <b>world forces</b> of <b>Yin </b>and <b>Yang</b>.
</p>
<b>
<p>Yin force</b> symbolizes <b>Dark</b>, <b>Cold</b>, <b>Evil</b>, <b>Rest</b>;
it means all negative, bad, woman basis. </p>
<b>
<p>Yang force</b> symbolizes <b>Light, Warm, Good, Activity</b>; it means all
positive, good, man basis.</p>
<i>
<p>Forces of Yin</i> and <i>Yang</i> <b>interact, overcome and transform one to
another</b>.</p>
<p>One force grows in another force overcoming it till the final transformation
is done and then immediately there is the same motion in opposite direction.
This is an endless process, because there is eternal motion in the universe. </p>
<p>We can see the idea of eternal motion and struggle of opposites in graphic
image of <b>Yin </b>and <b>Yang</b> (<i>monad</i>), as <b>black</b> and <b>white
</b>parts of the circle in fig. 1. The <b>white part</b> symbolizes force <b>
Yang</b> and the <b>black part </b>symbolizes force <b>Yin</b>. The <b>little
black</b> circle on <b>white side</b> means that <b>Yang give birth to Yin</b>
and the <b>little white</b> circle on <b>black side</b> means that <b>Yin give
birth to Yang</b>. <b>Decrease of Yang part lead to increase of Yin part</b> as
we can see it in the bottom of the big circle and the contrary, <b>decrease of
Yin part lead to increase of Yang part</b> as we can see in top of the big
circle. </p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image19.gif" width="504" height="318"></p>
</font>
<p>This image shows interaction and struggle of the opposites. In the monad the
interaction and struggle of opposites in the system are in balance, cataclysms
are not occurred. We can say there is a balance in nature when there is no
storm, tornado, fire, flood, ecological disorder etc, or balance in society,
when there is no war, or balance in mechanism when it is without breakdown,
failure etc. In the state of balance the system functions in the most favorable
conditions without negative internal or external impacts. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With system�s one side change, there is system�s other side
change. Sometimes it causes the antagonisms. For example if we improve some
system�s parameter it make other parameter worse. The contradictive action or
quality can be born as a result of structural change.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same picture 1 shows the possibility of contradictive
qualities separation in space (Yin on the right side and Yang on the left side)
and in structure (the small part of Yin is inside of Yang and vice versa).
Moreover, space division can be done by any curve or surface. </p>
<dir>
  <font size="2"><b>
  <p align="left">3. </b></font><font size="2">Law of Transformation of
  Quantity into Quality<b> </p>
</dir>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <b>Law of Transformation of Quantity into Quality</b>
defines a general mechanism of evolution. Quantitative changes in a system take
place continuously accordingly the S-curve of evolution. When a certain limit of
quantitative evolution is reached, a system experiences qualitative changes. New
quality increases rate of growth. During this process, quantitative changes take
place continuously whereas qualitative changes take place in discrete steps. The
duration and character of the discrete step can differ: long and short,
impetuous and relatively calm and so on.</p>
<p>There are 4 growth stages to pass for any technical system. (see fig. 2) At
the beginning, the development is slow (stage I), at the certain point there is
an acceleration in development speed (stage II), after that the speed is slowing
down till the parameter�s growth of system is finished (stage III), this means
appearance of the contradictions. Sometimes the parameters begin to decrease; it
means the death of the current system (stage IV). The curves like these
so-called �line of life of a technical system�, usually called <b>S-curves.</b>
</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="d02.gif" width="400" height="358"></p>
</font>
<p>For technical system:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Stage I </b>- born of the system (idea and prototype)<br>
  <b>Stage II</b> - industrial manufacturing of the system and it development
  accordingly to market demands<br>
  <b>Stage III</b> - final touch of little improvements, the main parameters of
  the system doesn�t change, there is mostly the cosmetic changes (package and
  appearance) <br>
  <b>Stage IV</b> - worsening of certain system parameters, caused by:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>- economical, social or political situation influence, mode, religious
    limitation etc.<br>
    - physical and moral ageing of system usually in stage IV the system end it
    existence or become utilized </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>End of system growth doesn�t mean end of evolution in this field. The new
more advanced systems come to life, what means leap forward in evolution take
place. Further evolution of the system starts according to a new S-curve. This
is a typical example of Law of Transformation of Quantity into Quality. Such a
process we can see in picture 3. <b>System 2 </b>appears instead of <b>system 1</b>.
The leap forward in evolution continues, in the same way appears <b>system 3 </b>
after it <b>system 4 </b>and so on. The whole progress in the field can be seen
as a tangent to the S-curves (dashed line in picture 4) so-called <b>envelope
curve</b>.</p>
<p>Development of any kind of technology can be an example for the support of
this law. Let�s see the shipbuilding technology.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="d04.gif" width="500" height="225"></p>
</font>
<blockquote>
  <p>Example 1: Suppose the speed of the ship will be the <b>P parameter</b>.
  The speed growth of <b>rowing boat </b>was done by increase in number of oars,
  but it couldn�t exceed the 7-8 miles.</p>
  <p>Leap forward in evolution - appearance of <b>sailing vessel</b>. Speed
  growth there was done by increase of overall sail�s square, but it couldn�t
  exceed the 12-13 miles. That wasn�t enough; there was a need to increase the
  speed without dependence in speed and direction of the wind. Therefore:</p>
  <p>Next leap forward in evolution - <b>ships with engine</b>. The speed growth
  of ships with engine was done by increase the power density of the engine.</p>
  <p>The next leap was the displacement of tonnage part of the ship out of
  water. This causes the <b>ships with underwater wings</b>. After that was
  needed to decrease water resistance to these wings - appeared ships on air
  cushion. More decrease in water resistance to <b>ship lead to airfoil boat</b>.</p>
  <p>Example 2. <b>Rowing boat</b>. The overall tendency of rowing boat
  development is given in fig. 5. </p>

</font>
<dir>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the beginning was only one oar. Then was the incensement
  in number of oars. At the beginning there was only one tier. The incensement
  in number of oars led to reorganization it to two, three and even five tiers
  of oarsman. </p>
</dir>
<blockquote>
  <p>Example 3. <b>Sailing vessel</b>. The overall tendency of sailing vessel
  development is given in picture 6. At the beginning was only one sail on mast.
  After that was the incensement in number of sails and masts. </p>
</blockquote>
<font SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image21.gif" width="511" height="219"></p>
</font>
<dir>
  <p>Example 4. The speed growth of ships and the need of independence from wind
  led to next leap forward in evolution - appearance of engine ship. The speed
  growth in this kind of ships was done by perfection of engine and replacement
  to more power density types. First of all there was a steam engine, after that
  diesel, then steam or gas turbine and finally nuclear plant.</p>
  <p>Example 5. The next leap was the displacement of tonnage part of the ship
  out of water. This causes the <b>ships with underwater wings</b>. </p>
  <p>Example 6. After that was needed to decrease water resistance to these
  wings - appeared <b>ships on air cushion</b>.</p>
  <p>Example 7. Finally, more decrease in water resistance to ship lead to
  airfoil boat (fig. 7). This kind of ships is alike airplane, flying above the
  water, using shadow effect supporting the ship. It can carry load much more
  then the airplane. </p>

<p align="left"><img border="0" src="d05.jpg" width="500" height="259"></p>
<p></font>In the phase of problem choice and for system evolution forecasting
there is a need of taking into account the <b>Law of Transformation of Quantity
into Quality. </b>To imagine a full diagram of evolution of technical systems,
it is necessary to take into account a so-called �line of life� of a technical
system<sup><a name="4" href="#Footnotes">4</a><a name="4"></a></sup>, a
regularity defined by Genrich Altshuller.</p>
<dir>
  <font size="2"><b>
  <p align="left">4. </b></font><font size="2">Law of the Negation of the
  Negation</p>
</dir>
</font>
<p>An essence of the <b>Law of the Negation of the Negation</b> is that a
process of progressive evolution consists of a series of relative repetitions,
as if going through the same phases again and again. However, each repetition
takes place at a higher level of evolution by using new elements, materials, and
technologies. We can say, that in this case we have a spiral-shaped evolution.
For example, fashion design is the most obvious example of spiral-shaped
evolution.</p>
<p>Let�s see a couple of examples.</p>
<dir>
  <p>Example 9. In XIX century, the use of sail-screw ship engine was in the
  calm only. For elimination of propeller screw resistance to water in sailing,
  the propeller screw was detachable and it was lifted up to deck through stern
  shaft. (fig. 8). Power-plant perfection enabled to get rid of sails. The need
  of screw lifting was no longer relevant, as well as the stern shaft above the
  screw and it was no longer manufactured this way. In XX century, detachable
  blade became a feature of big propeller screw and cause the need of stern
  shaft. In 1968 for improvement of maintainability condition, mounted stern
  shaft above the screw for lifting repairable vane was offered again by UK
  patent. </p>
</dir>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image17.gif" width="206" height="114"></p>
</font>
<p>Denmark engineers did another solution for engine-sail carriers and
fishing-boats of this problem. During the sailing the screw turn out like an
accordion automatically and do not resist to the water. As soon as the speed of
the ship decreased the propeller blades become ready to work and the engine turn
on at the same time. These kinds of ships are 10% faster then the usual kind.
</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image18.gif" width="329" height="245"></p>
</font>
<p>Example 10. With steamer appearance the role of sail ship decreased, today
use of sails are mostly in small fishing-boats, sport and learn ships. But
Hamburg Shipbuilding Institute developed commercial sailing ship. (see fig. 9).
The sails are much alike the vertical standing of airplane wings. The masts turn
around and place the sails in the most favorable angle to the wind. The
efficiency of these sails is 1.5 time better then traditional ones. The
principle of putting on and off the sails is like the theatre tableau curtains.
The sails system allows using even very small flaw. In case of calm, there is a
need for utilization of low-powered engine, which is managing the sails during
the wind weather too. There is also the computer for meteorological data
analysis and optimal course recommendations. This kind of ship can develop the
speed of 12-20 miles, depending on the wind. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Energy crisis conditions sails compete successfully
with any oil engine. The developers think that capacious sailing ship can be
more efficient then nuclear plant ship.</p>
