<p>Abstract</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ is a structured thinking process. We take information,
we create models of that information, we assess those models against other
models of other systems, we propose alternative models of systems and we test
those models against other models. Embedded in that series of operations are
some fundamental scientific models of the physical world, some fundamental laws
of different kinds, some mathematical models suggesting ranges of operational
interactions and some analogies between systems which can be fairly firm of
fairly loose.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each of these operations requires some mental processing by
the brain machine and the latest neuroscience suggests our traditional model of
how this machine works needs rethinking. The models in our heads, of the world
outside, are of many different kinds and exist in different places. Our ability
to <i><b>select</b></i> and <i><b>evaluate</b></i> <i><b>our thinking</b></i>,
to take control of what we are pursuing in thought, is less than we had
imagined.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This paper looks at some fundamental thinking operations in
the light of the latest neuroscience and examines how this might help us think
about what is happening as we apply TRIZ to design and problem solving.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. The brain</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The latest machines for investigating what is going on in our
heads, when we think, are giving us new ways of thinking about thinking.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first thing to be remodelled is the idea that our sense
of the world as vision, hearing, taste, touch and smell is nicely located in
particular places. There is so much cross-fertilization between the different
sensory maps that it is perfectly reasonable to say you also see with your
fingers and hear with your eyes!</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But things out there do not just have sensory attributes;
they have functional, linguistic, emotive and event memory attributes. So my
kitchen table is a place for preparing food, for talking with people over a
glass of wine, for standing on to do the decorating, and may even trigger
memories of my parents or grandparents. Any one or more of these attributes
being triggered by something else may lead me to see/hear/feel/smell and maybe
even taste my kitchen table in that the primary sense maps will be triggered to
some degree.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The more familiar I am with anything, the more these
interactive patterns will be loaded in my brain system. The more patterns that
are loaded the harder it is for me to change how I think/feel/think about what I
have in front of me. You have most control when you know least.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Basic neuroscience is telling us loud and clear that the more
you are an expert in your field the more you will have trouble thinking about
what is going on in a new way! But we knew that didn’t we?</p>
<b>
<p>2. Communication</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we want to create something we will probably need to
communicate with other people, to share our intentions, to plan actions, to
check our thoughts, to ask for information. We have known for a long time that
communication is a pretty difficult thing to get right, but now from the
neuroscience we can see why. When I talk about a table it is a very different
table from the one you have in your head. It has a host of different attributes
and connections which we could spend months trying to check and double check.
These differences are important for two quite distinct reasons.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first is the logical/functional/scientific difference, so
that when I see my table in my head I may see something which has functionality
because of its flexibility (made of wood) warmth, and strength (being a
sculptor) whereas you may “see” its functionality as weight, surface weakness,
non-malleability (being a production engineer). We may regard each other and
ourselves as very professional people but our models of what we have may be very
different, even on the most fundamental issues of functionality of design. Our
brains will be wired differently because we have a different history leading up
to our separate wirings.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second difference is the affective rather than effective
dimension! If our scientific models are different, that is nothing compared to
how different our emotive connections will be to different things. In deep
memory there will be primary value attributes connected to so many things we
have around us. At the emotive level, a sharp knife to a whittler of wood will
be very different to a sharp knife in a kitchen for a parent of young children.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All this is true when we talk to each other about what we
know. When we talk about what we don’t know, or imagine how things might be
created which are different, the tendency to move off down separate paths will
be very great, simply because when we move away from the more immediate tangible
things around us, the push and pull between ideas will be driven by all these
other connecting systems and they will be so different between different people.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. Inventing</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we want to invent, or simply solve problem with our
current inventions, we can go through the sequence of steps that will be
familiar to most people. We can take the steps:</p>
<dl>
  <dd>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is it we want to do?</dd>
  <dd>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What ideas do we have about how to do it?</dd>
  <dd>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What do we value about these different ideas?</dd>
  <dd>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Which ideas shall we select to work on?</dd>
  <dd>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What other problems do we have to solve to make these ideas
  work?</dd>
  <dd>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How do we solve these other problems?</dd>
  <dd>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Have we a plan?</dd>
  <dd>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does it make sense?</dd>
  <dd>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And shall we do it?</dd>
</dl>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Different process models may play with these steps in
different orders and with some loops back and forth. If we think about these
steps in relation to our more complex view of what is happening in our heads we
can see that things are likely to get very messy very quickly. We might, after a
little bit of discussion, all agree on what we want to do. But this agreement
may hide a host of different perceptions people have about what is wanted. The
team leader, though without this being conscious, may “want” to do something
because it was an idea she had when she was 8 and talking to her father who
really liked the idea! The research physicist may really “want” to do it because
it will require thinking about a bit of physics that he has wanted to explore
for many years but never had the right project to work on! None of these reasons
for wanting to do something may be apparent and even with questioning may be
hard to elicit. Just as, when you look at your kitchen table, it is not easy to
sense that you feel it as well as see it, so when you feel you like an idea
about what to do it may be very difficult to tap into why, where the drive comes
from.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may not seem to matter much, in the early stages, why you
want to do something, because surely, you have all agreed on what you want to
do? But in practice, it does matter a lot. Because when you start generating
ideas about how to do something, and selecting which approaches you want to
pursue, the different primary reasons for doing it will emerge. Suddenly the
ideas being developed do not offer research into that key area of physics, or
the ideas have moved away from the original idea the team leader had with her
father all those years ago. The personal energy to pursue solutions comes from
the inner drives to seek those solutions. Take away this energy and the project
starts to founder. People lose interest. All because this is really how the
brain works. It is not a simple logical machine going from one concept to
another in a systematic way. It takes short cuts, it pushes thoughts in one way
and then another for all kinds of reasons. The thinking machine is creative, but
mainly for its own purposes.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. TRIZ</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So how do we get round having to work with this set of fairly
unreliable thinking machines, which don’t even ‘show’ you what is being seen by
your eyes?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well, what is very useful is a set of tools which help you
handle each of the thinking steps so that you can check and double check that
your brain is not misguiding you about what is going on. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can use the concept of TRIZ functionality and if there is
any doubt about the functionality because it is being offered and explained at
an abstract level (e.g. bright colours ‘help’ people see the warning signs) you
can ask for functionality descriptions at a harder molecular/quantum level (e.g.
for a short time more energetic photons trigger more neuronal responses from the
retina).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can use the concept of Resources to get people to check
that the entire list of possible Resources of what is available and what could
be available has been worked on for possibilities.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can use Ideality to ask how much the model can be
simplified, what can be cut out, what can be replaced with simpler items.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can check systematically, piece by piece, attribute by
attribute, how far down the path of evolution of complexity has each feature
moved?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And finally, or maybe even as the first step, you can ask
what kinds of Contradictions are in the system as currently designed.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given what we know about the brain now, we can see that when
we simply go into creative approaches for problem solving, trusting that the
brains we have will be able to sort out the various options in a reliable way we
often get things wrong. But by using TRIZ tools in a systematic way we can avoid
many of the problems that emerge. Our brains cannot be reliable; they are not
built for reliability but for efficiency. With our TRIZ tools we can check what
our brains are offering step by step. We can move our thoughts along
analytically, in ways which do not destroy the creative potential of doing
things in a different way.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. So why does TRIZ work?</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we review many of the great advances in science they have
come about because we have found a way to review what we think we are seeing. We
may have thought we saw the Sun go round the Earth, but when we had the
telescope we found that what we were seeing did not quite fit, neatly, what we
thought we were seeing. In the same way, a microscope helps us see what is going
on and ever finer ways of probing small things give us ever greater insights
into what is there.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to learn how to see things reliably because the brain
can create any number of ways of seeing things. It is more creative than
accurate. It has to be in order to make any sense at all of the mass of data it
gets all the time and which, were it not for a bit of creative licence, would
never make sense. We, meaning our brains, take an active part in how we
construct our world. We can’t do this without some respect for what is out
there, of course. But also, we can’t expect the world to tell us how it is all
put together. It won’t.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just as the telescope and the microscope are tools for seeing
the physical properties of objects, there are other tools for seeing into the
functionality of things. These are the tools of science and mathematics, logic
and modelling. Our creative minds can set up all kinds of imaginary worlds, with
demons and monsters, ethereal beings and aliens of any kinds. Over millennia we
have created all kinds of demonic models of the physical world, and slowly, as
our tools for examining these models become more sophisticated, the models
improve. TRIZ helps us manage our creative thinking by allowing us to test the
options that the brain suggests, slowly and methodically, either in a simple
logical way or by comparison with analogous designs. The TRIZ tools provide a
different kind of focus on features of ideas, and this different focus gives us
new features which help us review our model.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we used to think that our brains slowly worked towards
an ever more accurate model of the world we could believe that the model in our
heads somehow matched the world outside. Now we know that we have no distinct
models in our heads; we have systems which are constantly reviewing and
reworking the world in a creative way. We can see that we need an external
process for checking our thinking, if this is to be truly reliable. TRIZ offers
us one set of checking tools. TRIZ need not, and maybe should not, be seen as a
set of process tools based on engineering design and problem solving. That was
simply the source for the research. The object of the research with TRIZ was
really the thinking process itself. TRIZ has aided the development of thinking
about thinking. At heart, it is a fundamental set of psychological tools for the
very essence of thinking. Well done Altshuller!</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6. Conclusion</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is great fun, and very easy, to use TRIZ tools in an open
and creative way, simply going for idea after idea, until you get that buzz
which tells you this is the one to go for! Trusting intuition in this way is
probably very wise and certainly efficient - most of the time!</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But if you really have to get it right, and be sure you are
getting it right, then this is where TRIZ offers a systematic approach not
shared by other problem solving tool kits. And it is because of how the brain
works, with its multi layered patches of networks and connections, all firing
and not firing in ways which are impossible to mimic, that we need the system of
TRIZ to keep our ideas in good order.</p>
