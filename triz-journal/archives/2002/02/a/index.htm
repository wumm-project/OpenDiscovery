<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

earns respect, and<font COLOR="#ff0000"><b>
Innovation</b> </font>differentiates your product
from the competition, as well as, attracts the competitor’s clientele while
ensuring customer loyalty. Successful integration of these three all but
guarantees a bright future. Somewhere in the late 20th century, many
leading companies realized that the Product Development Process was as important
as the product itself. In order to achieve these three goals Design for Six
Sigma initiatives were born.</p>
<p>To date, there are numerous “versions” of Six Sigma and Design for Six Sigma,
to mention a few: MAIC, DMAIC, DMADV, DMEDI, DIDOV, IDDOV, etc. The best
approach a company can take is to understand the critical elements contained
within each version, and then customize what you have learned to fit your
corporate culture. This article (and roadmap) illustrates a “macro” perspective
of common elements found within various Design for Six Sigma Programs. These
elements are integrated into a unique and simplified graphical roadmap titled
“Concept to Customer” Roadmap.</p>
<p><b>The “Concept to Customer” Roadmap</b></p>
<p>This “Concept to Customer” roadmap involves a set of structured and logical
activities that focus on the customer, cultivate innovation, ensure robustness,
maintain reliability, reduce cost, and ultimately increase value for the end
customer and shareholders. Many companies today understand the relative
importance of these three elements, and are introducing rigorous methods to
achieve them in every aspect of their business. </p>
<p>Notes on the “Concept to Customer” process in Figure 1:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>The order of events and the extent to which each proposed step
    (represented in Figure 1) should be practiced will be debated forever. It is
    the authors’ opinion that this roadmap represents a logical flowchart that
    integrates common Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) Methods and tools, into a
    “user-friendly” roadmap.</li>
  <li>There are several “entry points” into the “Concept to Customer”
    process that are dependant on the project objectives and where you are in
    your engineering and business situation.</li>
  <li>To illustrate all the possible paths one could travel in the “Concept
    to Customer” process would yield a spaghetti chart. The most common paths
    are illustrated with red arrows.</li>

<p>The Concept to Customer Roadmap can be summarized and broken up into 5 main
Stages:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li><b>Define the Opportunity and Understand your Customers</b>: Since
        the customer defines quality, a meticulous knowledge of each of your
        customers must be understood and documented. Numerous techniques are
        available to understand your customer. Steps A, B, C, and D focus on
        understanding your customers better than they understand themselves.</li>
  <li><b>Form Really Does Follow Function</b>. Functions are the most
        important aspect of any Product or Service. Value is measured by the
        ratio of Functions to Cost (F/C). Maximizing this ratio and engineering
        the most appropriate set of functions to respond to the customer’s
        requirements must be very well thought through. Steps E, F, and G focus
        on formulating the right “model” of your product or process, then
        introduce steps to ensure a reliable delivery. </li>
  <li><b>Innovate or Die!</b> Technical challenges and a harsh
        competitive environment make innovation mandatory. Most people think
        only “special” people have the ability to innovate. Wrong! Numerous
        methods exist to greatly enhance the ability of anyone to generate
        unique and elegant ideas. Steps H and I introduce numerous techniques to
        generate, evaluate, and synthesize new ideas.</li>
  <li><b>Robustness Leads to Loyalty</b>: A robust product or service is
        one that behaves consistently in the presence of factors that cannot be
        controlled or are too expensive to control. Companies who consistently
        deliver robust products have many loyal followers. Steps J and L
        introduce methods to ensure robust products and manufacturing processes.</li>
  <li><b>Maintain the Gains</b>: Once your product and process has been
        designed, production controls and continuous improvement activities are
        needed in order to ensure capability and eliminate unforeseen waste.
        Steps M and N illustrate popular techniques for the above. </li>
