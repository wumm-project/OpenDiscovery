<p>Introduction</p>
</b>
<p>This article follows on from previous ones discussing in one instance the
space between the generic solution triggers offered by TRIZ and the specific
solutions desired by a problem solver (Reference 1), and in the other, the
optimization versus innovation debate discussed in Reference 2. </p>
<p>The title and inspiration behind this article comes from a chapter in
Inventive Minds written by David Perkins (Reference 3). The chapter ‘The
Topography of Invention’ introduces the idea of ‘Klondike’ and ‘Homing’ solution
search strategies. A Homing strategy is one in which the local conditions of the
problem suggest to the solver that a given direction is correct, and thus the
solver’s task becomes one of homing-in on an optimum. A Klondike search on the
other hand - as in ‘searching to find the Klondike’ - is indicative of a rather
more random solution prospecting activity.</p>
<p>Perkins uses a topography analogy to help discriminate between the two search
types. A version of this analogy is illustrated in Figure 1. </p>

</font><font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 1: Topographic Analogy Between Klondike and Homing
Solution Search Strategies</p>
</b></font>
<p>The analogy uses the idea of contours to represent the presence or otherwise
of problem solutions. The idea of a local valley or trough is used to indicate
the location of an ‘optimum’ solution - i.e. lowest topographic point = optimum
solution. In the analogy, the gradient of the local terrain surrounding the
problem owner’s current position is the thing that prompts a shift from Klondike
to Homing search strategies. Presence of a downward gradient is indicative of a
heading towards an optimum solution, while upward gradient is indicative of a
move away from an optimum. Zero gradient is indicative of a Klondike space in
which there are no clues to guide the problem solver.</p>
<p>To take the Klondike analogy a little further, before any gold was found, the
search by prospectors was random (and thus a ‘Klondike search’), but as soon as
they received their first clues - e.g. finding traces of gold in a river bed -
the method of searching shifts to one of Homing. The presence of gold traces in
a riverbed is an example of how the local terrain provides homing cues (local
gradient) to help point the prospector to the mother lode - i.e. ‘search further
upstream’ is the direction presented in this example.</p>
<p>The analogy is useful and consistent with several parallel problem solving
concepts, two of which we will discuss here: The first is a parallel with the
Edward De Bono analogy of solution finding being like digging for treasure in a
field first discussed in a TRIZ context in Reference 4. This analogy is
particularly useful because it serves to remind us that all the time we are
searching for lower points in a terrain (and after finding one, then proceeding
to dig the hole deeper), we become less and less likely to be able to see the
terrain outside of our trough/valley. This is psychological inertia, and both Dr
DeBono and TRIZ are trying to encourage us to get back onto the level ground in
order that we might see where other troughs and valleys exist or might exist in
the future if we choose to dig there.</p>
<p>The second parallel emerges when we turn the topographic map on its side and
look at the situation from the new perspective illustrated in Figure 2.</p>

</font><font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 2: Cross-Section Through Topographic Image of Solution
Space</p>
</b></font>
<p>The important concept here is our frequent inability or reluctance to climb a
hill (de-optimize) in order to begin the quest to find a better minimum
(optimum) somewhere else in the solution space. While this can also be seen as
psychological inertia in action, it is actually more profound because it implies
that the de-optimize process is actually fundamental to the location of better
optima elsewhere. Nature frequently falls into this trap (Reference 5); with
evolutionary processes finding it very difficult to permit de-optimized systems
succeed over optimized ones. The classic example of this in action is the human
eye and the presence of a blind spot because of the way the design bundles and
routes optic nerve fibres out of the eye. Millions of years of evolution have
optimized the position of the nerve bundle to minimize the extent and intrusion
of the blind spot, and it will be very unlikely to now shift to a design in
which the nerve bundles exit from somewhere other than the retina.</p>
<p>The Klondike/Homing/topographic analogy is useful and connects well to a
number of other ideas in and around TRIZ. The rest of the article examines four
such areas - the connection with psychology of different individual character
types; the way we can use the TRIZ solution triggers to assist during Klondike
searches; connections to DeBono thinking and the TRIZ System Operator; and the
connection between the topographic analogy and that of evolutionary potential
and Ideal Final Result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Klondike versus Homing/Adaptor versus Innovator</p>
</b>
<p>One of the main points made by the Perkins topography chapter is that certain
individual character types appear happier in <i>either</i> Klondike <i>or</i>
Homing search modes; that because the two require such distinctly different
skills, it is difficult to find or cultivate them both in one person. There
appear to be distinct parallels here with the Kirton Adaptor-Innovator (KAI)
method of establishing character type. Further discussion about KAI in a TRIZ
context may be found in Reference 6.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article, it is worth recording the perceived strong
links between the Kirton ‘Adaptor’ character type and people who are happiest
solving problems in a Homing mode. In other words adaptors appear happier at
optimization-type problems where the local terrain provides cues to help the
solver reach a (local) optimum solution. Innovator character types on the other
hand appear happiest operating in the uncertainties presented by Klondike spaces
where there is no local terrain contour information to act as a guide.</p>
<p>The principal connection to TRIZ of course when thinking about Klondike
search spaces is that the Inventive Principles, the Inventive Standards, the
evolution trends, and knowledge/effects databases all provide pointers to help
problem solvers find ‘good’ places to dig for treasure (solutions). These
pointers appear to be more liked by and more useful to the Adaptor character
type. After the thrill of their first few exposures to the TRIZ tools, strongly
Innovator-oriented character types are prone to either reject or search for
things outside TRIZ. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Connection To TRIZ Solution Triggers</p>
</b>
<p>TRIZ is not the only tool, method or philosophy to offer solution pointers to
help navigate Klondike search spaces, but it is easily the most comprehensive.
The most interesting link to outside methods comes with some of Edward DeBono’s
work on the manner in which our brains physiologically operate (Reference 7).
One of the most commonly applied of DeBono’s strategies for searching Klondike
spaces - see Figure 3 - is the random word connector; the problem solver selects
a random word from a dictionary and then strives to make connections between
that word and the problem at hand. The method works because are very good
pattern and connection forming entities. The method is useful in a Klondike
context because the random word inevitably takes us to somewhere else (another
X) in the search terrain.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 3: Topographic Analogy And Solution Triggers</p>
</b></font>
<p>The point here, however, comes following a recent experiment in which a group
of people were asked to provide a random word to use as a trigger to help
conceptualise a better design of product. The product chosen was a mobile phone;
the random word was elephant. Importantly, neither the group nor I knew each
other’s word beforehand.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p>Figure 4 illustrates some of the connections made by the group after they
were asked to suggest how ‘elephant’ might help to design a better phone.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 4: Use of ‘Elephant’ To Help Design A Better Mobile
Phone<br>
(partial picture - details omitted for clarity)</p>
</b></font>
<p>After the connection-making phase was finished, the solution ideas generated
were analysed relative to the TRIZ Inventive Principles. The working hypothesis
was that all of the ideas generated by connecting ‘phone’ to ‘elephant’ could
also be generated using the TRIZ solution triggers; or, in other words, that the
dictionary of useful random words needs to contain only very few (40 Principles,
plus 76 Standards, plus 8/17/20/31 depending how you slice them, trends) of the
tens of thousands of words in a normal dictionary.</p>
<p>While in no way considered as exhaustive, it was discovered that all of the
connections made by the group were indeed consistent with this hypothesis; each
one having a direct correlation to one or more of the TRIZ triggers:</p>

<p>Subsequent other connections between ‘phone’ and other random words have
similarly failed to generate ideas which the TRIZ triggers would not have
obtained more directly. The reader might like to try the experiment for
themselves - a bounty for any useful connections that none of the TRIZ triggers
would provide! </p>
<p>The continuing hypothesis therefore remains standing that the TRIZ triggers
will connect us to all of the good ideas that might be generated by a whole
dictionary full of random words; that the TRIZ triggers will point us to all of
the good places to dig in a Klondike search space (‘all’ is a very strong word -
as TRIZ is built from the world’s scientific excellence, a better description
would be ‘all of the solutions that would be found by all of the world’s past
and current inventive minds’. There is always the chance (hope) that there are
new as yet undiscovered solution triggers out there in Klondike space). </p>
<p>To offer a more visual image, Figure 5 suggests that a Klondike search space
for a problem like ‘better mobile phone’ contains a number of ‘good’ places to
dig for solutions. We can use a random word to help find these places (and thus
risk the possibility that we will not choose enough random words to locate all
of the good places), or we can use TRIZ triggers to directly tell us where ‘all’
(see above) of those good places are.</p>

<b>
<p>Connection With DeBono and System Operator</p>
</b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p>Before leaving Edward DeBono connections, it is also useful to make a link
between the earlier idea that it is sometimes necessary to de-optimize from a
local optimum in order to find a ‘better’ optimum elsewhere and the DeBono image
of problem solving as a journey along a road - Figure 5.</p>
<font SIZE="2"><b>

<p align="left">Figure 5: DeBono and System Operator Analogy<br>
(the better start-point might be in the Past)</p>
</b></font>
<p>DeBono’s purpose in drawing the road-travelling analogy is that sometimes we
miss junctions and turnings that might lead to better solutions, and that it is
sometimes necessary to retrace our footsteps in order to (re)find the turnings
we did not make.</p>
<p>This links very directly to the TRIZ System Operator ‘Past’ windows and the
fact that somewhere in the problem history these turnings might have been
spotted and ignored. A commonly applied and often useful strategy in this regard
is to apply the TRIZ solution triggers not just to the current system, but to
also apply them to an earlier incarnation of the design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Connection With Evolutionary Potential and Ideal Final Result </p>
</b>
<p>The final connection regarding the concept of Klondike and Homing search
strategies emerges when we again turn the search terrain image on its side and
look at it from a new perspective. This time we make a connection between the
depth of the valleys (i.e. measure of ‘good’ness of the local solution) and
ideality.</p>
<p>Figure 6 illustrates an isometric view of our search terrain showing how
increasing depth into the terrain may be related to increasing ideality, with a
maximum possible depth relating to the concept of Ideal Final Result. The
important point in this figure, however, is the idea of ‘evolutionary limits’
and the fact that a) any given hole has a maximum possible depth (an
evolutionary limit), and b) that this maximum depth may be some considerable
distance away from the depth of the IFR. This connection to the idea to that of
evolutionary limits - i.e. the maximum depth that any given local hole may be
dug and evolutionary potential - the amount of material we could dig out of the
hole but haven’t yet (strongly linked to the idea of evolving a system to the
ends of each of the TRIZ trends of evolution - Reference 8) gives another useful
image of the problem solving process.</p>

</font><font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 6: Connection Between Topographic Analogy, Evolutionary
Potential and IFR</p>
</b></font>
<p>The idea of evolutionary potential (the untapped evolutionary possibilities
if we take the current system and take it all the way along all of the TRIZ
technology evolution trends) and the we can use up all of this potential from a
given start point and not achieve IFR seems to encapsulate all of the previous
ideas and thoughts regarding psychological inertia, the need to de-optimize
sometimes, and the use of TRIZ solution triggers to find other places to start
digging. It also serves to re-enforce the importance of starting from IFR and
digging back up to the surface.</p>
