<i><b>
<p>Abstract</p>
</b></i>
<p>In recent years TRIZ has gained increasing interest in the manufacturing
industry in the Western world. This interest is driven by different factors
including:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Companies introduce product innovations faster and on the other hand have
  more difficulty to attract skilled R&amp;D professionals.</li>
  <li>The availability of state-of-the-art software supporting the TRIZ
  methodology.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also in process industry, TRIZ interest increases. There are several points
of attention, differing from product development, in applying TRIZ in the
process industry:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>the ‘product’ is intimately linked to the process by which it is made .
  Any change in the product is mostly achieved by an adaptation of the process.</li>
  <li>the TRIZ knowledge base has initially been built on information contained
  in patents. But ‘kitchen secrets’ of <u>how</u> to produce a metal alloy or an
  engineering plastic are usually not patented. </li>
  <li>Causes of a problem in a process cannot easily be pinpointed. The problems
  can be tracked down to causes in areas like raw materials, chemistry, control
  loops etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the article it will be described how TRIZ can be a success when applied to
typical problems of the process industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>
<p>TRIZ in the process industry ?</p>
</b></i>
<p>There is a very important reason to increase the insight into the
possibilities of the TRIZ methodology for the improvement of production
processes. As one can see in the figure 1, in the beginning of the lifetime of a
product, one sees a high number of product innovations. As the product becomes
more mature, the number of product innovations is reduced drastically, at least
until a trend shift occurs. During this stage of the product (a major part of
the life-cycle), improvements will mainly be achieved through changes and
innovations in the production process. It would therefore be very unwise to
limit the application of TRIZ to product improvements. This means that we will
have to identify the reasons which, at first sight, hinder the application of
TRIZ in the process industry. After this identification, we will have to find
ways to overcome these impediments. </p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="01.gif" width="636" height="244"></p>
<p>We will, in this paragraph, address the most important factors that seem to
limit the use of TRIZ there :</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>TRIZ is based on an analysis of patents</li>
  <li>TRIZ examples are often “product” examples</li>
  <li>The real cause of a problem is often hidden somewhere in the process</li>
  <li>There exists an intimate link between the product and the process by which
  it is manufactured.</li>
</ol>
<p>These factors off course do not hinder the application of TRIZ in the process
industry, but they can serve as immediate arguments for those who have their
doubts about TRIZ. It is important that TRIZ-professionals understand the origin
of these arguments. They also have to be prepared to counter them : these
arguments are not false (the fact that they are very much true make them good
arguments), but they are not, for reasons explained further in this article,
blocking the application of TRIZ in the process industry.</p>
<dir>
  <p><b>1. TRIZ is based on an analysis of patents</b></p>
</dir>
<p>TRIZ is based on an in-depth analysis of patents. These patents have led to
the development of the different TRIZ-techniques e.g the 40 principles, the
trends of evolution and the construction of the TRIZ knowledge base<sup><a href="#1e">1</a></sup>.<a name="1"></a> Typical
about improvements in manufacturing processes is that these are often not
patented. As long as it is not possible to see from properties (specifications,
form, structure, …) of the product, what process change has brought about the
improvement, companies tend not to make public (by patenting or otherwise) the
ins-and-outs of this process change. Another reason why companies are reluctant
to patent process improvements is that it is much easier to “work your way
around” such patents than it is for product improvements. </p>
<p>Therefore companies in the process industry are not sure how they can benefit
from a methodology that has the worldwide patent databases as its basis. </p>
<dir>
  <p><b>2. TRIZ examples are often “product” examples</b></p>
</dir>
<p>Most of the applications of TRIZ published are “product” application (see
e.g. the TRIZ-journal). They focus on improving a product by enhancing its
useful functions or by eliminating harmful ones. A major difference with
“process” cases is that in a process the substances that are introduced in the
beginning of the process undergo one or more changes before they form the
product. These changes can be :</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Chemical reactions</li>
  <li>Separations</li>
  <li>Shape transformations</li>
  <li>Etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>This means that in the analysis phase of the TRIZ-process, and especially in
the functional modeling, one has to make a distinction between the substances
that originally enter the process and the intermediary or end product(s). This
is even essential if the substances perform different functions in different
stages of the process. E.g. the functions (useful and harmful) of the substances
that enter a chemical reaction will be other than the function(s) of the
end-product, since this is probably the reason to have that chemical reaction in
the first place. The occurrence of intermediary and by-products makes this even
more complex. </p>
<p>So, when applying TRIZ to manufacturing processes, extra care has to be given
to the analysis and modeling stages. It would be very beneficiary if more
elaborate examples of process problems solved with TRIZ would be published. </p>

<dir>
  <b>
  <p>3. The real cause of a problem is often hidden somewhere in the process</p>
  </b>
</dir>
<p>The problems that occur in the functioning of products, can often be
pinpointed quite accurately. The specific component in the product that is
causing the problem most of the time is immediately known after the problem is
identified. In the process industry however, the actual cause of a problem (the
“root cause”) is often hidden somewhere in the process. Off spec production, or
an excess amount of energy consumed, can be due to different kinds of root
causes somewhere earlier in the process. Off course there is a possibility, when
searching for solutions to the problem, to address each of the possible causes
one by one. But this will take a lot of time, because the whole TRIZ process of
analysis and idea generation in fact has to be repeated once for every possible
cause. In order for TRIZ to be efficiently applied in the process industry, it
will be necessary to address this complication.</p>
<dir>
  <b>
  <p>4. There exists an intimate link between the product and the process by
  which it is manufactured.</p>
  </b>
</dir>
<p>There exists an intimate link between a product and the process by which it
is manufactured. This is off course the case in any kind of industry, but when
the product that is being manufactured is a pellet, a powder or some other form
of base product, that gets is use from the properties of the substance from
which it is composed, any improvement in the product will have to be achieved by
changes in the production process. In many cases this will not be achieved by
interchanging one substance by another, but by changing the process parameters
(pressure, temperature, …), the process operation or by trying to achieve other
reaction mechanisms. In the process industry, it is not strange to say that “the
process is the product”. This is off course the main reason why the process
industry is called “process industry” in the first place. </p>
<p>For the application of TRIZ, this fact has to be combined with :</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>the high costs introduced by changing the manufacturing process</li>
  <li>compliance with legislation</li>
  <li>the stringent security issues involved in these processes</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors combined give another reason why there are, at first a lot of
doubts about the applicability of TRIZ in the process industry.</p>
<font SIZE="2"></font><i><b>
<p>TRIZ in the process industry!</p>
</b></i>
<p>TRIZ is very successfully applied in the process industry. How is that
possible, in view of the obvious objections raised in the previous paragraph.
Below we will give a number of reasons for this. </p>
<dir>
  <b>
  <p>1. Functional modeling and trimming</p>
  </b>
</dir>
<p>In product development, design and development methodologies are widely used.
Functional modeling and functional thinking are known here through the
application of these methodologies. Robust design, Value management, FMEA … in
all of these methodologies “functional modeling” is used in some way. In the
process industry, this is less the case. In the chemical industry e.g. it is
much more common to think in “unit-operations” than to analyze the functions of
the different components and substances in a process. So the mere introduction
of “functional thinking” is very useful here. In TechOptimizer, the Process
Analysis is focused on modeling the manufacturing processes. Here the functions
can be given an additional tag :</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Productive : a function that has to be performed in order to arrive at the
  final product</li>
  <li>Providing : a function enabling or facilitating subsequent functions</li>
  <li>Corrective : a function eliminating unwanted characteristics</li>
  <li>Harmful : an unwanted function</li>
</ol>
<p>If one categorizes the functions in the process this way, it always appears
that the number of productive functions is very limited. The other functions
that are present are either :</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>the result of unwanted but inevitable interactions (by-products, property
  changes) </li>
  <li>the result of implementation choices made to perform the providing
  functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>This way of looking at functions in a production process clearly
distinguishes the options one has to improve it. There are many examples to give
where revealing the basic function of a substance opens up the road to other
ways of fulfilling it. </p>
<p>To give a few examples. </p>
</p><ul>
  <li>In many chemical processes, the basic operation is a chemical reaction
  followed by (a number of ) separation steps to isolate the useful component
  from the by-products of the process. Very often a solvent is used in the
  reactor. At first sight the purpose of the solvent is to keep the different
  substances in a solution. But looking more closely to this function and trying
  to approach it on a more generic level, one can state that often the purpose
  of the solvent is simply to “reduce the viscosity”. The viscosity has to be
  reduced in order to be able to stir the mixture. This is because one needs a
  homogeneous mixture to make sure that the substances that interact “meet” each
  other. Now this opens up a whole range of possibilities to improve the
  interaction besides the use of a solvent. One possibility is the use of
  acoustic cavitation to improve the reaction, but one can also think about ways
  to remove the end-product of the reaction as soon as it is formed. </li>
  <li>Another way of improvement in processes is the TRIZ idea of maximizing the
  use of resources. One of the least used resources in the process industry is
  transportation : both through pipes and by using trucks, trains and boats. The
  only function that is performed by these resources is “move substance”. There
  are a lot of ways to add additional functionality to these pipes and other
  transportation means : stirring, mixing, creating more time to finish certain
  reactions, …. That this would be feasible indeed is illustrated by the
  application of tube reactors, which is already done at certain industries.
  Here reaction (sometimes in different stages) and the movement of substances
  are combined. But there are undoubtedly more applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<dir>
  <b>
  <p>2. Root cause analysis and problem analysis</p>
  </b>
</dir>
<p>As we already stated above, in processes the actual cause of a problem (the
“root cause”) is often hidden somewhere in the process. Off spec production, or
an excess amount of energy consumed, can be due to different kinds of root
causes somewhere upstream the process. This means that the whole process of
functionally modeling the problem at hand can become very complex. Indeed, the
effort needed to model all possible areas or steps in a process where a possible
cause of the problem is located can be huge. Also, TRIZ does not offer much
support in dealing with this contradiction : on the one hand one would like to
take all possible options into account, but then, on the other hand, time
consumed by the process could become prohibitive. Or to state it in TRIZ terms :
one wants to improve the <u>reliability</u> of the problem solving process by
addressing all the possible causes but then the <u>loss of time</u> could become
too high. The contradiction matrix in this case would suggest to perform a <u>
prior action</u>. </p>
<p>This is a place where the Russian TRIZ methodology can meet some of the
Western methodologies. Root Cause Analysis (RCA), Failure Mode and Effect
Analysis (FMEA) and the Theory of Constraints (TOC)<a name="2"></a><sup><a name="2" href="#2e" style="text-decoration: none">2</a></sup> are a few methodologies that
can be combined with TRIZ, to achieve a more efficient way of approaching the
problems faced in production processes. All these methodologies provide one with
a way to relate a number of features occurring in a process to the same “root
cause”. This is mainly done through the development of Cause-and-Effect graphs,
providing insight in the way the “root cause” leads to the occurrence of the
different features. Before continuing with the TRIZ process, one has to
determine what the possible “root causes” of the deviations are and which of the
root causes is most likely to have produced the deviations. Furthermore one has
to decide at what level(s) of the Cause-and-Effect chain one wants to focus. It
is clear that in order to prevent e.g. environmental contamination by a
production process one can choose to :</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Increase or improve detection of leaks, so that, when contamination
  occurs, one is warned sooner</li>
  <li>Increase the robustness of the pipe or vessel where the leaks can occur</li>
  <li>Change to another way of operation, using less contaminating substances,</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>or indeed a combination of these. Combining (one of ) these methodologies
with TRIZ will undoubtedly improve the chances of successful application of TRIZ
in the process industry.</p>
<b>
<blockquote>
  <p>3. Generic knowledge in principles</p>
</blockquote>
</b>
<p>But off course the best proof of the applicability of TRIZ in the process
industry is the successful application of the different TRIZ tools to specific
process related problems. Here we will give a few examples of how the 40
principles, one of the most widely used TRIZ tools, can be used. </p>
<b>
<p>Principle 34 : Rejecting and Regenerating Parts<a name="3"></a></b><sup><a name="3" href="#3e">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Many chemical processes start with a reaction step during which the main
product is formed as well as, unfortunately mostly inevitable , a number of
by-products. In quite a few reactors these by-products have very negative
consequences :</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Interaction of the by-products with the main product, thereby creating
  other by-product</li>
  <li>Deterioration of the catalyst used</li>
  <li>Exothermal by-reactions, which necessitates the use of cooling water and
  thus the destruction of (expensive) energy</li>
</ul>
<p>Principle 34 could be used as a direction of improvement. If one could find a
way of removing the primary product or (one of) by-products immediately after it
has been produced, the unwanted effects stated above could be reduced
drastically. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Principle 6 : Universality</p>
</b>
<p>At the moment, several research projects are on, focusing on process
intensification (see e.g. &lt;http://www.ncl.ac.uk/pin&gt; or &lt;http://www.bhrgroup.co.uk/confsite/pi01home.htm&gt;
). A main change in the process industry has been the identification of the fact
that there exist “unit operations” which perform essentially the same function :
distillation, reaction, exchanging heat, … This has lead to the development of
generic systems that perform these functions. These systems where as independent
as possible on the specific industry where they where applied : chemical, steel,
food &amp; beverage … Nowadays, one starts to learn that there is a lot to gain in
process efficiency and / or the use of energy when combining several “unit
operations” in one system. <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<img SRC="Image239.gif" border="1" align="right" width="173" height="250"></font>Examples are :</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Reactive distillation (already often used)</li>
  <li>Micro-reactors combining intensively a reactor and a heat-exchanger</li>
  <li>Dryer-granulators</li>
</ul>
<p>But it is certain that more and more applications will rise from these
projects. This is a very nice example of the application of principle 6.</p>
<p>“Trimming” (which can be viewed as a special application of the principle
“Universality”) is a very important principle to apply in manufacturing
processes. Very often, after identifying the cause of a process deviation or an
unwanted by-effect in a process, additional equipment is installed to remove the
cause. The problem with this type of solution is that one also introduces new
possible sources of trouble.<a name="4"></a><sup><a name="4" href="#4e">4</a></sup></p>
<p>This can indeed lead to a situation in which additional equipment is used to
reduce the effect of problems that are the result of the fact that additional
equipment is used to reduce the effect of problems that are the result of the
fact that … A way to overcome this is to consider “trimming” : remove
(components of) the system so that one gets rid of its harmful effect (causing
the process deviation) and try to transfer its useful effects to already
existing (components of) the system. Off course that will not be possible in
every case but very often “trimming” is an option that is not even taken into
account when trying to resolve a process deviation.</p>
<p>The use of this principle in the process industry has also been illustrated
already in section 1 of this chapter, when we discussed the use of
transportation means for performing other functions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Principle 31 : Porous material</p>
</b>
<p>The increasing use of membranes in extraction, cleaning and separation
processes is one of the most clear illustrations of the fact that principle 31
is finding applications in the process industry. </p>
<p>These examples primarily illustrate the fact that the TRIZ principles,
although (as we stated before in this article) derived from patents which
usually deal with product innovations, are generic enough to be used for
improvements in manufacturing processes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i><b>
<p>Conclusions</p>
</b></i>
<p>A number of conclusions can be drawn about the application of TRIZ in the
process industry both from the information in this article and from our personal
experience :</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>TRIZ is and will be successfully applied in the process industry. Already
  the introduction of functional analysis offers a lot of added benefit and
  possibilities for improvement</li>
  <li>RCA + TRIZ are a strong team. Making explicit the possible causes of a
  problem and their interdependence is an important step to make before trying
  to solve the problem.</li>
  <li>TRIZ knowledge is indeed generic enough to be used for production
  processes</li>
  <li>The adoption of TRIZ as a methodology for solving problems in the process
  industry would benefit a lot if more cases studies would be published.</li>
