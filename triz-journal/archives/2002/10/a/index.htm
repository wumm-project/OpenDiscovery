<p>The editors asked three corporate users of TechOptimizer, two of whom also
are their companies’ internal TRIZ and TechOptimizer trainers, to review this
book. </p>
<p>TechOptimizer Fundamentals</i> fills what has been a persistent gap in the
documentation for this popular application supportive of TRIZ. While the <i>
TechOptimizer User Guide</i> that comes with the program details every menu
option and action, it shows them from the program's point of view (the &quot;what&quot;
and the &quot;how-to&quot;, by menu). <i>TechOptimizer Fundamentals</i> illustrates them
from the point of view of a user (who needs as much the &quot;why&quot; and the &quot;when&quot;).
It will be a useful addition to the bookshelves of all but the most expert
TechOptimizer users-a worthwhile purchase, despite a few shortcomings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had fun reading this book. Probably because I am already familiar with
  TechOptimizer, reading this book wasn’t like reading any other technical
  manual. It felt more like reading a storybook. I liked the way that each
  section was dedicated to different solution modules, modeling technical
  systems, modeling technical processes. The section on the feature transfer
  application was a pleasant bonus</i></font><font SIZE="2">.</p>
  </font><font COLOR="#993366"><i>
  <p>My first reaction was “Great Book!” I think it is exactly what people need
  who learned TechOptimizer a few years ago, or IMLab, and haven’t used it much
  recently. It will get them back to appreciating all the ways this program can
  help them. People who practice TRIZ without software can also get some
  benefit, especially from the function analysis section.</p>
</blockquote>
</i></font><i>
<p>TechOptimizer Fundamentals</i> has chapters devoted to each of the major
problem solving and problem analysis modules (not the Internet Assistant). They
are sequenced more by frequency of use than by order of use. The first half of
the book takes you through the solution generating modules; the latter half, the
problem analysis modules:</p>
<p>Chapter 1 outlines a stereotypical, multiphase methodology for design, and
why one is needed. It introduces the “Innovation Roadmap”-a useful flowchart
that describes sequencing of TechOptimizer modules in-use. It includes the
gathering of background data, the sequencing of use of problem statement tools
(function analysis and trimming, feature transfer), the use of problem solving
tools (effects, prediction, principles), and validation &amp; reporting. Connection
between the design methodology and Roadmap are implied; few details are given
here (or elsewhere) explicitly defining how the steps in the Innovation Roadmap
feed into particular design phases. And don’t be thrown off by the juxtaposition
of “Path 2” and “Path 3” in the text versus the flowchart-just pencil the
correction onto your copy.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 describes the Effects Knowledge Base. It includes an explanation of
how the input, output and control parameters can be used to relate several
effects using the Connect feature. This is helpful if you add your own effects
to the library. </p>
<p>Chapter 3 describes how the Prediction module contributes to helping set R&amp;D
directions, predicting the evolution of technological systems, and improving
interactions between parts of your system.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 on Principles gives the origins &amp; background on technical
contradictions and coaches you upon how to set up technical contradictions using
the three-line template TechOptimizer uses. (Appendix B contains a listing of
the 40 principles; about a quarter of them use wording that has been upgraded in
the current TechOptimizer). Although mentioned, treatment of physical
contradictions is too light (as it is in the software) for the tastes of most
TRIZ users; the opportunity is missed to point out TechOptimizer’s single window
on Physical Contradiction and Separation Principles, which has the corresponding
40 principles aligned to the separation principles.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 on Product &amp; Technical System Modeling has a brief but excellent
primer on how to set up good function analysis statements, and avoid the most
common pitfalls that would interfere with function analysis and trimming. It
describes quite well the method TechOptimizer uses to rank order components to
consider for trimming. In the section on function analysis, beware that
terminology used is inconsistent with current version of TechOptimizer: what the
program calls a &quot;product&quot; this book calls a &quot;target&quot;.</p>
<font COLOR="#339966"><i>
<blockquote>
  <p>First lesson: I had to admit that I have been loosely defining subjects,
  objects and actions in between. Typically I have been defining a subject and
  an object based on the order the components were defined. I like the way this
  book defines, “action has to change object”.</p>
</blockquote>
</i></font>
<p>Chapter 6 describes the corresponding type of modeling for processes. It
coaches you on selection of process types (productive, providing, corrective)
and outlines when the same function, in different circumstances, may be of a
different type. The symbols used in the book for process modeling differ from
those used in current software as well, using a set more like those for product
modeling.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 describes how to use the feature transfer application. Feature
transfer works on the same principles as the concept selection matrix advocated
by Stuart Pugh. A very basic analysis of the functions &amp; characteristics of your
current system identifies shortcomings. TechOptimizer helps you to find
alternative ways of fulfilling those functions better, by importing the
corresponding superior features of other systems.</p>
<font COLOR="#339966"><i>
<blockquote>
  <p>Up to now, I was focusing using the Pugh matrix technique for down
  selecting concepts only. I was quite pleased to learn that this technique can
  also be used to solve problems</i></font><font SIZE="2">. </p>
</blockquote>
</font>
<p>Don’t miss reading the definitions of terms in Appendix A. Re-read the ones
that strike you as out-of-the-ordinary. <font COLOR="#ff00ff"><i><b>Twice!!</b></i></font>
Some will have unique, specific meanings (e.g. feature, property, product,
parameter, target) that must be kept in mind to become facile using
TechOptimizer. Some may cause trouble if used by their common, everyday,
less-specific definitions.</p>
<u><i>
<p>Weaknesses:</i></u> Lack of an index is drawback. Often, examples would
benefit by detailing just one more next step (and having its rationale noted).
<i>TechOptimizer Fundamentals</i> gives short shrift to the “problem manager”
and bare mention of the &quot;concept manager&quot;, missing a chance to point out how
these shortcuts to the outlining function which lists problems and solutions can
automate report writing (which they do mention). A few extra lines explaining
how these interfaces with the user work, and differences depending upon what
module you’re in, would be great additions. A &quot;book answer&quot; key to practice
problems would be nice, making <i>TechOptimizer Fundamentals</i> a useful
adjunct for a short course.</p>
<i><font COLOR="#993366">
<blockquote>
  <p>The lack of a more in-depth way of stepping people through a verification
  of a functional model was the biggest gap that I saw in the book</p>
</blockquote>
</font><font COLOR="#339966">
<p>In consideration for new users of the tool, however, the following are
strongly recommended:</p>
</font></i>
</p><ul>
  <li><font COLOR="#339966"><i>Re-organize sections so that they are in the same
  order as one would use the tool. Move the “Modeling Technical Systems” before
  the solutions.</li>
  </i></font>
  <li><font COLOR="#339966"><i>Provide solutions to sample exercise problems so
  that users can refer to check their solutions. Including at least one exercise
  problem with a solution at the end of the book will be nice. This will give a
  user an opportunity to solve a problem from beginning to end.</li>
  </i></font>
  <li><i><font COLOR="#339966">Section on “Modeling Technical Processes” needs
  to be a little more detailed. I felt very rushed from reading this section.</li>
</ul>
</font><u>
<p>Strengths</u></i>: All-in-all, the strong points of <i>TechOptimizer
Fundamentals</i> outweigh the weaknesses. Most chapters have a set of practice
problems. Screen shots show what to expect without dominating the text. <i>
TechOptimizer Fundamentals</i> has many short examples: TRIZ readers will
recognize a few of the classic ones (e.g. the Luna 16 floodlight bulb, exploding
piles and corrosion-testing acid containers) but a number of different examples
and mini-case study exercises are included. </p>
<font COLOR="#993366"><i>
<blockquote>
  <p>I would definitely recommend this book for the beginning user of IMC tools
  as well as for the advanced user; there is something in here for everyone. I
  also most heartily recommend it for consultants and corporate trainers of
  TechOptimizer since this is an excellent tool to build or augment a training
  presentation.</p>
</blockquote>
</i></font>
<p>Overall, <i>TechOptimizer Fundamentals</i> gives a very good, brief grounding
in the concepts and principles that underlie the foundation of each module. Even
with a few minor inconsistencies (which this review should get you past) it will
help users, especially the novices amongst us, to come up to speed more
effectively.</p>
