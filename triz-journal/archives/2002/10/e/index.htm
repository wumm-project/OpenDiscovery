<p>Introduction</p>
</b>
<p>The Kano diagram is a well established and frequently discussed concept in
many innovation circles, including TRIZ. It offers a very elegant model of what
prompts customers to select one product or service over another. The model
implicitly suggests that those things that �excite� customers hold the key to
what will be successful versus what will not. Beyond this conceptual definition,
however, there is a considerable gap between the knowledge that �excitement�
factors are important and knowing what to do to actually achieve them. The theme
of this short article is to suggest that in many senses �excitement� can be
systematically designed.</p>
<p><b>The Kano Diagram</p>
</b><font FACE="CG Times"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p>The Kano diagram - Figure 1 (Reference 1) - offers an elegant means of
discriminating between different features of design. The diagram is usually
drawn to show three main classes of design feature.</p>

</font>Figure 1: Kano Diagram</p>
</b></font>
<p>Without wishing to repeat what many readers of the Journal will already be
very familiar with, the three basic classes are.-</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <dir>
      <p>1) Basic features - things like the starter motor on a car - no-one
      will buy a car without a starter motor, in the same way that no-one would
      be any more likely to buy a car that had two. Or one bigger one.</p>
      <p>2) Performance features - things like the acceleration capability or
      braking performance of a car where the more of it there is, the happier
      the customer is likely to be. The correlation between performance and
      customer satisfaction is essentially linear in nature.</p>
      <p>3) Excitement features - things that the customer didn�t expect to be
      present in the system, and is �excited� to learn are there. Sticking with
      the car analogies from the previous feature classes, current in-car
      exciters are things like GPS (although this is already rapidly heading
      towards being a �basic� feature in luxury cars), pre-warmed seats, sounds
      systems that modulate volume automatically depending on the presence or
      otherwise of noise, personalised key-fobs and just about anything that
      your car doesn�t have that you think would be really neat if it did.</p>
      <font SIZE="1">
    </dir>
  </dir>
</dir>
</font>
<p>This last definition really gets to the crux of the problems that very
quickly emerges once the importance of the �excitement� features is recognised;
very simply, what excites one person will often not excite someone else. Or,
more seriously, can it ever be possible to define something that would excite
everyone. In other words, finding the �excitement features� is generally
considered to be both highly desirable and even more highly unpredictable.</p>
<p>Welcome, then, to a proposed �Exciter Hypothesis�.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font><b>
<p>An Exciter Hypothesis</p>
</b>
<p>Put simply, the proposed exciter hypothesis is about systematically
identifying and realising the characteristics that make customers �excited� by a
product or service. If this sounds like it cannot be possible, it may be
disturbing to learn that the hypothesis is actually so simple that as soon as it
is defined, I think it will appear �obvious�. </p>
<p>The proposed exciter hypothesis is that <font COLOR="#ff0000">things that
excite customers are things that solve contradictions.</p>
</font>
<p>I suggest that to try and prove this hypothesis would be both impossible and
futile, and so I will not even start to make an attempt. What I will do is
suggest you do the following; </p>
</p><ol>
  <li>think of the last thing that made you go �wow� - it could be something in
  a film, or some feature of a product you saw in a shop or some extraordinary
  piece of service you received in a restaurant; anything in fact that excited
  you.</li>
  <li>Work out what contradiction has been solved.</li>
  <li>If you can�t find what contradiction has been solved, go to step 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>I also make the following analogies that I think are helpful in understanding
and at least partially substantiating the hypothesis:</p>
<p>Jokes. Jokes are literally all about contradictions. What makes us laugh at a
joke is the resolution of a contradiction - the joke teller has sent us in one
direction, while the punch-line resides in another. We laugh when we resolve the
difference between the two directions. Now think about one of the reactions you
had when you saw one of the �wow� things you pictured in the exercise above. It
is highly likely that one of those reactions was that you laughed.</p>
<p>�Never seen that before�. You are very unlikely to be �wowed� by something
that you have seen before, in the same way that you are very unlikely to laugh
at a joke the second time you hear it. Things you have not seen before tend to
be things that have made a jump from the norm. Another way of saying �a jump
from the norm� is moving to a new s-curve. The primary mechanism by which
systems jump from one s-curve to another is the successive emergence and
resolution of contradictions.</p>
<p>Freebies. Occasionally, some of the things that excite us or make us go �wow�
are things like discovering an unexpected feature that we �haven�t paid for�.
For example, I bought a coat a couple of winters ago that I seem to still be
finding useful pockets in that I never knew were there when I bought the coat.
While it is not immediately obvious that these �freebie� type solutions solve a
real contradiction (certainly not on the part of the supplier anyway), they do
solve a customer perceived contradiction between what I expected to get and what
I ended up getting.</p>
<font SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p>Some Exciters</p>
</b>
<p>Again, no amount of examples will ever (or should ever) convince anyone of
the truth of the hypothesis this article proposes. Nevertheless, I think it is
worth highlighting some of the things that made me go �wow� in the past few
months in order to show how important contradictions are in defining that wow
reaction. </p>
<p>Humans being humans, and me being different from you, means that what made me
go �wow� will probably not provoke the exact same reaction in you (although
there should be at least a flicker of connection I hope). Fortunately this isn�t
the point of the exercise. Unfortunately, when you see some of the things that
make me go �wow�, you are possibly likely to think I am living in a strange
parallel universe. I guess I will learn to live with this fact.</p>
<b>
<p>1) Smart Car</p>
</b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p>I usually struggle these days when people ask me for examples of �good
design� (the reason being that nowadays I tend to see everything around me as
collections of as yet unresolved contradictions rather than things of elegance
or beauty), but I was forced to admit a sneaking admiration for the ultra-small
Smart car that has recently taken Europe by storm. Initially, I thought that the
design was merely shifting the traditional size-weight compromise to a new
point, but in actual fact, it has very much solved a contradiction when it comes
to occupant safety. Here, traditionally, the compromise is such that the shorter
the car, the more difficult it is to protect the occupant during a head-on
collision. The Smart design solves the contradiction by deflecting during impact
in such a way that, instead of trapping the occupant, it moves them (Principle
17, Another Dimension) upwards and out of harms way.</p>

rises)</p>
</font><b>
<p>2) Crispy Microwave Fries</p>
</b>
<p>It is probably very indulgent for me to cite one of my own solutions as an
example of a �wow�, so thankfully I can state that I had the pleasure of
collaborating with good friend Barry Winkless from Ireland on this problem.
Anyone that has had the misfortune to eat a French fry potato heated in a
microwave oven will know that it is a generally soggy and faintly unpleasant
experience. We recently worked together on the problem of making a microwave
heated French fry potato with a crispy texture. Taking an attractive looking
French fry out of a microwave and hearing it go crunch in my mouth definitely
made me go wow. How did we do it? Answer; we solved a contradiction. A patent
application has since been submitted.</p>
<b>
<p>3) Gecko Eyes</p>
</b>
<p>It would be very easy to catalogue dozens of solutions from the natural world
that have made me go �wow� this year. I shall restrict myself to two recent
favourites. The first is the gecko eye (actually, the gecko foot is probably
even more remarkable, but since I am involved in a patent using the wow I got
from this, I will stay with the eye).</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image221.gif" width="417" height="204"></p>
</font><font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 3: Eye of the Gecko</p>
</b></font>
<p>The gecko is remarkable in that it has been able to solve the problem of
achieving excellent depth of field vision (useful for catching prey in differing
light conditions) without the usual complicated mechanisms evolved by other
creatures with the same problem. Nature is constantly striving to maximise the
way it uses available resources. The gecko solves the vision capability versus
design complexity through a pupil design comprised of a segmented edge design -
Figure 3. In other words, it achieves better performance with less resources by
adding holes to its pupil. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>4) Bear Fur</p>
</b>
<p>The second natural wow example comes from the fur design evolved by several
species of bear. The bear has a number of contradictions to live with. Most
notable with respect to its fur is that it needs good insulation properties in
order to help maintain temperature when the animal is static, but when it is
expending lots of energy - for example when running - it needs to be able to get
rid of the heat it generates. As illustrated in Figure 4, the bear solves this
contradiction using a very simple yet elegant solution involving the way its fur
is profiled. In simple terms, each individual fur fibre is profiled so that it
has a greater diameter at certain positions than it does at the root. The
consequence of this shape is that a) it tends to �bounce� when the bear runs
(next time you see pictures of a bear running you might like to notice the way
its fur moves), and b) the combination of shape plus movement creates the effect
of a pump. This pump serves to move warm air adjacent to the animal�s skin out
into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>5) Minority Report</p>
</b>
<p>Minority Report is a recent science-fiction film based on a story by Philip
Dick. The film, like Dick�s stories, is crammed full of details. One of the
details I particularly liked was the mass-customised, holographic advertisement
that appeared to the hero as he was walking in a shopping street. The hologram
knew all about the hero�s background and was able to recommend a purchase that
fitted with the background; the hologram was effectively walking along with the
hero, talking to him (presumably in a form and voice that it knew the hero
liked) while all the time being unseen and unheard by other people in the
street. This was one of those moments where it felt like you instinctively knew
that although this wasn�t possible to do using today�s technology, once a couple
of mass-customization (Reference 2) and technical challenges (contradictions!)
are solved, you know that someone, somewhere would make it happen.</p>
<b>
<p>6) Hot Rats</p>
</b>
<p>�Wow� moments in popular music tend to be few and far between these days.
People like John Coltrane and Frank Zappa tend to be two artists, on the other
hand, that have learned the secret of producing such moments on a relatively
frequent basis. Tracks like Peaches en Regalia and The Gumbo Variations from
Frank Zappa�s album Hot Rats offer excellent examples of �wows� that result from
taking musical conventions (for example the rules that say that only certain
notes should follow other notes, or that there should be regularity and
consistency of time intervals) and turning them upside down. This
convention-busting is again all about breaking contradictions - taking
established rules that say you can follow this note with any of these but not
those and then ignoring them while simultaneously still managing to make great
music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font><b>
<p>All Models Are Wrong�</p>
</b>
<p>�but some are useful. In other words, it is not about whether the exciter
hypothesis is right or not (actually it is probably neither - with �incomplete�
most likely to be the best description of its current state), it is about
whether it delivers tangible benefit. The main and to all intents and purposes
only point of this article is to implant the suggestion that customer �exciters�
are systematically achievable; that we can systematically �Design for
<font COLOR="#ff0000">W</font><font COLOR="#00ff00">o</font><font COLOR="#0000ff">w</font>�.
</p>
<p>We can do this through the successive identification and elimination of
conflicts and contradictions. </p>
<p>The Contradictions part of TRIZ offers the means of delivering precisely this
kind of systematic contradiction elimination.</p>
<p>�Design for <font COLOR="#ff0000">W</font><font COLOR="#00ff00">o</font><font COLOR="#0000ff">w</font>�
is contradiction elimination.</p>
