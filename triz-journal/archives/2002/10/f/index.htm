<p>TRIZ and Synoptics</p>
</b>
<p>This paper introduces Synoptics, an approach to creativity, in the context of
six challenges to creativity. Readers familiar with TRIZ and other substantial
creativity methods will see familiar themes. By looking at the approaches to
deal with these challenges we see the themes of metaphor and tree structures
that lie at the foundations of creative thought.</p>
<p>Synoptics was developed from a desire to understand the nature of existing
creativity methods, asking: why do we have the current methods? how are they
related? what other potential methods exist? TRIZ (Altshuller, 1984) played a
vital role, being the most developed of existing methods. Similar to other
methods TRIZ<sup>1</sup> has its roots in a simple metaphor of thinking. The
richness of TRIZ's elaboration of the metaphor pointed me to the potential of
the general approach of drawing from metaphors of thinking. This was a major
step in the development of Synoptics.</p>
<b>
<p>Overview</p>
</b>
<p>Even though we can recognize creativity in action, we find it difficult to
do. One reason creativity may be so difficult is that the underlying challenges
involved are not easily understood. This paper explores six of the central
challenges of creativity. We find two common themes, metaphoric models and tree
structures, that help to resolve these challenges.</p>
<p>We are concerned here with creativity as a problem solving process. Other
aspects of enhancing a person's general creative tendencies and enhancing an
environment to foster creativity are important, but by themselves are
insufficient towards a concerted effort against a specific problem. </p>
<p>The challenges below, clarify the issues of creativity. These challenges
motivated a research effort (Hyatt, 2000, 2001) that led to the creation of a
unifying framework called Synoptics. </p>
<p>We first look at these six challenges. Next, we look at how metaphoric models
and tree knowledge structures fit into the creativity process. We will then look
at the process as a whole and consider a possible end product for large-scale
problems that can involve many participants from different domains.</p>
<b>
<p>The six challenges</p>
</b>
<p>The six challenges of creativity are:</p>
<dir>
  <u>
  <p>Challenge 1.</u> How do we generate ideas that meet the opposing
  constraints of novelty and utility?</p>
</dir>
<p>We can define creativity as the generation of new and useful ideas. Both
aspects of the definition ('new' and 'useful') are constraints that must be
satisfied. Each is fairly easy to satisfy by itself. New ideas are easy to
generate by force fitting a characteristic from a randomly chosen concept to a
problem or issue (dictionaries readily serve the purpose of finding the random
concept). On the other hand, useful ideas are generated all of the time by
making incremental improvements to the existing idea (quality circles thrive on
this kind of activity). </p>
<p>More generally, ideas that will be useful tend to be similar to existing
ideas and ideas that are new tend to be very different to existing ideas. Thus
these two conditions are at odds with each other. The constraints can be
represented by regions of an idea space, as depicted in figure 1. At the center
of the figure are the existing ideas. The two constraints are represented by
distances from the existing ideas. Ideas that are unique tend to be distant from
the existing ideas, as represented outside of the inner circle. Useful ideas are
closer to existing ideas, represented as ideas within the outer circle. What we
have is a target that is defined by two circles representing the conflicting
requirements of novelty and utility. The width of the band between the two
circles depends on the conventionality of the existing ideas and the ease of
creating practical alternatives. Often these two leave little overlap and so we
have a narrow ring as a target. Satisfying these two conflicting requirements to
meet this narrow target is the first and fundamental challenge of creativity.</p>

</font>
<p align="left">Figure 1. The narrow band of creative ideas.</p>
<p>The narrow target of creativity will be missed if one is overly practical or
overly imaginative. A good creativity method will have a strong tendency to
reach this narrow target. This is difficult to achieve since creativity is an
abstract concept. Metaphoric mappings can translate abstract problems to common
ordinary processes. We will see that metaphors enable crafting tools to generate
ideas within the tight constraints of novelty and utility.</p>
<dir>
  <u>
  <p>Challenge 2.</u> How do we know when the full space of potential ideas has
  been generated?</p>
</dir>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Often one creative idea is not enough. Most of us have had
the experience of finding a creative solution only to find that someone else
finds an even better idea. We wonder why we did not come up with this improved
idea. One reason is that once someone finds one idea it is difficult to have the
same motivation to find other solutions. Perhaps part of the reason for this is
that we have little sense of the space of possibilities. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This space of possibilities is used in other disciplines. For
instance, in decision-making practice there is something called the 'wince
factor' to suggest direction. The wince factor is that part of the situation
that gives the maximum disturbance or discomfort. Similarly, in planning there
is the critical path that is the most important part of the plan to manage. In
both cases the focus is given by considering the entire space of possibilities.
It is difficult to know what to do or what to work on without knowing the full
space of possibilities. Indeed, how can one determine what the true problem is
without this space? The second challenge is motivated by finding the space of
potential ideas.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each creative method uses different techniques, so naturally
we want to use the method that will have the greatest impact. Unfortunately, the
methods have very little overlap and only span a small subset of the creativity
principles. Some creativity principles are not used in any of the mainstream
methods. To be assured of dealing with the most critical part we must have a
methodology that would span all possible creativity techniques. But to find a
complete set we must know what we do not know. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amazingly there is a solution, a way to infer the space of
techniques. The answer comes from recognizing that the approaches one can take
are based on what we can imagine or conceive. What we conceive is based on the
way we represent reality. Think about it this way. If we wanted to know all the
possible words one could make, it would be difficult to articulate them. But if
instead we recognize that all words are spelt by the same alphabet we can
construct the list of all possible words by generating all combinations of
letters. In our case, the principles are the words and the letters are the basic
elements of the representation. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we knew what we use to represent abstract reality we can
construct the set of all principles. Recent work in cognitive science point to
metaphor as that basic element to represent reality. As Lakoff puts it, &quot;To
study metaphor is to be confronted with hidden aspects of one's own mind and
one's own culture. ... To do so is to discover that one has a world view, that
one's imagination is constrained, and that metaphor plays an enormous role in
shaping one's everyday understanding of everyday events&quot;. (Lakoff, 1992) The
research points to a small set of metaphors that we use to describe reality.
They are in essence wisdom's alphabet from which we can construct a basic set of
principles of thought. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second challenge of creativity is to completely cover the
idea space. This requires knowing what you do not know. To choose the right
principle we must have all the possible creativity principles to choose from.
There is a myriad number of sets of creativity principles, but none of them are
complete. But without completeness there is no way to assure finding and
applying the critical principle. The key insight is that all of the principles
are rooted in metaphor. Since our conceptions are based on a small number of
these metaphors, if we examine the principles derived from these metaphors we
have a complete coverage of the possible conceptions. This approach to
creativity is called synoptic because it takes a comprehensive view. Only with a
complete approach are we assured that we will meet the real problem and not
merely a superfluous aspect of the problem.</p>
<dir>
  <u>
  <p>Challenge 3.</u> How can we develop or refine creativity techniques and
  practice?</p>
</dir>
<p>Even with a complete set of principles there are two things we would like to
be able to do. First, the principles span the space of ideas and provide a map
of what can be done, this map has the high level detail. We want to be able to
zoom in on the map, expanding or refining the repertoire of tools that can be
assembled against a problem. Second, we want to extend the practice of the
different ways we use the tools. We have been assuming that the creativity
process is being applied against an existing problem. Other forms of practicing
creativity can be imagined. For example, we might want to proactively anticipate
problems and deal with them beforehand or we might want to improve the existing
circumstances without reference to a problem. We might also want to identify
what creativity approach is most likely to resolve a stated problem rather than
exhaustively go through every approach. </p>
<p>The third challenge is how can we meet these two needs of expanding the
techniques and extending the practice to other forms of application. Again we
will turn to the use of the metaphoric models to point the way to these
extensions.</p>
<dir>
  <u>
  <p>Challenge 4</u> How do we ask the right questions?</p>
</dir>
<p>Often the most difficult part of solving a problem is to properly define it.
Sometimes the act of defining the problem determines the answer. Even when this
is not the case, a clear definition helps to understand where to focus the
thinking. A problem can often have one or more logical equivalents. If any one
of the problem statements yields a solution, the problem is solved. Also a
logical specification of the problem can involve a decomposition, which can help
to isolate the critical feature of the problem. </p>
<p>The fourth challenge is to represent the problem in a way that helps to
identify what the real problem is so that the right questions can be asked. The
logic tree was developed to meet these needs. It is a representation of the
problem requirements, options, and difficulties, to specify a clear and complete
definition of the problem.</p>
<dir>
  <u>
  <p>Challenge 5.</u> How can one manage the explosion of knowledge and channel
  it into potential solutions?</p>
</dir>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of creativity is matching up the problem with an already
existing solution. Rarely, does an answer come in a form that is radically new.
It is usually some novel modification or combination that is distinctly new.
This highlights the need to draw from existing sources of knowledge. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fifth challenge is how to navigate through this large
store of knowledge that is growing at an accelerating rate. The solution is the
same as any large indexing task, the principles are organized in a hierarchy or
classification tree. This old idea has new uses when used in conjunction with
the logic tree.</p>
<dir>
  <u>
  <p>Challenge 6.</u> How can one deal with the large number of possible
  alternatives that can be generated?</p>
</dir>
<p>By solving the other challenges, we can potentially generate a vast number of
alternative solutions. In order to have a complete approach, we may apply a
number of problem solving principles. In the process of meeting the challenge of
asking the right question, we may have a number of problem specifications again
multiplying the number of alternatives generated. Finally, in incorporating the
large number of potential solutions using a hierarchical index we again expand
the number of possible alternatives. Added to these basic multiplying factors to
generate alternative solutions, there are simple ways of generating solutions by
taking combinations of ideas. </p>
<p>The sixth challenge is to manage the multiplicity of alternatives that can be
generated. Again we turn to the use of trees to manage the large numbers.</p>
<p>In summary, for each of the six challenges, two tools have been proposed as
the solutions. We propose metaphoric models of thought to:</p>
<dl>
  <dd>1. meet the trade-off between novelty and utility. </dd>
  <dd>2. achieve completeness of creative approaches.</dd>
  <dd>3. extend the creativity tools and practice. </dd>
</dl>
<p>We propose tree structures to:</p>
<dl>
  <dd>4. ask the right questions.</dd>
  <dd>5. search the large number of potential ideas.</dd>
  <dd>6. manage the number of alternatives.</dd>
</dl>
<p>We now take a closer look at two tools that answer these six challenges,
metaphoric models and tree structures.</p>
<b>
<p>Metaphoric models</p>
</b>
<p>The first three challenges all deal with the nature of creativity. The key to
these riddles is how we represent creativity. Like other disciplines we employ
models as a representation. Unlike formal disciplines like physics and economics
that use mathematical models, the models to reason about creativity are more
subtle. Thinking is conceived in terms of metaphoric models. Creativity is one
application of these metaphoric models of thought.</p>
<p>We actually make extensive use of metaphoric models. In fact, we use
metaphors to structure many of the most critical aspects of our concepts of
reality including causality, time, identity, ethics, life, as well as thought. A
metaphorical model is a mapping from one domain to another. For example, we can
conceive of thinking as moving. </p>
</p><ul>
  <li>problem solving is moving from our current state of knowledge to a desired
  state of knowledge</li>
  <li>the current state of knowledge is our location</li>
  <li>the desired state of knowledge is the destination</li>
  <li>the set of ideas or options is the space in which one can move</li>
  <li>difficulties are obstacles in moving</li>
  <li>constraints are boundaries</li>
  <li>the approach we take is the direction</li>
  <li>attempts to improvements are paths</li>
  <li>the solution is a complete path from the start to the destination</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike analogies which make strict comparisons, metaphors are fluid. We can
use all types of modifications to express characteristics particular to
thinking. For example, if we are taking advantage of someone else's thought
process, we are following them. Someone with a good thinking ability is quick.
</p>
<p>Metaphors consolidate wisdom. This is because metaphors are prototypical
examples that apply over the widest set of circumstances. When one metaphor does
not work we adopt another. But typically a few will span most circumstances.
Since systems of principles and techniques are derived from the metaphors, a
familiarity with the metaphors gives direct access to the wisdom instead of a
second hand use through the techniques.</p>
<p>Now let us look at the first challenge. How do we generate ideas that are
both new and useful. To a limited extent this problem has been solved from
methods that already exist. Somehow they have a tendency to produce ideas that
fall within the narrow target of being both new and useful. But how do they do
it, and what can be done to generalize this capability?</p>
<p>The answer is that the methods draw from new and useful acts within the
metaphoric models of thought. For example, one of the leading creativity methods
is de Bono's Lateral Thinking. The idea of Lateral Thinking is that problems are
the result of obstacles. To get to the destination we must change from a direct
approach to taking an unexpected direction that moves us around the obstacle.
This act is using the Thinking is Moving metaphoric model in a way that is both
new and useful. </p>
<p>The resolution to the first challenge is to use techniques that satisfy a new
and useful action within a metaphor i.e. within a model of thought. This points
us to the narrow target of methods that produce new and useful ideas. </p>
<p>To resolve the second challenge of creativity, spanning the space of creative
alternatives, we must know what the set of metaphoric models of thinking are.</p>
<p>The results of an extensive survey (Hyatt, 2000), showed that the creativity
methods correspond to one of three metaphoric models: 'Thinking is Perceiving',
'Thinking is Moving', and 'Thinking is Manipulating Objects'. The creativity
acts for each creativity method correspond to a new and useful act described
within the metaphor. </p>
<p>In addition to surveying the methods of creativity, the conceptions of
creativity were also surveyed. The sources were:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Statements from creative individuals</li>
  <li>Writings pertaining to creative methods</li>
  <li>Statements from computational approaches to creativity</li>
  <li>Linguistic studies of metaphor used in ordinary discourse</li>
  <li>Polysemys, words that have multiple but <i>related</i> meanings (polysemys
  are good indicators of metaphor)</li>
  <li>Etymological polysemy, different words that have a common root word that
  was a polysemy</li>
  <li>Statements describing creativity across different cultures </li>
</ul>
<p>In each case the evidence pointed to using one or more of the three basic
metaphoric models of thought.</p>
<p>It is this universal applicability within this small set of three metaphors
that solves the second challenge of creativity, generating the full set of
potential ideas. By knowing the full space of possible approaches, namely the
new and creative acts within the three metaphors we can now actually bound the
space of idea-producing techniques. </p>
<p>The three primary metaphors complement each other. The perceiving metaphor
deals with representing and synthesizing information. It also deals with
illusion and identifying additional perspectives. Its strength is in problem
definition and defining the solution space. The thinking is moving metaphor
deals with transforming a problem to another. Essentially, the metaphor is a
model of a search process. The model effectively deals with sequencing,
obstacles, alternatives, and problem linkages. The thinking is object
manipulation metaphor deals with restructuring issues, how ideas interact and
how they combine, whether they are compatible, interfering, or connected. </p>
<p>Most creativity methods draw only from one aspect of one of the metaphoric
models. Even the best of the methods has at most three principles in its
repertoire. The strength of these methods is that they are very good at
exploiting one or two principles. We saw that de Bono's Lateral Thinking (de
Bono, 1971) draws from the 'Thinking is Moving' metaphor. Similarly, in TRIZ,
Altshuller's separation principle (Altshuller, 1984) is the foundation for many
original key TRIZ practices, draws from the 'Thinking is Object Manipulation'
metaphor. Adams' perceptual rules (Adams, 1963) are an example of a creativity
method drawing from the 'Thinking is Perceiving metaphor'. Elaborations of these
same metaphors have been described in the TRIZ journal (Mann, 2002; Pahl, 2002).
By drawing on all of the three metaphors, Synoptics has all existing principles
combined with newly discovered ones directly from the metaphors to have 10 to 20
times as many principles as many of the best methods. In addition, the metaphors
can be drawn from directly to find principles that are customized to the
problem. This is how some of the most powerful principles have been discovered.</p>
<p>This creation of additional principles is part of the resolution of the third
challenge, to create new creativity techniques. The other part of the resolution
is to use the metaphoric models in other ways to expand the practice of
creativity. </p>
<p>New techniques are derived from drawing from the metaphoric models for new
and useful acts. Variations of the metaphors are especially fruitful areas for
new principles. If we consider metaphoric models as a map, the three primary
metaphors of thinking are like continents in a map of the world. Refinements of
the metaphor are like regions. The finer the refinement the smaller the area.
For example, a refinement of the perceiving metaphoric model is the manner of
perceiving. Variation in the refinement puts us in a different place in the
metaphor map. Cultures can use different metaphors<sup>2</sup>. For example,
Western methods draw from metaphors of seeing. In the Eastern world methods draw
from metaphors of hearing. The difference gives rise to entirely different
approaches not commonly found in Western approaches to creativity.</p>
<p>New practices are derived from using the metaphoric models in new ways. We
have seen that the techniques come from looking for new and useful acts within
the metaphor. In the thinking is moving metaphor a new and useful act is taking
a shortcut<sup>3</sup>. Another way to use the metaphor is to look for ways to
avoid entrenched ways of thinking sometime called psychological inertia.
Psychological inertia corresponds to standard actions in the metaphor such as
always going in the straight direction. Another question we can ask is what
indicators might exist to help us identify the technique to use. In this case we
ask what in the metaphor indicates a new and useful act. In our case, a
misaligned situation metaphorically corresponds to a winding path indicates the
potential existence of a short cut. A third way to extend the practice is to
project what the ultimate solution might be of a long line of creative
improvements. If we could anticipate the ultimate solution we could move right
to it. This includes evolutionary trends and ideality in the practice of TRIZ.
In the moving metaphor, the ideal path is a straight path which extends from the
current situation to the objective. The metaphoric models are a fountainhead to
continually expand and refine creativity techniques and create significant
extensions to the practice of creativity. </p>
<b>
<p>Knowledge Tree Structures</p>
</b>
<p>The last three challenges all deal with managing large amounts of knowledge.
Challenge four is about the multiple ways of representing the problem and the
potential types of solution. Challenge five is about the vast reservoirs of
knowledge that could be used. Challenge six is about navigating through the
different alternatives to be creative and to solve the problem. In each case, by
using a tree structure we can manage these large quantities of representations,
alternative approaches, and domain knowledge that can lead to solutions. </p>
<p>Trees help to isolate solutions through a systematic search through the
branches; they also facilitate including large knowledge bases by adding
branches. To better appreciate the significance of tree structures consider two
other approaches, lists and flowcharts. Lists do not capture the interrelations
between the ideas. Usually when lists are generated, creativity is manifested in
the transition from one idea to the next. Often this transition branches to
multiple ideas, but only one is captured in the list. A great deal of effort can
be saved by thinking in terms of a tree structure and focusing on the fruitful
branches and eliminating the unfruitful.</p>
<p>Flowcharts are another approach that is similar to trees, in which a series
of questions guide one through a series of branch points. This approach seems to
overcome the shortfall of lists of having no branch points. For routine
problems, not demanding creativity, flowcharts work fine. However, these same
static questions in flowcharts inhibit the generation of new ideas for creative
thinking. The simple tree structure is the best of both worlds maintaining large
numbers of ideas through branching yet having the flexibility to add new ideas.</p>
<p>Trees are used extensively in creativity practice, notably in FAST (Bytheway;
Akiyama, 1989), mind mapping (Buzan, 1990), and the theory of constraints (Goldratt,
1990). Our discussion makes two contributions. First, trees use different
logics, each drawing from one of the three different metaphors (a complete
discussion goes beyond the scope of this paper). The logic tree integrates these
types of logic together. Second, the three trees discussed can be integrated
together into a knowledge map.</p>
<p>We now look at the ways that tree structures can be used to solve the
remaining three challenges. The logic tree resolves the fourth challenge by
managing the problem representation. Ontologies, hierarchical knowledge bases,
resolve challenge five to search through potential solutions. A hierarchy of
creativity principles resolves challenge six. These three structures are
integrated into a knowledge map.</p>
<u>
<p>Logic Trees</p>
</u>
<p>In the process of developing Synoptics, the patterns of logic in problem
solving also emerge. Logic plays an important role in both isolating critical
questions and managing the multiplicity of ideas. Logic provides a framework for
the creative process to work in. </p>
<p>Problem solving is like working through a maze. One can try to visually find
the path, but marking the maze to trace the path makes finding the solution much
easier. This is because </p>
<dl>
  <dd>1) untried options are easily identified, </dd>
  <dd>2) entire branches can be eliminated, and </dd>
  <dd>3) multiple paths can be explored in parallel working on the most
  promising, but alternating as appropriate </dd>
</dl>
<p>In problem solving it is similarly important to try to trace the development
of ideas. The traces in the paths of the logic trees has parallel benefits: </p>
<dl>
  <dd>1) unexplored options can be tracked, </dd>
  <dd>2) related ideas can be eliminated by their common branch, and </dd>
  <dd>3) multiple ideas can be developed in parallel often lending to forming a
  solution drawing form several lines of thinking.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The logic tree represents logical equivalencies of different problem
statements. The tree starts with a problem statement. Moving up the tree, each
level is an equivalent statement that provides the motivation or cause of the
problem. Moving down the tree are equivalent statements that provide the
implementation of the problem. These equivalencies are specified in logical
terms by necessary and sufficient conditions. </p>
<p>The logic tree has met several challenges in creative problem solving. The
primary purpose of the logic tree is to resolve challenge four to isolate the
right problem and ask the right questions. The tree structure also deals with
two other central challenges. For the many alternatives generated, the logic
tree can help branch and bound solutions or design space. The tree structure
also facilitates drawing from hierarchical knowledge bases, greatly enlarging
the number of alternatives that are considered.</p>
<u>
<p>Ontologies</p>
</u>
<p>A knowledge hierarchy arranged from general categories to specific is called
an ontology. Ontologies have had a long history in philosophical thought to
study the nature of things. Ontological knowledge hierarchies have received a
renewed interest with the desire to maintaining organizational knowledge and
creating standards of communication. Ontologies are also compatible with the
tree structure of the logic tree. In the solution process, a stored ontology can
be retrieved to add hundreds of alternatives, which can be immediately added to
a problem's logic tree. </p>
<p>Searching for ideas and generating a complete set of alternative ideas is
difficult. Ontologies can be especially helpful in meeting this fifth challenge.
By developing ontologies of solutions over time, we will have a representation
that incorporates experience developed from solving other problems, and added to
in previous creativity efforts. The ontology of solutions becomes a master
reference source. A complete approach to creativity is much easier with such a
comprehensive ontology.</p>
<p>Currently, six ontologies have been developed:</p>
<dl>
  <dd>1. Technologies - we pay particular attention to technology because of its
  rapid growth and since it is the basic source of solutions for many problems.</dd>
  <dd>2. Emerging technologies - these are called out in that they are a rich
  source of untried solutions. Identifying them separately accelerates the
  adoption of good ideas.</dd>
  <dd>3. Physical effects - this is useful in cases where a needed device does
  not exist, one can turn to first principles. (Software packages such as
  Ideation's Innovation WorkBench and Invention Machine's TechOptimizer do
  something similar).</dd>
  <dd>4. Alternative problem frames - unlike the other ontologies this one is
  used early in the process and provides a way of rapidly identifying the most
  helpful frame for the problem out of the many possible. </dd>
  <dd>5. Standard solutions - the TRIZ methodology of looking at abstract ways
  of structuring problems can be put into a hierarchy (Royzen, 1998).</dd>
  <dd>6. Vulnerability and threats - this is the inverse of the problem solving,
  namely determining what problems might arise or how to create a problem for
  someone else.</dd>
</dl>
<u>
<p>Managing the alternatives and the hierarchy of creative principles</p>
</u>
<p>We are now at a state in which we can generate many alternatives from looking
at different problem representations, stored solutions, and the drive towards a
complete set of creativity principles. The sixth challenge is to manage this
multiplicity of alternatives. Using a tree structure will get us there. </p>
<p>With the logic tree and the ontologies we almost have everything structured
in a tree, but not quite. The logic tree gives the different ways of
representing the problem that starts the process and the ontologies give the
ways to implement the solution to finish the process. In between are the
principles of creativity. They are used to build the logic tree to get to the
point of searching for specific implementations. We now need to put these
principles into a tree and we will be done.</p>
<p>Again we turn to the metaphoric models of thought. These metaphoric models
provide the most generic, abstract prototype problems. This is why the solution
principles of these simple situations apply to so many other problems and
describe the space of creative principles. </p>
<p>The metaphoric models provide a basis for organizing the creative principles.
The key is to organize them in a tree structure so that we can treat the
principles in batches according to the branches, as well as finding applicable
principles by indexing down through the branches. Such a tree can be built
because some metaphors are more abstract and general than others. For example, a
variety of characteristics like hard, rigid, brittle can be described by a rock.
As soon as we want to bring in aspects of growth or a system we have to use a
living thing for the metaphor. If we want to describe behavior metaphorically we
want to use something from the animal kingdom. Such considerations lead to
creating a hierarchy of metaphors arranged according to generality. By mapping
the creativity principles to the most general metaphor possible we have the
hierarchy of creative principles that we want.</p>
<b>
<p>Benefits</p>

<p>Before looking at the process of integrating the logic tree, creativity
techniques and ontologies we review the advantages of these three tools. </p>
<dir>
  <u>
  <p>Managing the multiplicity of ideas</u>. For all three tools by working with
  entire branches large numbers of alternatives can be easily added or
  eliminated. </p>
</dir>
<u>
<p>Uses of the logic tree</p>
<dir>
  </u>
  <p>� <u>The logic tree isolates the critical question</u>:</p>
</dir>
<dl>
  <dd>- what is the real problem?</dd>
  <dd>- what is its linchpin? - most problems have them.</dd>
  <dd>- what knowledge to search for to find the solution?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Rather than relying on the obvious options, the logic tree isolates the
critical components of the problem so that the right questions can be asked and
the needed information sought after. The logic tree compensates for any lack of
expertise by identifying the critical areas of the problem, which supplemental
research can be conducted to get the needed knowledge.</p>
<dir>
  <p>� <u>Find problem equivalencies</u>. The logic tree transforms the problem
  into a logically equivalent one that may be more tractable.</p>
  <p>� <u>Increase number of alternatives</u> Experience shows that an
  unorganized approach generates only a fraction of alternatives are found when
  the logic tree is used. The logic tree locates points to look for other
  alternatives: branch points, breaking into subfunctions, or intermediate
  levels. Finding intermediate levels is an especially good way to find
  overlooked alternatives. Levels are like hidden questions that are a problem
  transformation or another level of abstraction. </p>
</dir>
<u>
<p>Framework of the logic tree</p>
</u>
<dl>
  <dd>� <u>Compatible with hierarchical knowledge bases</u> The tree structure
  naturally absorbs other tree structures. Predefined trees of potential
  solutions can immediately be attached to the logic tree to add many
  alternatives effortlessly. </dd>
  <dd>� <u>Compatible with creativity principles hierarchy</u> Since the logic
  tree was developed from the same models as Synoptics the logic tree serves as
  the platform for the Synoptic creativity process. </dd>
  <dd>� <u>Communication and collaboration</u> The logic tree serves as a
  communication tool in which all participants can share the same representation
  of the problem. </dd>
  <dd>� <u>Organizational memory</u> Knowledge can be maintained over periods of
  time preventing loss from either neglect or from being buried in a mountain of
  information. The logic tree is a clear record of what has been tried and what
  were the difficulties. Furthermore, knowledge can be structured for reuse on
  other problems. </dd>
</dl>
<p>Logic trees are extremely powerful as a systematic procedure in developing
solutions. No other method that was surveyed is as comprehensive, integrated,
and systematic. </p>
<b>
<p>The process and the end product</p>
</b>
<p>The end product is a fully developed logic tree that serves as a <i>knowledge
map</i> of the space of potential solutions. This knowledge map is a synthesis
of the three tree structures: 1) the logic tree, 2) the creativity techniques,
and 3) ontologies. </p>
<p>The process of building the knowledge map begins with the initial
construction of the logic tree. This is a logical specification of the problem,
downward extending branches give the necessary and sufficient conditions. The
tree is constructed upward by referencing the context of the problem, i.e. 'why
is this a problem?'. This can lead to alternative problems statements meeting
the same objectives. These alternatives lead to parallel branches of
alternatives. Earlier developed alternatives with their difficulties are also
added. Alternatives are generated from the creativity tools and from the
hierarchical knowledge bases. Gaps of knowledge are filled in through archival
search and interviewing experts. Participants observe the development of the
tree, making suggestions and discussing differing points of view until reaching
a consensus.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 2. The process to build the knowledge map</p>
<p>The high levels of a knowledge map define the problem and identify the major
alternatives and issues to its solution. The next levels of the knowledge map
are more detailed and use more expert knowledge. The branches include all there
is to know about the subject in terms of options. Working down the knowledge
map, these branches explicate the way to achieve the problem's objective from
broad categories of alternatives down to specific details. Because these
objectives may be useful to solving other problems, these branches in the
knowledge map can be stored for later use. </p>
<p>With the knowledge map, large networks of individuals can collaborate on
problems. Knowledge can be maintained over periods of time preventing loss from
either neglect or from being buried in a mountain of information. The knowledge
map records past efforts, isolates difficulties, and identifies areas needing
further research. Cross references (hyperlinks) can denote sources. The full
space of potential opportunities are laid out for further development,
communication, and organizational memory. Furthermore, knowledge can be
structured for reuse on other problems. </p>
<p>The knowledge map is a natural tool for collaboration. It is not limited to a
local group. Using its ability to identify critical questions and problems it
can be used to focus research and track progress on parallel fronts. The
knowledge map can facilitate the synthesis of ideas that large problems require.
The pressing problems of our day, such as curing the major diseases, resolving
environmental problems, national security, dealing with limited energy, water
and other resources, and ending poverty and ignorance could be represented in
knowledge maps to focus an entire research community. These problems need a
focus on what the roots of the problems are, the diffuse and diverse expertise
needs a common forum, and these problems need creative approaches from the
distilled wisdom of all of the problem solving approaches available. </p>
<dl>
  <dd>� How many times has a path been halted because of a seemingly
  insurmountable obstacle only to prove to be on a solution path long after the
  obstacle quietly becomes an accepted but fallacious constraint? The knowledge
  map, represents and maintains the alternate paths providing constant reminders
  of other possible solutions. </dd>
  <dd>� How many times is the focus shifted from the critical problems to what
  is politically desirable? Again the knowledge map maintains a focus. </dd>
  <dd>� How many times are differing views forgotten in the details over time?
  The knowledge map maintains these views so there is no misunderstanding on the
  alternative perspectives of the problem.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In summary, knowledge maps promise to take creativity to a larger scale. They
can facilitate the collaboration of large communities. They can maintain focus
and record the essential aspect of a problem. Knowledge maps also facilitate the
use of ontologies, structured archives of expert knowledge. The knowledge map
becomes a representation of the problem that facilitates and enhances
creativity, communication, memory, and decision making.</p>
<b>
<p>Conclusion</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have two types of tools to advance creativity. Much has
been made of the differences of thinking between the two hemispheres of the
brain. Creativity is largely bringing these two types of thinking together. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The metaphoric models reveal the nature of creativity. They
provide the insights of what types of mental acts will generate creative ideas
and what the full space of these acts are. Metaphors provide the artistic medium
to form approaches to be creative.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tree structures enable a more analytic, logical form of
thinking that is the backbone of the creative process. The trees are the
scientific side of creativity. As in the brain, creativity is a marriage of
these two different thinking processes.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tools resolve six of the central challenges of
creativity, but the combining these two leaves enough mystery the process of
creativity will probably always be an intriguing process.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the mechanisms of creativity remain mysterious, we have
seen that we can make great progress in understanding and harnessing the
process. We need to get away from being overawed with creativity. Too often our
efforts are misused and misdirected. Too often we choose between bad
alternatives rather than putting our efforts into creating good alternatives.
Too often resources go towards speed when the direction is still not clear. More
than anyone else TRIZ practioners are aware that creativity has been too often
neglected as a mysterious gift that does not merit serious attention in our
designs. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hopefully the substantial methods such as TRIZ are changing
this perception. Synoptics is offered as an additional block in the foundation
of serious creativity that will help in its acceptance and use. Systematic
creative thinking is an extraordinary lever that can move difficult obstacles. I
think Isocrates, the ancient rhetorician said it best. He said that if every man
in Greece could lift twice as much, run twice as fast, jump twice as far, and so
on, the world would be little better off - animals and machinery do the fast and
heavy work anyway. But if just one man could think twice as clearly as anyone
does now, the whole world could be blessed forever after. (Norlin, 1968)</p>
