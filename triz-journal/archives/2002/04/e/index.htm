    <p>I have been learning and using TRIZ for over two years now and have often
    wondered why TRIZ is not being more widely used in the UK. I offer my
    thoughts below and would be very interested in the opinions of other
    readers. I should emphasise that I am a believer in TRIZ and so any negative
    points below are aimed at trying to increase the implementation of TRIZ.</p>
    <p><b>&quot;Fashion Fatigue&quot; </b> </p>
    <p>Over recent years industry has been bombarded with many initiatives which
    have proved costly and with little or no apparent benefit. Against this
    background &quot;Not another acronym&quot; or &quot;Not another initiative&quot; tends to be the
    response when people hear about TRIZ. My reply is that it can hardly be seen
    as the latest fad given its long history. However then can come the killer
    phrase of all killer phrases &quot;If TRIZ is such a good idea, why isn't
    everyone using it?&quot; The obvious response is that using that type of thinking
    you will never try anything new but it is a valid question.</p>
    <p><b>TRIZ Books</b></p>
    <p>Let us assume that the first barrier is overcome and that a person
    actually starts reading about TRIZ. I have been surprised at people saying
    how complicated TRIZ is. This is, I believe, because some TRIZ books are
    written to impress the writer's peers, not to explain to the lay reader
    (writing to impress not to express). I do not include Altshuller's books in
    this category - they are simple to understand and inspiring to read. However
    I find it amazing that &quot;And suddenly the inventor appeared.&quot; is described as
    a children's book. I have not tried my two children on it but doubt that
    they would cope with it. ( Another book I read a year or so ago with the
    word &quot;Introduction&quot; in the title I found extremely difficult. I would have
    been amazed if a new comer would have embarked on TRIZ having read that
    book).</p>
    <p><b>TRIZ Courses</b></p>
    <p>I believe that the easiest way by far to learn TRIZ is to attend a
    course. What appears complicated in print starts to make sense when
    explained in person and with a basic foundation then the TRIZ books start
    making sense. The trickiest time is once the course is over. Ideally the
    TRIZ initiate would return to work and start to use his new skills on real
    problems. This is easier said then done. He may return to a back log of work
    and it is quite easy for a few weeks to pass with no practice being carried
    out. What was once fresh in the mind is fading fast.....</p>
    <p>TRIZ is not a quick fix.</p>
    <p>A big barrier to TRIZ being introduced into a company is I believe that
    there is a need to practise the methods on real problems. It is unlikely
    that a person coming back from an introductory course will find enough
    problems <b>within his own area</b> to work on. He or she will need to help
    out / practise on other people's projects, in other departments to become
    proficient and that is not easy. Time constraints, company politics and a
    host of other obstacles mean that the skills are not practised and fall into
    disuse.</p>
    <p><b>&quot;We solved the problem but we didn't use TRIZ&quot;</b></p>
    <p>TRIZ does not leave fingerprints. Because it is based on simple
    techniques that have been used many times before the efficacy of TRIZ is
    hard to prove. Particularly because a good solution appears obvious. (See
    Darrel Mann's article-
    <a href="http://www.triz-journal.com/archives/2001/06/c/index.htm">http://www.triz-journal.com/archives/2001/06/c/index.htm</a>
    in which he talks of the irreversibility of a good idea). </p>
    <p>Any problem which is approached with the help of a TRIZ adviser needs the
    active help of the problem owners. And the very act of describing the
    problem to an outsider can perhaps help the problem owner to understand the
    problem better. Probably the biggest drawback is that TRIZ provides the
    direction of the solution but doesn't hand over a fully calculated solution.
    The problem owner, when presented with an answer from TRIZ will still have
    to do a certain amount of re-designing to carry out. If the solution works
    was it due to TRIZ or to the careful design of the new component?</p>
    <p>It is important therefore at the outset to explain that TRIZ can only be
    used in conjunction with expertise in a given field so that the solution
    comes from a <b>team effort</b>. It reminds me of a cynic's definition of a
    consultant - Someone who asks for your watch and tells you the time. (The
    even more cynical version states that he/she also keeps the watch). </p>
    <p><b>Problems, Problems, Problems</b></p>
    <p>Ironically one of the biggest problems of learning TRIZ is finding
    problems to work on. The people who have the most problems to solve are
    people in production who are too busy fire-fighting to step back and think,
    let alone learn a new technique. </p>
    <p><b>TRIZ aimed at operators not engineers?</b></p>
    <p>A possible solution to this is to aim a course at the shop floor
    operators. After all the concept of contradictions is very simple and none
    of the forty principles require a degree to understand. In addition they are
    the people who know all the problems. (This ties in very much with the
    Kaizen approach of going to the &quot;Gamba&quot;-the workplace). This might also help
    to break down the resistance of the engineers. The ideas generated by the
    team would have to be drawn up or designed by the engineers. The engineer
    would be happier helping out the operators rather than being told how to
    solve the problem by a consultant.</p>
    <p>In conclusion here is how I feel TRIZ should be approached.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>How to implement TRIZ</b></p>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Need to accept that the process will take a year
    at least.</li>
      <li>Important to involve one's best people - TRIZ
    will not turn a poor &quot;engineer&quot; into a good one. But it will turn a good one
    into an excellent one.</li>
      <li>Course in isolation is a waste of time. Further
    background reading will be required and follow up courses should be
    attended.</li>
      <li>Line up problems in advance - Instead of a
    Suggestion scheme run a Problem scheme to find out what problems could be
    worked on. The trainees must be given the authority to work on problems
    throughout the organisation.</li>
      <li>Make contact with other TRIZ practitioners and
    learn from them.</li>
</ul>
    <p>I would be very interested to hear other people's views on this article.</p>
