<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Abstract</b>. The process of introducing TRIZ into companies
normally starts with solving real production problems by involving TRIZ
consultants in this work. After significant results have been obtained and some
positive experience has been accumulated in this direction, the company�s
interest changes. A considerable interest arises in teaching the problem-solving
methods to the company�s employees. The purpose of such training is to improve
the technical level of all employees and to prepare a certain number of
high-skilled specialists in problem solving with the aid of TRIZ. This paper
describes our approach to the training of company�s employees, which is realized
with the aid of the online training system �TRIZ-trainer� developed and used at
SAMSUNG (South Korea). </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introduction.</b> Along with solving real production
problems, another important stage of introducing TRIZ into companies is training
of its employees. The main problem that usually arises in this connection is
deficiency of time. As least two weeks are needed for studying TRIZ at the
initial level, while the full-scale training course will take about two months.
For this period, every trainee must suspend performance of his daily functions,
which is not always possible. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can we resolve this situation by using TRIZ?</p>
</font>
<font FACE="Gulim" LANG="KO" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
</font><font size="2"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Training form.</b> There exist two basic forms of training -
seminars under the guidance of a teacher and training with the aid of computer
programs. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to Table 1, seminars held by an experienced teacher
are fairly efficient, but great time and money expenses per one employee make
this form of training inaccessible to most employees of a company. In addition,
the choice of students for such seminars is arbitrary, without considering
individual peculiarities. In this case, it is not always possible to select
employees who are really adequate for consulting work. The employee�s adequacy
or inadequacy for this kind work is often detected only after completing the
training course, when time and money have already been spent.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Training with the aid of computer programs practically does
not encroach upon the employees� working hours and does not require expenses.
With sufficient motivation, each employee may be trained independently during
rest periods or in his free time. However, the efficiency of such training is
not high, since computer programs do not take into account individual
peculiarities of trainees. A contradiction occurs between the training
efficiency and the time and money expenses for organizing the training process.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, we have two alternative training systems and we can
resolve the contradiction of this situation by combining these systems in
accordance with the methods proposed by S.Litvin and V.Gerasimov (1).</p>

Teacher�.</p>
</i></font><font FACE="Gulim" LANG="KO" SIZE="2">
</font><font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the combined training system, the basic information and
check tasks must be presented on electronic information carriers and must be
accessible to a trainee any time a day, for instance, through Internet or a
company�s intranet. A teacher receives and evaluates fulfilled check tasks. He
can also answer the arising questions and help a trainee perform, in the most
rational way, actions necessary for problem solving. In this case, personal
contact of a trainee and a teacher is unessential. Thus, the advantages of two
competing training systems are combined. </p>
</font><font FACE="Gulim" LANG="KO" SIZE="2">
</font><font size="2"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seminar or training?</b> Which method is more suitable for
our online system? </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generally speaking, there are two teaching methods. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first one - we�ll conventionally call it academic -
consists in that a full-scale theory of a subject is given to a trainee and then
the obtained knowledge is solidified by solving special training problems. This
requires much time and the presence of a teacher is essential. The purpose of
such teaching is to provide a student with knowledge that subsequently is
supplemented and solidified by permanent exercises. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second method is training. In this case, a trainee is
proposed to fulfill some action, while theoretical knowledge is attracted when
it is necessary and insofar as it is necessary. The example is training any
recurring action, for instance, driving a car or flying a plane. The purpose of
the training is to work out a skill of fulfilling this action. Further training
follows the path of deepening the theoretical knowledge essential for
understanding the meaning that is behind the fulfilled actions.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the purpose of the initial system is to provide a
student with problem-solving skills, training is more suitable for an online
system. </p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Structure</b>. To efficiently teach problem solving with the
aid of training, we must have a distinct problem solving structure. Then we can
repeat the solving process many times thus explaining and training the
peculiarities of performing each action. In real use of TRIZ, several approaches
to problem solving are employed (2, 3).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. In a random way</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this case, a problem is solved by that TRIZ tool, in terms
of which it is formulated. For instance, if the conditions of a problem seem to
contain a technical contradiction, then the solver will first of all look for a
method for resolving that contradiction. If the problem�s condition is described
through the interaction of two or more objects, standards or effects are used.
Such an approach allows for solving the problem but is inconvenient for teaching
since the information is dispersed about several sections of TRIZ. </p>

    <p>2. Using ARIZ</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>ARIZ offers a distinct problem-solving scheme, but its structure seems too
rigid and requires a prolonged preliminary study. Besides, ARIZ is a tool for
solving complex acute contradictions, which is not frequent in practice. </p>

    <p>3. Using main postulates of OTSM</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>The OTSM approach developed recently by N.Khomenko is more attractive in this
respect (4, 5). The narrowing, distinctly confined search area implies at the
same time a certain degree of freedom of actions within this area. </p>
<p>In addition, OTSM envisages actions in accordance with classical Cartesian
cognitive scheme - �transfer from a specific situation to its abstract models;
transformation of those models; building a specific solution�, which is more
comprehensible to engineers who received a traditional education. </p>

Fig. 4. Solving a problem in accordance with OTSM.</p>
</font><font FACE="Gulim" LANG="KO" SIZE="2">
</font></i><font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our approach is as follows. To develop the most suitable
structure of problem solving, it is expedient to combine OTSM with ARIZ
elements. This can be done by rigidly presetting several key points in the
solving process and allowing more or less free transfers between them. The
authors developed this structure on the basis of a multi-year experience in
solving real problems. The structure is elucidated by the �Christmas Tree�
diagram, which is described in detail in the January issue of the TRIZ journal  </font>(<a href="http://www.triz-journal.com/archives/2002/01/f/index.htm">http://www.triz-journal.com/archives/2002/01/f/index.htm</a>).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The training system �TRIZ-trainer� ensures a convenient
interaction between a trainee and a teacher through the communication section.
Owing to this, a trainee can ask any question at any moment, while a teacher has
an opportunity to evaluate the individual abilities of each student. This
structure allows a teacher to simultaneously control a group of students, while
students have an opportunity to permanently consult with their teacher whenever
they need. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, there is a glossary with short definitions of
notion used in TRIZ-trainer, and references to used and recommended literature
for self-improvement.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Structure of training the company�s employees. </b>The use of
the on-line training system �TRIZ-trainer� in addition to the traditional
methods (a series of successive seminars under the guidance of a teacher) allows
obtaining a number of advantages. A possibility appears to organize training of
the company�s employees in several stages, the complexity of the material being
increased from stage to stage (Fig. 10).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Practically all employees of a company can participate in the
first, initial stage of training conducted with the aid of the system �TRIZ-trainer�.
The students will get initial knowledge on TRIZ and problem-solving skills. At
this stage, a student can master the logic of building a solution by solving a
certain number of training problems. After the initial stage, the most capable
employees are selected and recommended for further training at seminars under
the guidance of a teacher. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the second stage, a student can improve his knowledge
obtained with the aid of TRIZ-trainer, thoroughly study the theoretical
foundations of TRIZ and have an in-depth practice at solving training and real
problems under the guidance of an experienced teacher. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final stage of training is probation of employees in
solving real problems under the guidance of an experience TRIZ consultant. At
this stage, one can achieve a deeper understanding of the theoretical basics of
problem solving and acquire practical skills in identifying and solving the
problems available in a real production situation. One can learn to make a
purposeful search for information while working with the specialists of a
customer�s team and work out the skills to evaluate and select the best solution
for a given situation. </p>
