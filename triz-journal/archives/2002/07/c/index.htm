<p>In order to realize an accident-free situation, the airline industry has made
various efforts. Recently, the industry followed the approach from the aspects
of psychology and behavioral science aiming at reduction of human errors. This
approach, however, has produced results in terms of occurrence prevention, but
is not enough from a perspective of recurrence prevention. Introducing TRIZ here
helps the airline industry to realize an accident prevention measure, including
an entire flight system, in order to establish a system for analyzing causes of
an accident and preventing their recurrence. This paper will discuss the case
where the TRIZ methodology was applied to human error prevention training in the
airport management division of Airline A.</p>

<p>The number of commercial aircraft flights<sup><a href="#1" name="1a">*1</a></sup> in 2000 worldwide was 21.20
million with a total flight time of 38.20 million hours, increased by 11.5% and
8.3% respectively from the previous year. The number of passengers transported
was 2,017 million, a 6.6% increase. Although there is a temporary reduction due
to special circumstances, it is anticipated that this upward trend will not
change in the future. On the other hand, the direct damages by accidents<sup><a href="#2" name="2a"><font FACE="MS Mincho" LANG="JA">*</font>2</a></sup>
are assumed to be $550 million, and the total amount of damages including
compensations to passengers and damages by small accidents to be $1,668 million.
It is needless to say that prevention of accidents not only leads to a sales
increase due to improvement of reliability from the aspect of safety, but also
is one of the major management challenges due to its serious influence of
accidents on financial items.</p>

    <font FACE="Arial"><b>
    <p>1.2. Overview of Aircraft Accidents</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</b></font>
<p>The history of aircraft consists of struggles in accident prevention. Even
now the world airline companies make various efforts to prevent occurrence of
accidents.</p>
<p>During the period of 43 years from 1958, the flights of jet airplanes made
numbered 393 million for 634 million hours in total, with 800 total-loss
accidents having occurred. Among these, 630 accidents occurred during flight. If
this is analyzed by the rate of total-loss accidents per 1 million flights, the
number of accidents decreases: 5.28 accidents for 43 years; 1.34 for the past 20
years; 1.27 for the past 10 years; and 1.11 for the past five years.</p>
<p>This dramatic improvement greatly owes to performance improvement of the
aircraft body and development of radio navigation. At present, it is not
possible to say that the accidents during flights can be eliminated, but the
major causes of the accidents have been changed. <i>IATA Safety Report (JET)
2000</i> indicates that the causes of the current accidents are [1] human error
factors (30%), [2] organizational factors (25%), [3] environmental (weather)
factors (24%), and [4] technical factors (20%). Accordingly the actions to
prevent accidents have been changing from those in the technical aspect of
aircraft and navigation to those against human error and organizational factors.</p>
<dir>

    <font FACE="Arial"><b>
    <p>1.3. What are Human Errors?</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</b></font>
<p>M.S. Sanders and E.J. McCormick, US ergonomists, defined human error as �an
inappropriate or undesirable human decision or behavior that reduces, or has the
potential for reducing, effectiveness, safety, or system performance.� There are
other several significant definitions, and thus it can simply say �a general
term for errors caused by human decisions and behaviors.�</p>

</b></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left">
<img SRC="Image151.gif" width="552" height="316"></p>
</font>
<p>The important point here is the fact that human decisions and behaviors are
constantly influenced by natural characteristics of human beings as a living
thing as well as tools and machinery, facilities, environment and other people
involved in the course of conducting their jobs. From this perspective, so far
the prevention of human errors has been approached mainly by understanding
human�s natural characteristics -- the core of the system constructing jobs --
from the perspectives of psychology and behavior science. The focus here is to
understand the mechanism of an error caused by human factors in the sequence
from human�s input = perception/recognition; intermediate process =
judgment/decision-making; to the output process = operation, as shown in Figure
1, and not to generate such an error.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <font FACE="Arial"><b>
    <p>1.4. Approach to Human Error Prevention</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</b></font>
<p>The airline industry has already developed the CRM (Crew Resource Management)
training program, which is a training approach mainly from the perspectives of
physiology and behavior science and engaged in reduction of human errors by
pilots. However, in order to improve safety of current operations supported by a
quite complicated system, it was recognized that the training only of pilots was
not enough and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) decided to mandate
the CRM training in 1995 as well as expanding the applicable personnel for the
training (e.g., dispatchers and cabin attendants).</p>
<p>In Japan the Civil Aviation Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure
and Transport also established the legislation for the CRM training. At present,
the airlines have gradually expanded the training scope to cover dispatchers and
cabin attendants in addition to pilots.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <font FACE="Arial"><b>
    <p>1.5. Improvement of Conventional Approach</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</b></font>
<p>The conventional approach to the prevention of human errors from the
perspectives of psychology and behavior science worked very well on reduction of
aircraft accidents. This approach, however, is not sufficient from the two
points.</p>
<p>First of all, an approach from psychology and behavior science is reasonable
from the viewpoint of occurrence prevention, but it tends to put too much
emphasis on mentality, thus leaving doubt in terms of recurrence prevention. In
other words, the experience of an accident accompanying huge sacrifice can be
capitalized only as recognizing anew the significance of human errors.</p>
<p>This is because an accident caused by technical factors of aircraft often
left physical evidences, but for human errors although it is possible to assume
behavior condition, it does not have accuracy as firm physical evidences. What�s
more, the reason why the person took that action causing the accident cannot be
explained easily.</p>
<p>In order to determine that human error caused the accident, it is necessary
to prove that proactively. But in reality while the cause is still vague, it is
determined that the accident was caused by the human error just because a human
was there. This kind of ambiguous treatment makes capitalization and recurrence
prevention difficult. </p>
<p>Secondly, as the above-mentioned IATA Report stated, there are four major
factors, which hinder safety. But as only human errors are treated as an
independent object from other three factors, the linkage as a whole systems is
weak. Investigation reports of aircraft accidents well demonstrate the
difficulty of identifying one cause of the accident. In most accidents, factors
are overlapped and it is quite difficult to determine which is a main cause and
which is a secondary cause. For example, if any mechanical equipment failed
first and then a pilot could not take any action against it, which is a main
cause? Originally, whichever the main cause or secondary cause, action must be
taken. But because the relationship between the human error and accident is
stressed too much, this approach has potential risk that the cause of the
accident is distorted as simply a problem of the individual and disturbs the
progress of recurrence prevention measures, which are the essential objective of
the investigation of the accident.</p>
<p>F.H. Hawkins of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, who established the basis of the
CRM training, already explained the importance of the entirety mainly the mutual
relationships among the factors using the SHELL model. However, although the
SHELL model is excellent in terms of explaining the importance of the entirety,
it leans relatively to the pilot position and lacks concreteness from the
perspective of the whole organization. </p>
<p>Consequently, connecting the current approach mainly using psychology and
behavior science to the entire system naturally is an important perspective for
preventing accidents through prevention of human errors.</p>

<p>Figure 2 is the Structure of Factors for Accident Prevention prepared by
Tadashi Watanabe<sup><a href="#3" name="3a">*3</a></sup> and modified by the author. In this illustration, the bold
frames are the elements of the approaches to human errors in the conventional
CRM training program, and when considering accident prevention, this
illustration clearly shows that they are not independent. There are factors
related to technology, procedures and organizational structure, and together
with human error factors, they are entangled as the main and secondary causes.
Thus, it is quite obvious that all the factors should be examined together and
measures to prevent accidents including the linkage of the factors should be
taken in the future accident prevention.</p>

    <p>2.1. Airport Management Division of Company A</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</font></b>
<p>The airport management division provides support to aircraft operations and
performs all the handling services. Especially the station control, in order to
realize arrival and departure in accordance with the schedule, must determine
airplane parking locations, control weight of passenger cargo, provide
information on the aircraft body and the latest route, supply fuel based on a
flight plan approved by the pilot, instruct the passengers boarding and
alighting, check the maintenance situation and adjust the time, upon
coordination with a dispatcher as well as the passenger, cargo and maintenance
divisions, within the time from arrival to departure of the aircraft (maximum:
about 50 minutes for B747 and minimum: 35 minutes for A320). What�s more, as
arrival time tends to be delayed in the actual operations, this airport
management division requires making efforts to shorten the work time by even
just one minute and realize the arrival and departure exactly based on the
schedule. </p>
<p>They must perform extremely diversified and complicated operations in a short
time, and therefore, although systematization and automation have been
progressing, human errors are not irrelevant. Especially, decisions are made
mainly based on the information obtained via radio, and a possibility of
occurring perception/recognition errors and judgment/decision errors always
exists. Thus, for the past few years, the division has made efforts to prevent
human errors through participation in training for pilots and dispatchers. </p>
<p>However, as human errors by the airport management operations have less
severe impact on direct safety compared with those by pilots and dispatchers,
the tendency of recurrence of same errors is high and especially a necessity of
perspective of recurrence prevention was perceived. The operations of this
division have a characteristic that most of their operations directly reflect on
customer satisfaction such as punctuality, efficiency and comfort. Thus it was
recognized that the training program suitable for the operational
characteristics of the airport management division is necessary. </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <font FACE="Arial"><b>
    <p>2.2. Motive for TRIZ Application</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</b></font>
<p>For the airline operations, not only safety but also punctuality, if customer
service is considered, are required. But the operational level has a strong
belief that realization of safety and that of punctuality are opposing. Actually
under the time-pressing condition, humans tend to make mistakes in
decision-making. From this kind of experience, the people of this division have
the psychological inertia -- safety and punctuality are confronting parameters,
so we do not spare any efforts, but ideal solution for realizing both never
exist.</p>
<p>Thus, we made the people related to this division understand that, if the
past specific operational improvements are analyzed with the TRIZ concepts, many
operational improvements can be explained using TRIZ inventive principles and
the problem of safety and the other contradicting parameters can also be solved
idealistically in the future. In this way, release from the conventional
psychological inertia was promoted. </p>
<p>Some criticize that these 40 Inventive Principles and Separation Principles
are difficult to apply to non-technical fields. But as they can eliminate a
psychological inertia, which disturbs pursuing ideality, if an expert who can
adequately convert the cases uses them, they can work as an effective tool. </p>
<p>For example, if the problem is viewed in the opposing relationship of
[Accuracy - Time], four perspectives of thinking can be obtained. The highest
priority principle, [24. Mediator], has the sub-principle of [a. Use an
intermediary object to transfer or carry out an action]. The improvement of the
ground handling method currently undertaken by Company A is an attempt to
improve work accuracy and time accuracy by appointing a manager between the
station control division and the work related to aircraft. This can be explained
using the 40 Inventive Principles. </p>

</font>
<p>Application of TRIZ to several cases, which relieved psychological inertia
from the project members for developing the training program, as a result,
proved the improvement of reliability of TRIZ as a problem solving tool and
effectiveness as a tool for eliminating psychological inertia of participants of
the training program seminar. Then it was decided to use TRIZ as a basic tool
for problem solving in the program.</p>

  <dir>
    <font FACE="Arial"><b>
    <p>2.3. Motive for AFD Application</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</b></font>
<p>In order to prevent recurrence of human errors of pilots, the safety
reporting system has been established in the advanced aviation countries. This
is a system to accumulate human errors that actually occurred and make use of
them for prevention in the future.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, errors occurring in the airport management division have
less serious direct effect on safety, so the same errors were repeated, and thus
it was recognized that the perspective not to repeat the same error is further
important. What�s more as the airport management operations have many related
divisions and the quality of errors is different from the navigation operations.
Therefore, it was determined that for recurrence prevention, more accurate
analysis and development of solutions are required. Thus, it was reviewed as to
whether the AFD (Anticipatory Failure Determination) developed by Boris Zlotin
et al. can be used as a tool.</p>
<p>In the process of this program development, the operational functions of the
airport development division were defined. As a result of reviewing what kind of
method can be considered to deteriorate these functions, in most cases,
satisfactory results could be obtained, and it was decided to use AFD as a tool
for error analysis and recurrence prevention.</p>
<p>It was also concluded that as an analysis using AFD handles all the elements
(both useful and harmful elements) drawn in the Problem Formulator equally
without any prejudice, analysis while maintaining the entirety of the system was
possible.</p>

    <p>2.4. Problem when Introducing TRIZ</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</b></font>
<p>It is well known that TRIZ is effective for suggesting viewpoints of grasping
a problem and a direction for solution not only in the technical field but also
non-technical field. However, in order to provide it as a tool in the airport
management operations (non-technical field), the same way as when providing it
to engineers is not sufficient. Thus, in this program, within the range where
the TRIZ essential excellence is not impaired, modification where the
non-engineers can accept it without any confusion was required.</p>
<p>The essential excellence of TRIZ is, as a matter of fact, the �Ideality�
concept, and making people understand how the problem should be viewed and
providing what kind of perspective of thinking can be used to generate ideas for
solutions, including effective use of resources. </p>

  <dir>
    </font><font FACE="Arial">
    <p>3.1. Overview of Modification</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</font></b>
<p>Introduction of the Classical TRIZ techniques was difficult because the case
is non-technical, had a time limitation together with its volume. Thus the
limited techniques from below (1) to (4) were selected and introduced after
modifying them to make them suitable for the actual operational characteristics.
Modification here means mainly expressing the Inventive Principles in an easy to
understand way for non-engineers as well as limiting the techniques to use.</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>As a technique to understand basic concepts of TRIZ, Contradiction was
    selected. </li>
  <li>Along with the operational characteristics in reality -- information
    oriented -- the method to analyze the problem situation using the Problem
    Formulator advocated by Boris Zlotin et al. with addition of Function
    Information Analysis proposed by Prof. Moritani, the author�s colleague at
    SANNO, was used.</li>
  <li>For providing perspectives of thinking to solve problems, Contradictions
    consisting of 40 Inventive Principles and Separation Principles, and small
    number of limited numbers of Operators provided by Boris Zlotin et al.,
    which can be used manually, were selected.</li>
  <li>As the method of recurrence prevention, the basic concept of AFD was
    used.</li>
</ol>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <font FACE="Arial"><b>
    <p>3.2. Way of Providing Contradiction</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</b></font>
<p>In TRIZ understanding of Contradictions is important in learning basic
perspective of problem analysis. But it is also a fact that even if 39
Engineering Parameters and 40 Inventive Principles, which construct the
Contradiction Matrix, and Separation Principles are explained as they are, they
are too confused to use for non-engineers. Thus, although addition of
non-technical explanation is required, for application of the Contradiction
Matrix in a non-technical field, as 39 Engineering Parameters are not necessary,
but just a small number of them is good enough. So the descriptions of 19
Parameters were created for non-engineers. 19 Parameters are Speed, Stability of
object, Strength, Power, Loss of information, Waste of time, Reliability,
Accuracy of measurement, Accuracy of manufacturing, Harmful factors acting on
object, Harmful side effects, Manufacturability, Convenience of use,
Repairability, Adaptability, Complexity of device, Complexity of control, Level
of automation and Productivity.</p>
<p>For the 40 Inventive Principles, the defect that the sentences are slightly
longer was ignored, and describing on the level of sub-principles was used. This
makes it easier for non-engineers to understand these principles well, then
descriptions were modified. As a result, easiness for using the principles in
non-technical field was improved substantially. </p>
<p>Physical Contradictions can be applied to non-technical field more easily
than Technical Contradictions. The Separation Principles have a quite high
abstraction, thus applying to non-technical field is easy. </p>

    <p>3.3. Problem Formulator to Accurately Grasp the Problem</p>

</dir>
</b></font>
<p>The method to draw a complicated problem actually occurred in Problem
Formulator by adding the drawing method of Function Information Analysis while
maintaining the entirety of the problem was developed and introduced into the
program.</p>
<p>The Function Information Analysis is a technique to analyze operations by
clearly dividing functions, information and files. The objective of introducing
this method is to grasp the problem situation definitely while maintaining the
entirety. Once the problem situation is defined, the perspective for solution
can be obtained through application of Operators.</p>

    <font FACE="Arial"><b>
    <p>3.3.1. How to Draw a Function Information Analysis Type Problem
    Formulator</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</b></font>
<p>The basic rule is to draw one by using two types of elements related to the
problem -- functions and information -- after dividing them into useful or
harmful. Then, the mutual relationship between the functions are linked using
the four types of arrows. </p>
<p>As a result of a review actually using this technique, focusing on things,
which seem to be the causes of the problem, could be performed more clearly than
the analysis using other techniques. For example, [Information was not
delivered] became a more appropriate analysis result [Information was not
delivered in a timely manner]. Then for the idea of preventing recurrence, the
direction of eliminating [Something disturbing the timely manner] could be
obtained. </p>

<p>In the course of the program development, attempt was made to solve several
problems using this Operator. As a result, for example, in the problem structure
of Figure 9, the solution that information will be provided in a proper timing
by obtaining information currently delivered by the function Z from other
operational process could be obtained.</p>

    <p>3.5. Basic Concept of AFD as a Technique for Recurrence Prevention</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</b></font>
<p>The basic concept of AFD consists of the technique for approaching what kind
of method is there if the problem will be generated intentionally and the idea
that the resources, which can be the cause of the problem, definitely exist near
there. Boris Zlotin et al. explained this using the theory that if there are
three elements -- oxygen, fuel and temperature --, fire can be caused.</p>
<p>Accordingly, arranging resources to realize the phenomenon, rather than
searching the cause of the problem randomly, makes cause analysis easier. This
can be applied disregarding the problem is in the technical or non-technical
field. As the characteristic of the airport management division, frequency of
appearing of human factors as resources just increases.</p>
<p>Effectiveness of AFD is to improve easiness of thinking as well as expand the
thinking range by converting the negative thinking process of searching the
cause to the positive thinking process of establishing the mechanism and
discovering the resources. </p>
<p>The characteristic of this thinking development is to make it possible to
easily list elements, which hinder operational functions. If such elements can
be identified, it is possible to establish the situation where stable
functioning can be realized by eliminating or separating any resource, which
causes the element, from the operational process. </p>
<p>For example, a delay of aircraft can easily be caused by [Delay of delivery
of number of passengers to be on board]. In other words, in order to realize the
delay of aircraft, the method to realize this [Delay of delivery of number of
passengers to be on board] without fail should be considered. This method has
several resources (not the idea of main cause and second cause, but the
countermeasure for the entire system can be considered by reviewing the all the
resources). Then the most effective method is [Cause a trouble in the timing of
communication]. As the method to eliminate this, [Communication staff will be
changed from the current gate operator to the lamp manager] can be determined.</p>
<p>Then, by considering the human errors against this event, [Cause a trouble in
the timing of communication], human errors generated here can be identified.</p>

    <p>3.6. Whole Picture of the Training Program</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</b></font>
<p>The human error prevention training of the airport management division in
Company A was designed as the one consisting of two phases.</p>
<p>The first phase is the learning phase of basic thinking (solution thinking of
pursuing Ideality based on the TRIZ concept) for errors and problem solving
mainly human factors.</p>
<p>The second phase is to learn the details of analysis and solution thinking to
prevent recurrence of errors generated.</p>
<p>Figure 10 shows the element structure. In the drawing, TRIZ was applied at
elements (3), (4), (5) and (6).</p>

  <p>4. summary</p>
</dir>
</b></font>
<p>In the course of developing this training program, by adding TRIZ to
recurrence prevention of human errors, it was confirmed that the human error
factors could be positioned in the entire system and it was effective for
prevention of recurrence as system. However, there is an aspect that in
modification of Inventive Principles of TRIZ, complete objectivity could not be
maintained. This point should be continuously improved through the actual
implementation of training and verification of the results.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if TRIZ was applied, analysis of human errors was still
ambiguous. This point also should be further improved through accumulation of
analysis.</p>
