</font></b>
<p>The author was involved in the development of the next-generation portable
toilet -- a hot product in an industry related to the elderly -- at Company S, a
Japanese leading chemical manufacturer, as a consultant of the Sanno Institute
of Management. This paper introduces the case of skillfully utilizing technology
management techniques, including TRIZ, with emphasis on its unique development
process.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of this development process is that, although TRIZ was at the
center, a trinity development approach was realized while organically
integrating other technology management techniques: VE (Value Engineering),
which is characterized by its functional approach, and the marketing technique,
which is essential for new product business strategy.</p>
<p>This development process consists of three phases mainly using the following
techniques: Phase 1: Developing a New Product Proposal -- DE (Directed
Evolution) of I-TRIZ + VE + Marketing; Phase 2: Generating a New Product Design
Proposal -- VE + IPS (Inventive Problem Solving) of I-TRIZ; and Phase 3:
Developing of a New Product Business Plan -- mainly Marketing.</p>
<p>Company S originally had developed engineers (in the position as an internal
consultant) with profound knowledge of technology management techniques
(especially, VE and IE) in the head office organization. Therefore, the support
system for new product development and technical problem solution at individual
divisions could have been established mainly with these engineers who received
the TRIZ training (primarily Classical TRIZ) beforehand. This is a significant
factor leading to this project’s success. Thus the actual project promotion
system for the techniques such as TRIZ at Company S will be briefly explained at
the end of this paper.</p>

<p>The overall flow of the new product development process, which was proposed
and designed by the author and actually used in the development of the
new-generation portable toilet, is shown in Illustration 1.</p>
<p>During the actual activities, Phase 2 (Phase for development design proposal)
was further divided into Concept Design Phase and Basic Design Phase (a more
detailed design review level), and DR (Design Review) was conducted four times
in total along with this division (see Illustration 1).</p>

<p>&#12288;</font>As clearly shown in the illustration, in Phase 1 the first half is
based on DE and the second half corresponds to planning phase VE (including
marketing technique). Phase 2 utilizes IPS (I-TRIZ) for conceptualizing ideas
and compensating defects of ideas, while using development / design VE
characterized by its functional approach as a base, and corresponds to the
process to effectively implement the valuable design proposal. Then final Phase
3 is allocated to the activities for developing a market development plan in
order to introduce the product design proposal, which is output of Phase 2, into
the market (product launch). Thus this paper especially focuses on Phases 1 and
2, where the use of TRIZ (primarily I-TRIZ) was emphasized, and introduces its
distinctive practical process based on the actual case study more in detail.</p>

<p>These are the first half of Phase 1 and correspond to the activities until
preparing a future prediction scenario of a product (portable toilet), which can
expect a future improvement in value through DE (one of the techniques of I-TRIZ).
These implementation steps of DE (see Illustration 4) can be sorted out in
accordance with the basic steps of DE (based on the broader interpretations of
DE as a decision making process in a series of corporate activities) as
indicated in Illustration 5.</p>
<p>As Illustration 5 clearly shows, the latter half of the DE basic steps (Steps
4 and 5) correspond to all from the second half of Phase 1 to Phase 4 of the
implementation process of the new product development activities (see
Illustration 4). This means that if DE is defined broadly, DE activities cover
the whole new product development activities. This paper, however, limits its
focus to Steps 1 to 6 based on the narrow definition of the DE activities.</p>

  <p>We structurally sorted out the changes from the past (assuming 1970s and
  1980s) to the present (assuming 1990s) for the target system (portable
  toilet), its subsystem (components of the toilet) and its supersystem (space
  in which the portable toilet is used and more widely social environment). The
  history of technology evolution from the past to the present was sorted out
  utilizing the matrix for system evolution (see Illustration 7). Specifically,
  we sorted out the technological system, its subsystem and supersystem, which
  seemed to be applicable to each cell of the matrix, with reference to the
  answers of the questionnaire in Step 1.</p>

  </b>
  <p>We also structurally sorted out the future with reference to the analysis
  result of the changes from the past to the present of the matrix prepared in
  Step 2. Specifically, the same as in Step 2, the history of technology
  evolution from the present to the future was sorted out utilizing the matrix
  for system evolution. </p>
  <p>Then, we created the target system for the near future (assuming 10 years
  from now, in this case) looking back at the history from the past to the
  present for the target system, its subsystem and its supersystem. At the same
  time, we created the subsystem and supersystem in the same way. When assuming
  the near future in this step, we tried to create the system in the form of
  idea widely, not limited to the answers described in the questionnaire.</p>

  <p>We applied the contents of the matrix for the system evolution prepared in
  the previous step to Patterns of Evolution and map them. In this case we did
  not stick to one Pattern of Evolution, but if several Patterns were
  applicable, we also tried to cover all of them. The actual mapping (including
  products of competitors) was very extensive, but the results are related to
  the expertise of Company S, thus the direct introduction is refrained.
  Instead, the photos of representative portable toilets of Company S will be
  introduced in a time series (see Illustration 8). Just seeing these photos is
  good enough to read out several Patterns of Evolution. (The author does not
  make any explanation here, but leaves it to the imagination of the readers.)</p>

  </b>
  <p>With reference to the Patterns of Evolution mapping charts prepared in the
  previous step, we made several scenarios for the target system. In this
  project, each member individually developed one or two scenarios. There are
  various specific approaches to write a scenario, but basically while reviewing
  combination patterns of future events positioned in the mapping charts, a
  scenario is prepared for each combination group. But the details of the
  scenario greatly depend on a writer’s own creativity. When writing the
  scenario, the writer should note that the future events to be used will be
  described in details from the environment where the developed product will be
  used to the required functions of the target system (portable toilet)
  utilizing three levels (subsystem, system, supersystem) in a well-balanced
  way.</p>

        <p>Step 6: Evaluate each concept (scenario) for the target system.</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
  </dir>
  </b>
  <p>We reviewed the individual scenarios prepared by each member and attempted
  to refine them into an optimal scenario after some of them were integrated, if
  they could do so.</p>
  <p>In actual work, there were originally 13 scenarios; we integrated and
  evaluated, and compiled them into five scenarios; then finally one of them was
  adopted as a commercialization scenario (so-called the base for
  commercialization concept) of this project. </p>
  <p>When integrating and evaluating the scenarios, it is necessary to consider
  their feasibility. Therefore, the scenarios should be evaluated from the
  criteria such as technical limitation, economical investment scale, and legal
  regulations, and that scenario, which can be expected to have the highest
  feasibility as a result, should be selected. The commercialization scenario of
  this project was incorporated into a product proposal to be prepared as an
  output during the second half of Phase 1 (Steps 7 to 13).</p>
  <b>
  <p>2) Planning phase VE (0 look VE) activities: Steps 7 to 13</p>
</dir>
</b>
<p>The second half of Phase 1 corresponds to the planning phase VE (0 Look VE)
activities, and is the level to elaborate the scenario to comply with a product
proposal level aiming at implementation of the scenario adopted at the first
half of Phase 1.</p>
<p>More specifically, the functions required in planning to be equipped in a
developing product should be defined using the commercialization scenario and
the market (customer) information added from the marketing perspective. Then the
basic specification (e.g., performance) of the product as corresponding to the
functions should be established and incorporated into the proposal. The cost to
be allocated to achieve these functions (so-called cost planning activities)
should be determined.</p>
<p>A series of these activities are essentially the same as preparing a quality
chart in Quality Function Deployment (QFD), but the point aiming at value
improvement from the viewpoints of required functions and costs is a
characteristic of the planning phase VE. As VE is a function-oriented approach,
there is no sketch imagining the product (not to be bound by a fixed concept as
object oriented), but only a product scenario in the product proposal of this
project. This point is also unique from the conventional product proposals which
contain product images (see Illustration 9).</p>

<p>In this Phase we practiced Development Design VE (corresponding to Steps 14
to 29, but IPS was used from Steps 17 to 28 when conceptualizing ideas) aiming
at implementation of the product proposal (actually approved by DR-1) shown in
Illustration 10. In this paper due to limitation of the space, the details are
not included, but the essence of each step is summarized in Illustration 11.</p>

      <p>Phase 3: Business Planning Phase to Marketing Activities</p>

</b>
<p>The objective of this Phase is to strategically develop a sales plan in the
market of the product realized in the previous Phase (in reality, the review was
started before the design drawings were completed). This Phase is not the main
theme of this paper, thus no detail explanation will be provided, but the line
map, which shows the positioning of the product developed this time
(next-generation portable toilet: actually high-grade type with grain pattern)
in relation to the competitors as well as the own existing products, is as below
(see Illustration 12).</p>

<p>For the products realized through this development process, two prototypes
were exhibited at the International Care and Welfare Equipment Exhibition (in
Japan) from October 24 to 26, 2001 and stirred the great sensation. </p>
<p>The prototypes are as shown below:</p>

<p>As a great factor that could lead this project success, the author is
confident in the point that he could facilitate the project team as much as
possible as a consultant greatly contributed, but as the same level or even
more, support from internal consultants of Company S should not be forgotten.
</p>
<p>This is because, as mentioned at the beginning of this paper, these internal
consultants have affluent knowledge not only in engineering technology but also
technology management techniques (e.g., VE, IE, QC) as well as instruction
experiences (as an internal instructor). Even if there was no external
consultant (the author), there was sufficient support function to the project
members. What’s more, it is worth mentioning here that Company S formed the
actual project team after these consultants received the training (provided by
the author), which combined the development VE and TRIZ fundamentals prepared by
SANNO.</p>
<p>Utilizing this experience, the author will continue to support practical TRIZ
introduction into the Japanese corporations.</p>
