<i><b>
<p>Creativity in Product Innovation </b></i>by Jacob Goldenberg and David
Mazursky, 2002, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 224 pages. US $80.00
hardback, US $28.00 paperback (recently $23.20 at Barnes &amp; Noble on-line) , ISBN
0-521-00249-4.</p>
<i><b>
<p>Creativity in Product Innovation </b></i>is loosely related to TRIZ, through
the use of �templates� for innovation, that show how the knowledge of the
history of the functions of a product (or service, or system) can be predictors
of the next generation of the system. </p>
<p>People who are familiar with TRIZ will find many of the ideas related to
those that they use in TRIZ. People who are not familiar with TRIZ will not
learn much about TRIZ (there is one small reference to Altshuller, which was
picked up in the Wall Street Journal publicity that this book received) but they
will see how the general idea of patterns of evolution can be turned into an
idea-generating system.</p>
<p>The authors are a senior lecturer and a professor at the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem, School of Business Studies. Since this credential is prominently
advertised, it is astonishing how weak their attention is to normal academic
protocol, such as independent research, and credit to the originators of ideas.</p>
<p>The book purports to be a review of creativity and innovation, especially in
the field of marketing new products. Although there are studies reporting great
success for the �Creativity Template� approach that they are advocating, the
fact that these studies have been carried out by themselves would make them
subject to question, and the suggestion that they may have been able to bias the
results is not unreasonable. If a pharmaceutical company had carried out such
research they would be open to criticism and separate studies would have to be
conducted!</p>
<p>Their review of the approaches used by other people in this field are
strongly biased, basically dismissed with a few lines and reports of studies,
mainly conducted by themselves. Some statements are glaringly over the top:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li><i>Regarding Mind Mapping and Random Stimulation they say: �There are no
  reports of tests conducted to estimate the efficiency of this method�.</i>
  This is blatantly not true.</li>
  <li><i>Market trends can be predicted by examining only the product itself,
  without studying the customer.</i> The success of the combination of quality
  function deployment (which gathers and quantifies the �voice of the customer�)
  with TRIZ, both as tool sets and within the Design for Six Sigma process,
  counters this argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certainly the words used in the book to describe their Templates approach are
somewhat new, and on the whole the book is easy to read and understand. But the
method is not new and is in fact a reduction of the tools and processes
available to any TRIZ follower.</p>
<p>The main section of the book describes and demonstrates 4 Templates, with a
Forecasting Matrix added to assist use of one of the Templates. If one decodes
these Templates, one finds that they are simple Su-field action/function
statements.</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>The <u>Attribute Dependency Template</u> is a suggestion to use a
  Component (In TRIZ terms a resource) of the system to perform a new function,
  or a new variation of that function.</li>
  <li>The <u>Replacement Template</u> suggests you use a Component to replace
  the function of another component and thus remove that component (the TRIZ
  trimming technique or the utilization of resources method.)</li>
  <li>The <u>Displacement Template</u> suggests removing a component and all its
  functions, which is standard TRIZ where the functions are no longer required,
  but we do like their additional suggestion that you then find a market for
  this new product, which lacks these functions, and they give good examples.</li>
  <li>The <u>Component Control Template</u> suggests using a component to reduce
  a harmful effect from an outside component. (Principle 9 of the TRIZ 40
  Principles, or Standard 1.2.1 of the 76 Standard Solutions.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Our concern is that this simple analysis misses the wider power of TRIZ for
idea generation and for idea evaluation. Someone using their Templates might
miss more complex interactions where a combination of components may be used
interactively to deliver results, and may miss the benefits of system (and
super- and sub-system analysis) producing results at some other level than the
one being attacked.</p>
<p>In a later section of the book there is another set of Templates for use in
Advertising. The explanations are clear, and the uses obvious once the
explanations and examples have been analyzed. The creativity templates and
explanations of creative advertising help the reader to guide product marketing
in an effective way. The names suggest the content as follows: </p>
<dl>
  <dd>The Pictorial Analogy Template </dd>
  <dd>The Extreme Situation Template</dd>
  <dd>The Consequences Template</dd>
  <dd>The Competition Template </dd>
  <dd>The Interactive Experiment Template</dd>
  <dd>The Dimensionality Alteration Template</dd>
</dl>
<p>These are tools that most creativity and innovation consultants and
facilitators have played with, and the labels make the ideas quite clear (except
perhaps Interactive Experiment, which is about getting the viewer to engage with
the activity on the screen, real or in imagination), but having put them into
the package like this is neat and definitely in the spirit of TRIZ; that is,
doing the research and then coming up with a general package of solutions that
can be applied in a variety of circumstances.</p>
<p>Overall, the book is easy to read, will help some people get oriented to
basic TRIZ concepts. The lack of credit to the originators of many of the
concepts is a very disturbing aspect of this book-some of the examples come
directly from Roni Horowitz�s ASIT training program, for example, and the
researchers who developed Synectics, TRIZ, Mind-mapping and Lateral Thinking are
similarly ignored, although their concepts are absorbed into the templates. </p>
<p>The global publicity that Dr. Goldenberg has received (�one of the 14 minds
that will change our time� May 13,2002, Wall Street Journal) almost make it
necessary for TRIZ practitioners to read this book, so that they can explain to
others which of the concepts are derived from TRIZ and which are different. If
<i><b>Creativity in Product Innovation </b></i>serves to introduce the general
idea of system evolution and patterns to a wider audience it will have done a
considerable service. It would be regrettable if readers stop with the limited
ideas in this book, without exploring the much richer fields of TRIZ.</p>
