<p>This paper presents a system of the laws of technical system evolution. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. INTRODUCTION</p>
</b><font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A research on developing the laws of technical evolution has
been conducted by the author since 1973. Principal theoretical statements were
formulated in 1984. As a foundation for the research, the laws of technical
system evolution were selected which were originally developed by Genrich
Altshuller, the creator of the Theory of Inventve Problem Solving. (1), (2).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to Altshuller, the following researchers
contributed to study and developments the laws of technical system evolution: B.
Goldowsky; B. Zlotin and A. Zusmann; Yu. Salamatov and I. Kondrakov; S. Litvin
and V. Guerassimov; I. Vertkin; G. Ivanov; V. Petrov and E. Zlotin; M. Rubin; V.
Fey; A. Pinyaev; I. Zakharov; V. Dubrov; G. Frenklakh; G. Ezersky; A. Bystritsky
</font>(5-40).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Form our point of view, until now, no unified vision of the
laws of technical system evolution was available. All the above-mentioned
authors presented generic and specific aspects of the laws. There are several
systems available which describe the laws of technical system evolution. In our
opinion, most successful are the systems developed by G. Altshuller; B. Zlotin
and A. Zusmann; and Yu. Salamatov.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This paper presents a system of laws, which, in the opinion
of the author, makes it possible to perform forecasts of technology evolution
more thoroughly and easier. </p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. SYSTEM OF LAWS</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1. General information </p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Evolution of all objects of the material world including
technological objects are governed by certain laws. Among the most general laws
are the <b>laws of dialectics</b> (the law of the unity (interpenetration) of
opposites; the law of transformation of quantity into quality; and the law of
the negation of the negation). </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A system of the laws of technical system evolution must have
three levels: <b>demands, functions and systems.</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A hierarchy of the system of laws developed by the authors is
presented in Figure 1.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 1.</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The laws of system evolution can be divided to two groups:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Laws of system organization</b> (those
      which define <b>viability of a system</b>) and</p>
      </li>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Laws of system evolution</b> (those which
      define how <b>technical systems evolve</b>).</p>
      </li>
</ul>
      <b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.2. Laws of dialectics in technology evolution. </p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most general laws of the laws of dialectics are:</p>
        <b>
        </p><ul>
          <li>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Law of the Unity (Interpenetration) of Opposites;
        </p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Law of Transformation of Quantity into Quality;
        </p>
          </li>
          <li>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Law of the Negation of the Negation</p>
          </li>
</ul>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <b>Law of the Unity (Interpenetration) of Opposites</b>
serves as a source for creation of all objects including material objects, where
technical systems belong. The law defines one of the key TRIZ concepts:
contradiction.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <b>Law of Transformation of Quantity into Quality</b>
defines a general mechanism of evolution. Quantitative changes in a system take
place continuously accordingly the S-curve of evolution. When a certain limit of
quantitative evolution is reached, a system experiences qualitative changes.
Further evolution of the system starts according to a new S-curve. During this
process, quantitative changes take place continuously whereas qualitative
changes take place in discrete steps.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To imagine a full diagram of evolution of technical systems,
it is necessary to take into account a so-called “line of life of a technical
system”, a regularity defined by Genrich Altshuller (1, pp. 113-119).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An essence of the <b>Law of the Negation of the Negation</b>
is that a process of progressive evolution consists of a series of relative
repetitions, as if going through the same phases again and again. However, each
repetition takes place at a higher level of evolution by using new elements,
materials, and technologies. We can say, that in this case we have a
spiral-shaped evolution. For example, fashion design is the most obvious example
of spiral-shaped evolution.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.3. Regularities of demand evolution </p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Knowing regularities of DEMAND evolution makes it possible to
predict future demands. This, in turn, allows us to define what functions and
systems will be needed to meet these new demands. This knowledge also makes it
possible to discover radically new directions of technical system evolution
(pioneering solutions).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regularities of demand evolution are governed by <b>the
law of demand growth</b>. A general trend of demand evolution states that
meeting of demands evolves from meeting <b>primitive demands</b> to meeting <b>
intelligent and creative demands</b>.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regularities of demand evolution separate along the two
directions: appearance of new demands and evolution of existing demands.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The demands can be met by available and new functions.
Changing of these functions, in turn, is governed by certain regularities as
well.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Known functions</b> can be delivered by the <b>available
systems</b> or by creation of <b>new systems</b>.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New functions</b> can be delivered by <b>using the existing
systems in a new context</b> or by <b>creating qualitatively new systems</b>.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among <b>the laws of demand evolution</b> are: <b>
idealization of demands</b>, <b>growths of dynamics of demands</b>, <b>
coordination of demands</b>, <b>merging or specialization of demands</b>.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Development of new demands is conducted in accord with a
technique proposed by the author (5).</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.4. Regularities of function evolution</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us study some regularities of FUNCTION evolution, for
instance, <b>poly-functionality</b> and <b>mono-functionality</b>. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the beginning of evolution, systems are created as <b>
poly-functional</b>, or <b>universal</b>. At the final stage of evolution
systems <b>become more specific</b>, and further evolve by separation of
evolution of specific functions. As a result, the systems become <b>
mono-functional</b>. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regularities of <b>poly-</b> and <b>mono-functionality</b>
are based on the mechanisms of <b>expansion</b> and <b>convolution</b> <b>of
functions</b>.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The laws of function evolution</b> are similar to the laws of
demand evolution, however they should be regarded with respect to functionality:
<b>making functions more ideal (idealization of functions); growth of the degree
of function dynamics; coordination of functions; transition to mono or
poly-functionality</b>.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Idealization of functions </b>is achieved by<b> increasing
the degree of function dynamics, then by transition to mono- or
poly-functionality </b>and by further<b> coordination of functions.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regularities of expansion and convolution of functions </b>
are presented by the author in (11,12).</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. THE LAWS OF SYSTEM ORGANIZATION</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This group of laws governs a newly created system. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The laws of system organization define criteria of <b>
vitality</b> for newly created technical systems</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the main laws of the laws of system organization are:
<b>systemity</b>; <b>completeness of system parts; abundance of system parts;
existence of links between system parts as well as between the system and its
supersystem; minimal coordination of parts and parameters of a system</b>.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A structure of the main laws of system organization is
presented in Figure 2.</p>

</font>
<b>
<p align="left">Figure 2</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.1. The law of systemity </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Systemity </b>is a coordinated interaction between all
objects, including environment where the objects are located. This interaction
must be fully balanced.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">System requirements:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A system must be designated to meet a certain <i><b>
    purpose</b></i>.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A system must possess a certain <b>structure</b>,
    which provides the achievement of the purpose.</p>
    </li>
    <b>
    <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Relationships and interactions</b> within the system
    and with its supersystem must provide a full balance, which means that there
    must be no negative effects caused by the relationships or the interactions.</p>
    </li>
    <b>
    <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regularities of evolution</b> of a given system as
    well as environment must be taken into account.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A system meets its <i><b>purpose</b></i> if the system
achieves a <b>general</b> <b>goal</b> and delivers all required <b>principal</b>
and <b>auxiliary</b> functions.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A system structure </b>consists of<b> the system itself, </b>
its<b> subsystems, supersystem </b>and<b> environment.</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A systemity is taken into account by using the following
laws:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Completeness and abundance of a system.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minimal coordination (ensuring desired
      relationships and interferences).</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.2. The law of system completeness </p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The system completeness can be <b>functional</b> and <b>
structural</b>.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Functional completeness</b> must ensure delivery of a <b>
general goal</b> of the system and correspond to the functional purpose of the
system, and in the first place, to the <b>main function</b> of the system. This
means that all <b>principal</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> functions must be fulfilled
as well. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Structural completeness of the system must provide presence
of all required <b>elements</b> and <b>links</b> in the system.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A <b>main function</b> of the system is provided by a <b>main
working unit</b> of the system. Energy supply and control are the principal
functions of the system. These functions are provided by an energy source and a
system comprising a control unit. Most important among auxiliary functions are
<b>conversion </b>and <b>transport</b> of energy and information.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a conclusion, <b>the law of system completeness</b>
describes the least but necessary set of system parts that provide minimal
working behavior of the system. In general, the following parts are necessary:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Working unit</b>.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Energy source</b> and <b>converter</b>.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>A system of control</b> (control unit).</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Energy transformation</b> can be provided, for instance, by
an <b>engine</b> whereas <b>energy and information transport</b> can be provided
by <b>transmission</b> (links).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, a general case requires the following system parts: the
<b>working unit</b>; <b>energy</b> to provide the working tool; and <b>a system
for control</b> over the working unit.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.3. The law of abundance </p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ABUNDANCE </i></b><i>is a regularity which indicates that
about <b>80% of work</b> is delivered by approximately <b>20% of functions,
elements and links </b>in a system. When developing a system it is necessary to
take into account, that in order to deliver the required work <b>approximately
80% of auxiliary elements</b> <b>and links</b> will be needed in addition to
those main elements and links that are supposed to deliver a main function.
These auxiliary elements and links will provide <b>20% of the work only</b>.
This results in the necessity to consider some <b>extra consumption of material,
energy and information</b> when designing a new system (approximately 20% to
deliver main function and 80% to deliver auxiliary functions). </p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same ratio is valid for execution of any type of work. A
major volume of work (80-90% of readiness) is fulfilled during 20% of time; and
remaining 80% of time is required to finish the work completely. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Due to this, often the work is not fully completed.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Abundance can be <b>functional</b> and <b>structural</b>.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.4. The law of existence of links.</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This law was first formulated by G. Altshuller in the
beginning of the 70’s as <b>the law of energy conductivity in a system</b> (1).<b>
</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law of Altshuller is a particular case of the law of
links, which was formulated by the author in the end of the 70’s.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without considering all possible links and influences a
system can not be well-behaved. Moreover, the system can create ecological and
other problems, negatively changing the environment, supersystem, human health,
neighboring systems and so on.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Links (interrelations) and influences (interferences) can be
of the following types:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Efficiency of a working unit can be increased by the use of a

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dynamics of evolution of the working unit indicates that in

</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the next phase of evolution, another field is added to
the existing one. As a result, we observe a transition from MONO-field to
Bi-field. Combination of the fields of the same physical type or of different
types is possible. The fields of the same type can be identical (<b>F1</b> + <b>
F1</b>) or have dissimilar characteristics (<b>F1</b> + <b>F1</b>’).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly to combining systems, further evolution is featured
by the coordination of the fields used in a system. For instance, (<b>F1</b> +
<b>F1~</b>) is a coordination of permanent field <b>F1</b> with a variable Field
<b>F1</b>~. Later, the fields can be replaced with a single field (MONO-field,
<b>F0</b>). This is process is known as <b>convolution</b>.</p>

single law, but takes place in a combined form. Apart from that, evolution takes
place in space as well: <b>from a single dot to a line, from the line to a

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Transition from <b>the line to the plane</b> and <b>volume</b>
can be done by the use of curves in the plane and space (see Fig. 17a).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Transition from <b>the plane to the volume</b>: the use of a
backside of a plane. In particular, it can be achieved by using the Mobius tape
(see Fig. 17b).</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Internal areas</b> can be used in the <b>volume</b> (the <b>
“nested doll”</b> principle). In particular, this can be <b>Kisilyov tape</b>
(similarly to the Mobius tape, but in volume). This trend is shown in Fig. 17c.
Other geometric effects can be used as well.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, pseudo-volumes can be used. For instance,
stereoscopic images, holograms, and 3D imaging in computer systems.</p>
