another article in this issue of the TRIZ Journal entitled <i>Breakthrough
Thinking ,</i> which presents a sequencing of TRIZ tools in a linear solution
process. This material is available to individual readers for use in their own
TRIZ studies. Those who seek to use the material for class instruction or other
uses are requested to contact the author. While the author’s company has given

<p>Several levels of the class are preferred to match the students capabilities
and interests. The highest level of the solution process is presented here. </p>
<p>This work is the result of ten years of classes, personal instruction from
TRIZ experts, research, teaching and application and represents dozens of
rewritings. It centers around the concept of <i>functions</i>.</p>
</font><font size="2"><b>
<p>Sequencing of TRIZ Tools</b></font><font SIZE="2"> One of the purposes of
presenting this article is to introduce a train of study that may be productive
in moving TRIZ to a new level of science. The current TRIZ tool-sets grossly
overlap each other. This overlap makes it difficult to know which tool is the
most appropriate for a given application. When the tool steps are broken out and
regrouped into relevant groupings, patterns emerge that were not visible before.
This method of investigation can be illustrated by the number patterns in the
example below.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="01a.gif" width="606" height="74"></p>
<p>Each of the groupings represents a TRIZ tool such as S-field Analysis or 40
Principles. Note that there is over-lap between the groups where numbers are
repeated. Although each number group is placed in sequence from lowest to
highest, no patterns emerge. Without patterns to guide us, it is difficult the
see what is missing. Now extract the numbers from the groups and reassemble them
into groups of positive even numbers, positive odd numbers, negative even
numbers and negative odd numbers as shown below.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="01b.gif" width="587" height="32"></p>
<i>
<p>In the context of these groupings, </i>patterns emerge. For instance, we note
that -4 is missing from the negative even numbers, while +6 is missing from the
positive even numbers. </p>
<p>The material presented in <i>Breakthrough Thinking</i> is the result of
reassembling the standard tool-sets into the relevant steps of a solution
procedure. Care was taken to sequence the steps to ensure that in order to
perform a given step, previous steps <i>must</i> be performed, or their output
assumed. For example, in order to resolve a contradiction, certain key pieces of
information<i> must </i>be known. These pieces of information are either
developed in previous steps or they are unconsciously assumed. As a result, the
solution process follows natural decision points, which branch to multiple
solutions.</p>
<p>It is recognized that some well-known and useful tools have not yet been
included. The reader is invited to make suggestions for improvement. Requests
for the original PowerPoint</font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">Ò</font><font SIZE="2">

the steps in a more preferred sequence for personal use.</p>
</font><font size="2"><b>
<p>Goals of the Solution process</b></font><font SIZE="2"> The form of the
solution process has been guided by the following goals:</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <dir>
      </font><b><font size="2">
      <p>Adjustability</font><font SIZE="2"> </font></b><font SIZE="2">The
      solution process should be teachable at a variety of levels to suit the
      capability and interest of the student. The top six steps are always
      taught, but sub-steps are simplified or eliminated and then added as the
      student gains greater mastery. This method of teaching is widely used to
      teach many subjects from music to mathematics. The focus should be on
      gradually increasing the ability of students while allowing success during
      the learning process.</p>
      </font><font size="2"><b>
      <p>Focus on Functions </b></font><font SIZE="2">Functions are rapidly
      becoming the language of problem- solving in many disciplines. In this
      problem-solution process, virtually all steps revolve around the concept
      of functions.</p>
      </font><font size="2"><b>
      <p>Simple Nomenclature</b></font><font SIZE="2"> As with many disciplines,
      the nomenclature of TRIZ is often difficult to learn. One goal of the
      solution-process is to make the nomenclature fit ideas that the student is
      already familiar with. For instance, “Dynamism” is changed to “Make
      Adjustable,” and “Local Quality” is changed to “Make Non-uniform.” A
      certain amount of new nomenclature is unavoidable, and care should be
      taken to introduce it at higher levels of the class so as not to
      intimidate beginning students.</p>
      </font><font size="2"><b>
      <p>Smaller Steps </b></font><font SIZE="2">Most beginning students are
      baffled by the seemingly “obvious” target- solutions presented in TRIZ
      literature. Many of these solutions are only obvious after the fact and
      represent large jumps in intuition. Some teachers may feel that these
      large jumps are a testament to the power of TRIZ and will try to impress
      the student with them. Unfortunately, many students are discouraged that
      such solutions are not as obvious to them. One goal of this
      solution-process is to decrease the step size, so that solutions are the
      result of several smaller steps rather than a few major leaps.</p>
      </font><font size="2"><b>
      <p>Visualization</b></font><font SIZE="2"> Along with the concept of
      “smaller steps” is the idea that solutions need to be visualized in order
      to become reality. Each step should aid the practitioner in visualizing a
      final solution. Some may feel that elegance or compactness is sacrificed
      by expanding classical TRIZ steps, but the goal must always be to make the
      solution more easily visualized. </p>
      </font><font size="2"><b>
      <p>Completeness of Solution </b></font><font SIZE="2">The term “solution”
      means different things to different people. For the sake of this
      solution-process, a solution is a sketch that someone could work from to
      design hardware. No difficult contradictions or problems would remain to
      be solved. Simply pointing out a physical phenomenon that might be used to
      solve a problem would not, in this context, be considered a solution,
      since difficult challenges would inevitably be encountered before a
      practical solution was evident.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </dir>
  </dir>
</dir>
</font><font size="2"><b>
<p>Functional Nomenclature</b></font><font SIZE="2"> It is recognized that the
proliferation of TRIZ terms is objectionable and makes it difficult for the new
student to translate between different authors. Sometimes different terms are
used to mean the same thing. In order for the reader to “translate” while
reading <i>Breakthrough Thinking</i>, a consistent nomenclature will be
established. </p>
<p>A <b>System</b> is a collection of objects which provide a function.</p>
<p>In this text and in <i>Breakthrough Thinking</i>, the physical element which
is acted on will be referred to as the <b>Product. </b>In other texts, it may be
referred to as the object or artifact. The object which acts on the Product is
referred to as the <b>Tool</b>. </p>
<p>The action or change which the tool performs on the product will be referred
to as the <b>Modification</b>. In some texts, this is referred to as the action.
It is usually a verb. The use of the term “Modification” will be new to many
readers, however it is used to stress the requirement that the action verb must
describe a <i>change or maintenance</i>. This is sometimes difficult for new
students to grasp. Students of the author are encouraged, in the beginning, to
use a longhand form of the modification. The longhand form begins with “Change”
or “Maintain”. For example, we can describe the action that occurs between a
tool “liquid” and a product “thermometer” which is immersed in the liquid. The
short form of the modification is “ heats” or “cools.” The longhand form of the
modification would be “Changes the temperature.” </p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="01c.gif" width="423" height="159"></p>
<p>The use of the term “modification” helps the student to understand that the
tool and product must be physical elements. It also helps the student to
correctly describe “confusing functions,” such as how paint protects wood. New
students often say “ Paint-protects-wood”. While the word “Protects” is a verb,
it is not a modification as it does not describe a <i>change</i> to the wood.
Insistence on using the word “Protects” will hamper the problem solver in later
steps. The longhand form immediately encourages the student to correctly write
“Paint-maintains the location of ---moisture” and “wood-maintains the position
of ---paint.” The short version now becomes “ paint -- stops-- moisture” and
“wood-holds-paint”. Once the long-hand form is firmly entrenched, the student
can usually revert back to the short form of the modification for brevity. </p>
<p>The modification to the product is <i>delivered</i> by an <b>Effect</b>. The
term “Effect” is an artificial convention, introduced by TRIZ practitioners that
allows us to group physical phenomenon into recognizable groupings. An example
of an Effect would be “capillary action.” The Effect of capillary action
actually arises from complex physical interactions involving several different
fields at the atomic level. However, most people readily recall the phenomenon
of capillary action from demonstrations of liquids rising in tubes. TRIZ
literature contains tables of these Effects which are very useful.</p>
<p>A<b> Field</b>, as described in TRIZ literature, is another artificial
grouping convention which allows us to talk about different manifestations of <i>
fundamental fields</i> as recognizable groups such as vibration, electromagnetic
radiation, gravity, mechanical stress and pressure. Some of these “fields” such
as Odor &amp; Taste may seem a little off-beat. Effects, as described above, are
delivered by one or several objects and their associated fields. </p>
<p>In summary, the <b>Tool</b> delivers the <b>Effect</b>, which delivers the <b>
Modification</b> to the <b>Product</b>. </p>
</font><b><font SIZE="6">
<p>Solution-process Steps</font><font size="2"> </font></b><font SIZE="2">
Following are explanations of the solution-process steps as described in <i>
Breakthrough Thinking</i>.</p>
</font><i><b><font size="2">
<p>Set High Goals</font><font size="2"> </font></b></i><font SIZE="2">The
important outputs of this step are: a clarification of what the system is; what
we will and will not try to change within the super-system; the main
disadvantage that we want to overcome; what we want to happen to the system and
super-system as a result of the changes; and the maximum system penalties which
we will allow, such as cost. </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    </font><b>
    <p>Choose or Create the Subject System</b><font SIZE="2"> Identifying a
    system that needs improvement helps to focus the problem solver and to more
    clearly determine system disadvantages. If the subject system does not
    currently exist, it is acceptable to guess at or create a surrogate system.</p>
    </font><b>
    <p>Determine Customer Requirements and System Disadvantages</b><font SIZE="2">
    Identify customers and then work with them to determine system requirements
    and current disadvantages. </p>
    <p>It is important to <i>verify</i> that a disadvantage really exists. This
    is especially true in the area of reliability improvement. Shop data can be
    misleading. For instance, a repair shop sees a certain product failure over
    and over and concludes that the product is unreliable. What the repairman
    does not see is all of the units that operate successfully for long periods
    of time, making the overall reliability very high.</p>
    </font><b>
    <p>Model the Current Technical System or Process</b><font SIZE="2"> Use
    Function Analysis to model the system or process. Although modeling the
    current process will aid in the process of determining what is causing the
    disadvantages, this is not the main tool for cause-effect analysis. This
    step helps to determine what the system really is and what the penalties are
    for delivering the modification to the product. (Note that a function-like
    structure for disassociation and combination are introduced in the process
    diagrams. Classical function modeling is clumsy at describing these
    spontaneous chemical processes).</p>

</font>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <b>
    <p>Determine Element or Process Step Values</b><font SIZE="2"> Knowing the
    penalties for delivering the required function to the system product will
    influence our goals.</p>
    </font><b>
    <p>Set a High Bar</b><font SIZE="2"> It is extremely important to set high
    goals. A goal is only high when we sufficiently constrain the system
    penalties (such as cost--Anyone can make a system improvement that costs a
    lot and requires increasing complexity). Because TRIZ practitioners gain the
    confidence to tackle harder and harder problems, they are not hesitant to
    set high goals. High goals can galvanize the solution effort, especially
    when working with groups.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</font><font size="2"><i><b>
<p>Identifying Critical Functions (Cause &amp; Effect)</b></i></font><font SIZE="2">
When a system has a problem or disadvantage, usually there are <i>chains of
critical functions,</i> where functions are linked to each other by cause or by
requirement. If these functions can be discovered early in the problem solving
process, the “right problem” can then be solved. One of the first steps in <u>
any</u> problem solving methodology should be to identify the most important
functions through some form of cause-and-effect analysis. </p>
<p>A common mistake is to assign cause-and-effect from armchair observations. Do
your homework! Search the Internet. Read books on the subject. Talk to subject
matter experts and weigh their words carefully. (There is a lot of
misinformation <i>even among experts)</i>. Get your hands dirty with experiments
and microscopic observation. Develop theories, quantify them and verify them,
even when you think the theory of operation is obvious. It is very common that
new theories of operation will be developed. This step is usually the most time
consuming, but it yields huge benefits if the appropriate time is taken.</p>
<p>The problem solver is encouraged to do five main things: </p>
<p>1) Form theories</p>
<p>2) Quantify theories</p>
<p>3) Verify theories</p>
<p>4) Identify controlling variables</p>
<p>5) Link causal relationships </p>
</font><b>
<p>Function Chains</b><font SIZE="2"> link causal relationships. This method, as
shown in the solution process, is similar to the “Problem Formulation” step
described in <i>Systematic Innovation.</i> Below is an example of the beginning
of a Function Chain:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="01e.gif" width="558" height="360"></p>
<dir>
  <p>In this example we are considering why a common garden rake (with stiff
  tines) is poor at collecting loose debris. The independent variable of debris
  “leakage” is high. It occurs in the function of “garden rake collects loose
  debris” and is controlled by a number of independent variables such as tine
  spacing, existence of debris and stiffness of the tines. Note that a value is
  given to the dependent variable of leakage (high) and that values are given to
  the independent variables of spacing (wide), existence (exists), and stiffness
  (high). These values cause the dependent variable, leakage, to be high. In
  turn, each of these independent variables are either required to perform other
  useful functions or are designed-in for trivial reasons. For example, the
  stiff nature of the tines is required to perform another function, the
  extraction of embedded debris. The current shape of the tines may be
  unimportant.</p>
  <p>Interesting contradictions become apparent. We note that the stiffness of
  the tines is high in order to extract embedded debris, but must be low in
  order to follow the contours of the earth and extract loose debris. There are
  other reasons that the tines must be stiff, such as for arranging soil. So,
  the tines must be stiff and flexible. Later we will consider how to resolve
  this contradiction. </p>
  <p>The author encourages his students to use flow-charting software to make
  these diagrams as they can become complex and there is a need to arrange
  figures quite often.</p>
  </font><font size="2"><i><b>
  <p>Eliminate or Replace Parts</b></i></font><font SIZE="2"> Once the critical
  functions are determined, the question becomes “How can these functions be
  improved?” The improvement of a critical function is broken into two steps.
  The first step, <i>Eliminate or Replace Parts,</i> deals with determining what
  the function parts should be. <u>Only after</u> the elements are determined,
  will we concentrate on the next step, <i>Improve to the Extreme,</i> by
  boosting the function or removing flaws. Let us first consider <i>Eliminating
  or Replacing parts</i> to make the most ideal use of system resources. Each
  part (<u>product</u>, <u>modification</u>, <u>Effect</u>/<u>Tool</u> ) is
  considered in turn and the question is asked, “Do I want to eliminate or
  replace this with something more ideal?” </p>
  </font>
</dir>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="01f.gif" width="349" height="119"></p>
<font SIZE="2">
<dir>
  <p>Another name for the step <i>Eliminate and Replace Parts</i> might have
  been the Ideal Final Result, a familiar tool of classical TRIZ. The Ideal
  Final Result, is included in this step but not in its most familiar form,
  since it is broken up into smaller steps to aid visualization. The “Standard
  Solutions” of S-field analysis that deal with eliminating, redefining or
  replacing function parts are placed in this step. When combined with the
  concept of Ideal Final Result, this part of the solution process becomes very
  powerful. This is the opportunity to greatly reduce the system penalties by
  decreasing the number of elements and allowing elements take on more
  functions. </p>
  <p>The solution path depends upon whether we are considering Useful, Harmful
  or Informing (measuring or detecting) Functions. This is because the initial
  focus changes. (Note that the tab system for the binder differentiates between
  these function types). For Useful Functions, the initial focus is on the
  modification of the product. For Harmful Functions, the initial focus is on
  the tool and modification. For Informing Functions, the initial focus is on
  the tool .</p>
  </font><font size="2">
  <dir>
    <dir>
      <i><b>
      <p>Useful Functions</b></i></font><font SIZE="2"> As mentioned, the
      initial focus for a useful function is the modification of the product. In
      essence, we are asking, “What do we <u>really</u> want to have happen to
      the product?” Many problem solvers skip over this step, unaware of their
      unconscious presumptions. In doing so, some of the most powerful solutions
      are ignored. Once we are firm on the most desirable outcome, we can ask
      how the modification to the product will be accomplished. </p>

      <dir>
        <dir>
          <dir>
            <p>The Ideal Product</b><font SIZE="2"> The first question that we
            ask ourselves is “What product do we <u>really</u> want to modify?”
            </p>
            <dir>
              <dir>
                </font><b>
                <p>Non-Transmission Product</b><font SIZE="2"> If the tool is
                currently operating on a transmission element, we consider
                bypassing the transmission and operating more directly on the
                product that the transmission operates on. This is consistent
                with the evolutionary law which states that transmission paths
                are shortened and the number of energy transformations are
                reduced. Take the example of a ships anchor. In functional
                language, the sea bed constrains or holds the anchor. The anchor
                holds or constrains the chain and the chain holds the ship. By
                realizing that the anchor and the chain are transmission paths
                to the ship, we now have a decision to make. Do we want to
                constrain the anchor, the chain or the ship directly? Each
                decision begins a different solution path.</p>
                <p><img border="0" src="01g.gif" width="396" height="98"></p>
                </font><b>
                <p>Non-Existent Product</b><font SIZE="2"> Next, we ask if the
                product is normally considered waste. If it is, then we consider
                ways that it can be eliminated. Once the product is eliminated,
                the tool or system that performs the modification is no longer
                required. This changes the problem to that of removing the
                source or path of the product. For example, if there is no
                source for the leaves or there is no path for them to reach the
                lawn, then they do not need to be collected. Elimination of the
                product often leads to a direct contradiction in that the
                product must exist and must not exist. </p>
                <p><img border="0" src="01h.gif" width="180" height="103"></p>
                </font><b>
                <p>Product Requires Little or No Modification</b><font SIZE="2">
                Next, we look for ways that the product does not require the
                modification in the first place. Often there is something about
                the product that makes the modification necessary. If that one
                thing can be changed then the function may not be required. For
                example, the scales of a fish are often removed before
                consumption. If the scales were considered a delicacy, they
                would not require removing. The problem now becomes one of
                improving the texture and taste of scales.</p>
                </font>
                <p><img border="0" src="01i.gif" width="288" height="97"></p>
                <b>
                <p>Comes That Way</b><font SIZE="2"> Next, we consider a product
                that does not require the modification because it is already
                incorporated. Altshuller gives an example of the need to rapidly
                cut tubes formed by a rolling machine that processes flat metal
                stock. As the forming machine gets faster and faster, the
                cutting of the tubes becomes more difficult. The question is
                asked “What if the tube comes already cut?” Then no cutting will
                be required. Again, this method often leads to a contradiction.
                The tube comes in a cut condition, but it must not because it
                arrives as flat stock on rolls. (In Altshullers book, the
                contradiction is finally resolved by cutting the flat stock, but
                only partially. The final cut comes from a rapid pull of an
                electromagnet).</p>

                Again, no new Fields or Tool are required. On page 10 of <i>

                <p>In the book <i>Creativity as an Exact Science</i>, an example
                is given of lightning rods being used to protect radio
                telescopes from lightening. The problem is that when metallic
                rods are constructed to safely conduct the electrons, the rods
                corrupt the radio signals from space. This example is often used
                to illustrate the concept of Ideal Final Result. Unfortunately,
                for many students, this conceptual leap is too great. Use of
                Abundant Native Fields provides a smaller step towards the Ideal
                final Result. </p>
                <p>If we have been following the steps, we will have already
                recognized that the ideal product that is being modified is the
                electrons of the lightening bolt. The useful modification is to
                change their trajectory or to conduct the electrons.</p>

                <p>Now, we search for a Tool to deliver this modification. The
                question is poised “Is there a tool in the system or
                super-system that <i>already</i> delivers the required
                modification, even poorly?” The answer is Yes, the air already
                conducts the electrons, though with little control.” Thus, a new
                solution path is created. In the next step, we will see how this
                function can be boosted to give more control to the trajectory

                <p>If there were not a tool which already delivered the
                modification we would search for one in the vicinity by looking
                for abundant native fields. We would have asked, “what abundant
                native fields can change the trajectory of electrons.” Examining
                the table of fields found on page 10, we might recognize that
                electrostatic and magnetic fields have the potential to change
                the trajectory of electrons. Are these fields abundant? Yes,
                both are abundant but self- generated and poorly controlled. In
                other words, the electrons, themselves will deliver the
                modification by changing the trajectory of the electrons. </p>
                <p><img border="0" src="01q.gif" width="132" height="125"></p>
                <p>At this point, we may be scratching our heads over how air or
                electrons could be used to change the trajectory of air. That is
                expected because we are taking small steps toward the solution.
                The solution may not be apparent at this point. Take heart. In
                the next step <i>Improve to the Extreme,</i> we will examine how
                these functions are boosted to give a more complete solution.

                must first be understood.<b> </b><u>Analogous tools</u> modify
                <u>analogous products</u>. An analogous product is one that
                requires the same modification as the product in question. For
                example, consider the removal of a sliver. We ask “What other
                products require the same modification as the sliver (removal)
                while firmly embedded in a much larger object?” Products such as
                nails and weeds come to mind. Nails and weeds are analogous to
                our sliver in the context of the modification (removal). Now, we
                consider the tools which deliver the modifications to these
                analogous products. Claws on crowbars and hammers remove nails
                from larger objects. Forked digging tools likewise remove weeds.
                Next we transfer the Tool or part of the Tool to the new
                situation. The final Tool is a mini-claw which removes the
                sliver.</p>

                harmful function. Because they are not in equilibrium, the
                harmful function predominated. For instance, wear is actually
                the process of removing <u>and</u> adding material. The amount
                that is removed is more than the amount added. If we can boost
                the useful component of this equilibrium state, then we can
                perform a useful function.</p>

                is to multiply the flaw in a useful way. For example, a blade
                cuts off a piece of plastic pipe. In the process, the pipe is
                deformed on one side. Although this flaw may not reduce the
                usefulness of the pipe, it is unsightly. This flaw is improved
                by multiply it around the whole pipe, thus creating a pleasant

                The final method for making a harmful modification useful is to
                perform it more accurately. Many harmful actions are harmful
                only because of the variation. The task that remains is to
                identify where or when the task should be performed precisely to
                make it useful. This method is a subset of making adjustable.

        steps. For instance, in useful functions, we considered products which
        required no modification. Here we consider tools which require no
        detection or measurement. There is nearly a one-to-one correspondence

<p>Improve to the Extreme</font></b><font SIZE="2"> (It is assumed, beyond this
point ,that the Tool, Modification and Product will be preserved). </font></i>
<font SIZE="2">Once we have eliminated or replaced function parts, there is
usually something which is undesirable about the function. For instance, the
performance of the function may require too much energy or time. </p>
<p>The focus in this step is to concentrate on this one function and its
improvement. It will be improved to the extreme without consideration for
anything else that might become worse. It is precisely this form of extreme
thinking which allows the formation <i>many</i> useful contradictions. </p>
<p>We are about to create a diagram whose form is very useful and bears
repeating. It includes the function, the improvement, the controlling variables
and the contradiction. Improving the function to the extreme is performed in
three steps: </p>
</font>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p><b>Identify the Improvement (Dependant Variable)</b><font SIZE="2"> This
    step requires that we first determine the <i>dependent variables</i> of the
    flaw that we want to improve. In this case, we are considering the function
    of a rake to collect loose debris. Since we are using a garden rake rather
    than a leaf rake, the rake does not collect as much as we would like on each
    pass. We want to improve the “leakage” of debris past the tines. In doing
    this, we also consider the ideal outcome. In this case, “ideal outcome”
    means an enduring solution. If possible, we would like all of the debris to
    be collected on each pass.</p>
    <b>
    <p><img border="0" src="01ac.gif" width="471" height="138"></p>
    </b></font><b>
    <p>Identify Controlling (Independent) Variables</b><font SIZE="2"> Next we
    determine the <i>independent variables</i> used to control the improvement.
    We can look at this several ways. Most people simply start with intuitive
    guesses. If we were going to write an equation, what would “leakage” be a
    function of? Each of the variables of the equation would be candidate
    variables which control the leakage of the rake. If we have gone to the
    trouble of developing models, we can often use input variables from these
    models. Without quantitative data, we can still consider variables that we
    know from experience or from crude experiments. On the function diagram, we
    write that leakage is a function of those things which we have identified
    through the given methods. We note that were the tine spacing closer, less
    debris would slip through. If the tines followed the unevenness of the
    ground, it would collect more efficiently. Also, if the ground were more
    flat, there would be no need to follow it so closely.</p>
    <p><img border="0" src="01ad.gif" width="261" height="126"></p>
    <p>Having exhausted our own knowledge, we turn to the Table of Controlling
    Variables which are on the next nine pages of <i>Breakthrough Thinking</i>.
    Sub-steps are given with each controlling variable to make the
    identification of each Controlling Variable more clear. </p>
    <p>It is noted that this table is mostly a derivative of the “Standard
    solutions.” That is because a large part of the Standard Solutions already
    deal with the <u>control</u> of functions. Since we have already used the
    Standard Solutions that deal with the replacement of function parts, and
    moved them forward in the thinking process, what remains are the controlling
    variables that can be used to improve the function. Indeed, <u>almost every</u>
    method for controlling a function can be found in the Standard Solutions.</p>
    <p>In its original form the Standard Solutions contained solutions with the
    contradictions already removed. A notable case for this is the addition of
    internal, external, and environmental additives. In Contrast, the Table of
    Controlling Variables assumes that to improve the specific dependent
    variable, the <u>whole</u> tool or product is made of the required
    substance. This causes all kinds of problems. The removal of the
    contradiction is delayed in favor of creating a greater number of ways to
    resolve the contradiction than those included in the Standard Solutions.</p>
    <p>Experience shows that using the Table of Controlling Variables will help
    the problem solver uncover several unanticipated ways to control the
    function. We note that the debris has uneven shapes and would be collected
    better if it were aligned more favorably with the tines. If there were less
    debris, there would be less leakage. If the debris shapes and sizes were
    more favorable, it would collect better. And, if the debris were light, the
    tines would have less tendency to roll over it.</p>
    <p><img border="0" src="01ae.gif" width="261" height="185"></p>
    <p>Finally we consider each variable in turn and ask the question: What is
    this variable measured relative to? Consider changing this “relative to”
    variable in addition to the others. This is part of “Doing the Reverse.” If
    the ground were flexible or easily penetrated (soft), there would be no need
    for the tine flexibility. If the tines were instantaneously uneven to match
    the shape of the ground, there would be no need for the ground to be even.
    If the tines were heavy compared to the debris, it would have less tendency
    to roll over the debris.</p>

    <p><img border="0" src="01af.gif" width="295" height="246"></p>
    </b></font><b>
    <p>Drive Variable Values to the Extreme<font SIZE="2"> </font></b>
    <font SIZE="2">Finally, the variable values are driven to the extreme to
    improve function flaws. This is done without consideration for anything else
    that might get worse. Focusing this way is precisely what is needed to break
    psychological inertia. </p>
    <p>When we drive a controlling variable to the extreme, something else
    usually gets worse, or it appears impossible. Thus we see that the variable
    must have the new value and it must not. Without noting the reason that the
    extreme value will not work, we include the anti-value in the diagram and
    thus capture the contradiction as a natural result of this step. </p>
    <p><img border="0" src="01ag.gif" width="508" height="247"></p>
    <p>Infrequently, a variable can be pushed to the extreme without affecting
    anything else. If this happens, consider yourself lucky.</p>
    <p>Sometimes we do not know why such a solution wouldn’t work. Fortunately,
    others are always on hand to point out the fallacy of our thinking. “That
    won’t work because….” Criticisms are often a good way to discover
    contradictions.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</font><font size="2"><i><b>
<p>Resolve Contradictions</b></i></font><font SIZE="2"> While improving to the
extreme, it is common to develop many contradictions. Each of these
contradictions represents a new branch or solution path. Classical TRIZ
considers three types of contradictions, Administrative, Technical and Physical.
</p>
<p>The Administrative Contradiction states that there is a problem with an
unknown solution. This form of contradiction informs us of little and is ignored
here. </p>
<p>The Technical Contradiction states that as something improves something else
gets worse. In the rake example, we could have stated that the tines needed to
be flexible and stiff. No rational was given in the function diagram. In
reality, the tines need to be flexible to collect and they need to be rigid in
order to extract embedded debris from the ground. The resulting Technical
Contradiction is: as collecting improves, extracting becomes worse. (No mention
of tine stiffness is included).</p>
<p>The Physical Contradiction states that the value of a controlling variable
must be either one value and an extremely different value referred to as the
“anti-value” or “anti-property” (usually the opposite or null value). In the
rake example, we developed several Physical Contradictions. For instance, the
tines must be stiff and flexible.</p>
<p>In this text, <u>Technical Contradictions are not articulated</u> in favor of
Physical Contradictions for the following reasons:</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>An acknowledgement of at least one thing that gets worse, when we drive a
    controlling variable to the extreme, is usually sufficient. </p>
    <p>Technical contradictions arise <i>from</i> physical contradictions and
    not the reverse. In other words, Physical Contradictions are not discovered
    by peeling away the layers of the technical contradiction, as implied by
    some texts. Note that in the example of the rake, we <u>first</u> drive the
    controlling variable of tine stiff ness to the extreme <u>and then</u> look
    around to see what got worse. (It is interesting to note that some
    algorithms for creating the Technical Contradiction inadvertently create a
    Physical Contradiction <u>first</u> and then deduce the Technical
    Contradiction). </p>
    <p>Most algorithms strive to develop <u><i>the</i></u> Technical
    Contradiction. Actually, for some Physical Contradictions, <i>several</i>
    Technical Contradictions can be formed. In other words, there may be <i>
    several</i> reasons that an object cannot be both hot and cold. Since we
    have shown that it is easy to develop multiple Physical Contradictions, the
    resulting number of Technical Contradictions increases the complexity of the
    solution process.</p>
    <p>Creation of the Technical Contradiction does not increase the ability of
    the problem solver to directly visualize the solution. Although it appears
    that the problem is made more difficult by forming the Physical
    Contradiction, the problem solver is brought much closer to the solution
    because of the <u>enhanced ability to visualize the solution.</u> If an
    object needs to be both flexible and stiff, the Table of Contradictions
    brings us directly to a visual possibilities for solutions. For instance, if
    an object must be both sharp and blunt, visual images can be created
    directly from the application of suggestions from the table. </p>
    <p>The Table of Contradictions is so rich with possibilities for solutions
    that the Contradiction Matrix is not required. This can be illustrated by
    the well known example of driving piles to support piers. In order to drive
    the pier into the seabed, a pile driver is used. Driving the pile can be
    difficult when the seabed is dense or rocky. Following is the function which
    describes the problem. The improvement is ease of penetration.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Note that one way to drive the function to the extreme is to make the
    pile sharp. Unfortunately, a sharp pile continues to sink once a heavy
    structure is placed on top. The Physical Contradiction is that the pile must
    be both sharp and blunt. Please scan the Table of Contradictions in <i>
    Breakthrough Thinking</i> and note how many solutions to this problem are
    used as examples. </p>
    <p>The first step to resolving the physical contradiction is to consider the
    various tools at a higher level. Four considerations are given when
    something else gets worse.</p>

      <dir>
        </b></font><b>
        <p>Reduce the Cost Penalty</b><font SIZE="2"> Often the contradiction
        arises that an improvement must be made, but the cost appears to get
        much worse. In this case, any new costly objects must take on additional
        functions. A good example of this is the recent introduction of solar
        panels that double as roof tiles. If a new house is being built, or an
        existing house requires re-tiling, the cost penalty of the separate
        systems are shared, thus dramatically reducing the combined cost.</p>
        </font><b>
        <p>Fix the New Offending Function</b><font SIZE="2"> If no solution can
        be found in the Table of Contradictions, identify the function that gets
        worse and begin the solution process again at Eliminating and Replacing
        Function Parts.</p>
        </font><b>
        <p>Introduction of New Functions<font SIZE="2"> </font></b>
        <font SIZE="2">Sometimes, the only thing that gets worse is that while
        we know that a controlling variable must be driven to the extreme, we do
        not have a way in mind to make this happen. This requires the
        introduction of new functions. Since the function is known, we move back
        to the step of Eliminating and Replacing Function Parts for Useful
        Functions. Here we consider the ideal modification and the ideal tool to
        deliver this new modification. </p>
        </font><b>
        <p>Table of Contradictions<font SIZE="2"> </font></b><font SIZE="2">The
        Table of Contradictions (Physcical) is the most common method for
        resolving contradictions. The contradiction is that a controlling
        variable must have a value (+) and an anti-value (-). In addition to
        solution steps, each of the methods in the Table of Contradictions gives
        an example and a diagram with contains pluses and minuses. For example:</p>
        <p><img border="0" src="01ai.gif" width="173" height="160"></p>
        <p>The diagram is used by inserting the value and anti-value into the
        diagram in place of the pluses and minuses. For example, if the
        controlling value needed to be flexible and stiff, the diagram would be
        modified in this fashion: </p>
        <p><img border="0" src="01aj.gif" width="394" height="55"></p>
        <p>The number of methods for resolving contradictions is large. Usually,
        several of the solution methods will work. Take your time with each
        solution method. Work through the steps and consider ways to make it
        work. It is rare that a contradiction cannot be resolved by at least one
        solution method from the table. As mentioned, the pier driving solution
        is used in many places to illustrate various solution methods.</p>
        <p>In classical TRIZ, the principal tools for resolving Physical
        Contradictions are separation in Space, Time, and Scale (Parts have
        anti-property of the Whole). The Table of Contradictions was mostly
        derived from these three separation principles and the 40 principles
        used to solve technical contradictions. A few tools were broken out of
        the Standard Solutions. </p>
        <p>Four categories have been added.</p>
        <dir>
          <dir>
            <i>
            <p>Separation by Scale in Time: </i>Allows for the contradiction to
            be resolved gradually as elements are added over time. A minimum of
            two elements are required</p>
            <i>
            <p>Separate in Direction Path or Plane:</i> Here it is recognized
            that an object can occupy the same space and time and exhibit both
            contradictory properties. For instance, a flat pane can be stiff
            when the force is applied in one direction and very flexible when
            applied in another direction. The <u>whole</u> pane is both flexible
            and stiff in the same time and space.</p>
            <i>
            <p>Relative Measurement Standard</i>: This method of solution also
            allows for an object to carry both conflicting properties at the
            same time and in the same space. An object floating in a liquid can
            be either heavy or light when <u>compared to</u> the density of the
            liquid it is floating in.</p>
            <i>
            <p>Field Susceptibility: </i>Allows for an object to carry both
            contradictory properties at the same time, depending upon the field
            applied.</p>

<p>Expand and Consolidate </b></i></font><font SIZE="2">To this point in the
solution-process, the focus has been on one function at a time. Next, we
consider expanding the solution to include more functionality or to consolidate
elements. Tools were drawn from S-Field analysis, earlier version of ARIZ, and
System Evolution Theory.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    </font><b><font size="2">
    <p>Expand the Solution</font> </b><font SIZE="2">At this point, the main
    disadvantage has been overcome. Now we look for ways that we can expand the
    solution out to other products or merge tools which perform different
    functions on the same product. The most important tools will be detailed
    here.</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        </font><b>
        <p>Combine Solutions </b><font SIZE="2">One of the most important
        considerations is to combine some of the best solutions to this point.
        Often, the relative strength of each solution is not known. Rather than
        testing the solutions one-at-a-time, the solutions can be combined DOE
        style. As with any experiment, we stand to learn something of the
        physics in this step.</p>

        </font><b>
        <p>Merge Different Tools </b>or<b> Make Different Tools Interact</b><font SIZE="2">
        Look at the several tools that operate on the same product. Can they be
        merged or made to Interact with each other. The example is given of wall
        anchors and drills. When a picture is hung, a hole is drilled in the
        wall and then an anchor screw is inserted. Both the drill and the screw
        operate on the wall. The wall, likewise, operates on the screw. Merging
        the drill and the screw makes the operation much faster and less complex
        to perform.</p>

        <p><img border="0" src="01al.gif" width="42" height="118"></p>
        <p>Merge the Anti-Tool</b><font SIZE="2"> Identify the opposite or
        anti-modification. Does a tool exist to perform the anti-modification?
        Combine the Tool and the Anti-Tool. If one does not exist, consider the
        possibility of creating one and then combining it with the Tool that
        performs the modification. The example is given of a common hammer which
        performs both drives nails and removes nails.</p>

    </font><b><font size="2">
    <p>Consolidate the Solution</font> </b><font SIZE="2">Most solutions are not
    as compact and efficient as they could be by this point. Consolidating
    elements that perform like functions reduces the number of elements. </p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        </font><b>
        <p>Consolidate Multiple Product and Tool Elements </b><font SIZE="2">If
        part of the tool or product can be shared between multiple elements,
        then consolidate the element. This is especially true when the solution
        involves multiplying Tool or Product elements. The example is given of a
        hammer and a pick which are combined. Two handles would be unwieldy and
        inefficient. The handles are merged.</p>

        <p>Folding Elements</b><font SIZE="2"> Folding elements into each other
        makes the system more compact. Sometimes, unexpected useful benefits
        will emerge</p>
        </font><b>
        <p>Merge with Super-System and Consolidate</b><font SIZE="2"> One of the
        most important considerations is to merge with the super-system. Often,
        the super-system will have elements which perform duplicate functions. A
        house is part of the super-system for most refrigerators. What elements
        in the house are duplicated in the refrigerator? The structure and
        insulation are duplicated. If the refrigerator merges with the house, it
        can make use of the house structure and insulation. </p>

<p>Solution Branches</font></b><font SIZE="2"> Each decision point in this
linear sequence of tools falls in a logical and natural order. The output of
each step is required in order to move to the next. That output may be assumed
or actively created. For example, consider a problem solver who wants to start
solving an apparent contradiction with no other consideration. He or she has <i>
already assumed</i> a critical function along with its attending parts (product,
modification, effect and tool) as well as a controlling variable which has an
extreme property. </p>
<p>The following figure shows the branching of the solution paths at each
decision point for a Useful Function. (Branching is slightly different for
Harmful and Informing functions). Each step allows for multiple decisions, with
each decision forming a new solution path.</p>
