  <p>1 How Triz started at LRPS</p>
</dir>
</b>
<p>The Industrial Automation Research Laboratory in Strasbourg (LRPS) is
principally involved in complex problems linked with the design and development
of products and production systems, taking all the technical, human,
organisational and economic aspects into account. To succeed in its aims, LRPS
has set up a team of researcher-lecturers from the ENSAIS Engineering School (Ecole
Nationale des Arts et Industrie de Strasbourg), who stem from a broad range of
disciplines in engineering sciences, social sciences and the humanities.
Furthermore, the laboratory works in close cooperation with Department for
Applied Economics and Theory BETA UA CNRS 1237 (Bureau d'Economie Théorique et
Appliquée) at Louis Pasteur University in Strasbourg and ENSAIS' Computing and
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (LIIA). LRPS is involved in a number of
industrial projects through the application of its research. The
researcher-lecturers at LRPS are particularly keen on transferring the know-how
they gain from their research to the industrial world in the shortest time
possible. </p>
<p>Research topics are constantly enhanced and coordinated through
multi-disciplinary projects as demonstrated in the figure below:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Product and production system design</p>
</i></font>
<p>The purpose behind the work on product design is to develop methods and tools
which assist in the Innovation and Design processes for products and systems.
The work related to innovation is focused on the TRIZ theory and deals with the
first phases of the design process. Our aim in terms of mechanical design is to
come up with rapid development methods for products both in the definition phase
for graphic models and the validation of the recommended solutions through
simulation.</p>
<font size="2">
<p>The fields of application for production system design as defined by our
laboratory, cover the production system as a whole, i.e. the sub-systems
concerned with information, decision-making and the operating system. In this
area, our aim is to develop analysis tools and methods for production system
design. Over the last few years, we have developed three main areas of research.</p>
</font><font SIZE="2"><b>
<p>Area 1: Modelising systems and the activities inherent therein</p>
</b></font><font size="2">
<p>The purpose of this research is, firstly, to develop methods and tools which
can provide a visual representation of production systems and activities and how
they are organised and, secondly, to examine how modelising tools can be
utilised in projects where a socio-technical system is totally or partially
reorganised. For specific crafts, we are also developing system ontology based
on general methods for modelising production systems.</p>
</font><font SIZE="2"><b>
<p>Area 2: Organisation of flows</p>
</b></font><font size="2">
<p>The aim of research in this area is to control the evolution of operating
flows in a production system. More precisely, it deals with analysing whether
operating flows are adequate in terms of the flow organisation modes, defining
the best flow organisation modes for a system, analysing the flows and the
concept of activities and jointly developing the operating flows and the flow
management system. </p>
</font><font SIZE="2"><b>
<p>Area 3: Designing an information system </p>
</b></font><font size="2">
<p>This research aims to define and provide instruments for an open meta-method
for designing information systems using the principles laid down in existing
methods and which can integrate principles generated by future methods. </p>
<p>Education and design</p>
<p>This topic covers, firstly, all the problems encountered when teaching design
at educational institutions and secondly the problem of managing individual and
collective skills in a company environment in the field of design.</p>
<p>Innovation management</p>
<p>This research topic is dealt with in partnership with BETA. It covers both
the macro-economic dimensions of innovation management and the organisational
dimensions of innovation management on a company scale, studying the
characteristics which lead to success or failure, building decision-making tools
and the procedures which go with the innovation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TRIZ</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We discovered TRIZ by chance in the framework of the research work carried
out by D. Cavallucci for his thesis. His research then took a turn to focus more
on how to integrate the simplest problem-solving methods put forward by TRIZ
into product design methods so as to improve the solution-seeking phases. Little
by little, interest in TRIZ grew and spread to the entire laboratory when we
realised how much TRIZ could contribute to our various fields of research. We
also realised how well the multi-disciplinary skills of our laboratory and our
network of partner laboratories corresponded to certain developments currently
occurring with TRIZ. We therefore decided to set up a research team on TRIZ
whose purpose was to develop new research on TRIZ, but also to assist in
transferring TRIZ to other fields of research, in particular those carried out
by LRPS. More details on the current objectives and research work will be given
later on in this presentation. </p>

  <p>2 TRIZ and the educational project at ENSAIS</p>
</dir>
</b>
<p>ENSAIS trains engineers in a number of fields such as mechanics, civil
engineering, electrical engineering, energy and architecture. Planned recent
developments at ENSAIS include setting up courses for specific branches with a
common core curriculum so that each student can gain in-depth professional and
technological skills founded on a broad-based training background. The new
reform will give students greater autonomy by decreasing actual class time and
inciting a project-based approach to their studies. Our objective is to enhance
the efficiency of our training courses so that the future engineers can develop
a finer grasp of scientific knowledge and speed up the learning process for the
know-how they will be required to take on board both during and after their
education. ENSAIS is also contributing to a nation-wide think tank in France on
technology teaching practices.</p>
<p>In the broadest terms, the TRIZ theory explores the general question of
problem-solving in innovation. How should problems be analysed? How can we
develop a creative spirit? How can we link up the know-how inherent in the
search for scientific and technical information with a thought process that
addresses problems in a rigorous yet unconventional manner? It is by putting
forward these questions that TRIZ finds its appeal in the development of the
creative spirit and provides an original, practical approach by making full use
of the teachings of problem-solving methods for inventions in the field of
technology, engineering sciences and cognitive sciences. Through broadening the
scope of the work on TRIZ, LRPS, wishes to invest in studying this aspect,
through our researchers in educational sciences, with the aim of developing
knowledge and know-how on teaching TRIZ (in basic education and continuing
education) and, more generally speaking, on training that can further design
development for both engineers and architects. Cooperation projects with foreign
universities are currently underway on this theme. </p>
<p>The educational project at ENSAIS is backed by the French Ministry of
Education.</p>

  <b>
  <p>3 Spreading the news about TRIZ</p>
</dir>
</b>
<p>ENSAIS and the LRPS team are also working on spreading information about TRIZ
in the industrial sector. For instance, ENSAIS was a driving force behind the
founding of the TRIZ France association, of which it is currently a highly
active member. </p>
<p>ENSAIS, in partnership with ADEPA, the Region of Alsace and DRIRE Alsace,
carried out a transfer programme in 1999-2000 to move ARIZ into small and
medium-sized concerns on the one hand, and research into the various uses of the
TRIZ theory for companies in general. Actions similar to the Alsace project have
been launched in the Regions of Aquitaine and Rhône Alpes. ENSAIS has undertaken
part of the training for these programmes.</p>
<p>To follow up the programmes communicating the TRIZ theory more efficiently,
assess their impact and remain attentive to the evolving needs of the market, a
monitoring process has been set up to record how the transfers and training
linked to TRIZ are perceived. This monitoring process will contribute to LRPS'
research work on the managerial and organisational impact of using TRIZ, which
will be studied in the framework of a doctoral thesis currently underway. </p>

  <p>4 Current research and orientations</p>
  <dir>
    <p>4.1 Research with and for TRIZ</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our first contact with TRIZ began in 1996. Until 1999, just
two members of the laboratory team were involved with TRIZ. In March 2000, LRPS
decided to include TRIZ in its research projects and to conduct research with
and for TRIZ. A dozen extra researchers were trained in using TRIZ methods and
ARIZ. We were helped in this by N. Khomenko who joined our team in March 2000.
Backed by our growing understanding of TRIZ tools, we are beginning to study the
impact and use of TRIZ in our fields of research. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the field of designing information systems, we have
therefore used the analytical approach to problem formulation put forward by
TRIZ to reformulate the research problems in the field, highlight whole vistas
of research which have escaped the notice of the scientific community and which
are necessary to make a qualitative leap in the progress of research in this
field. We have therefore been able to set up a research programme in the field
of information systems. It may be reutilized at a later stage of this research.
A similar approach has been conducted in the field of designing production
systems, especially for operating systems. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our educational sciences research team has positioned TRIZ in
relation to the various approaches to problem-solving and inventive processes.
It is now beginning to explore the relation between innovation training and
TRIZ, in particular within the framework of vocational training, by focusing on
the knowledge roused by a change in paradigm (meta-cognitive level). This work
must be broadened to include a reflection on innovation management in an
industrial context, where the organisational dimension of the knowledge network,
industrial strategy and corporate culture (relation to knowledge) become key
parameters. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our management sciences researchers (economic management) are
currently working on the consequences of TRIZ being adopted in companies.
Following our experiments with implementing TRIZ in the industrial environment,
we have been able to identify three ways of internalising TRIZ according to the
degree of expertise acquired by the companies. We believe that it is clear that
several elements will be taken into account to induce a company to select one or
other of these adoption modes. First, the adoption method must be integrated
into a strategic process: what are the company's objectives? What are its needs
in terms of innovation management? What skills does it have at hand? The
strategic process will therefore be built up from the company's current features
and the strategic choices it will put forward. Therefore, depending on its size,
sector of activity, degree of innovation, extent of this R&amp; D and the number of
projects it has to undertake, among others, the needs, and therefore the
choices, for adopting TRIZ will differ. Another result of our experience of TRIZ
being adopted by companies is our observation of 3 types of relatively
significant incidence in terms of innovation management:</p>
<dir>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving from a follower attitude to a leader attitude:</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An increase in the number of patents applied for: </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of technological sectors covered during
    solution-seeking </p>
  </li>
</dir>
<p>Thus, we are attempting to examine how TRIZ can and will contribute to
managing the innovation process in companies. It would be useful to highlight
the dimensions which favour not only the adoption but also the successful
utilisation of TRIZ in companies. </p>
<p>The oldest work deals with integrating TRIZ in design methods and processes.
A detailed presentation of this work is scheduled during the conference (D.
Cavallucci). </p>

    <p>4.2 Research on TRIZ.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</b>
<p>Research on developing tomorrow's TRIZ presupposes a sufficient level of
training and expertise. We have therefore had to wait for the first experts
trained by the laboratory to reach a sufficiently high level so that we can
train a team dedicated to the development of tomorrow's TRIZ. To speed up the
process we have padded out our team of experts by recently welcoming D.
Kucharavy as a member. The team's precise programme of research is currently
being drawn up. It shall include three major areas:</p>
<p>Tools assisting in the formalisation of the problem model </p>
<p>Moving from the solution model to the solution itself </p>
<p>Using TRIZ in fields other that inventing technical objects, in particular in
teaching and management.</p>
