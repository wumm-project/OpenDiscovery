<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Volkswagen of Mexico S.A. de C.V, the well-known german
automotive industry has become the first company in Mexico and perhaps in Latin
America using the TRIZ methodology in order to improve its processes of
production. The line of foundry manufacture for one of its pieces of safety,
namely the steering knuckle, has presented from the beginning various quality
and operation problems. It is a strategic piece for the security of the
passengers in cars since it is closely interacting with the direction, the shock
absorbers, and with the front wheels. Two great problems have been accurately
identified: one is the slag and the other one is referring to the sand system
for the manufacture of molds. The matrix of Altshuller, a key milestone in the
TRIZ methodology for innovation technology has allowed to help for proposals of
valuable and sustainable solutions to solve these great problems that originate
scrap causes, such as “solidification shrinkage”, “sand rain” or “ porosity”.
All of these cause a high percentage of scraps or <i>reworks</i>. In this paper,
the first of them, namely the slag problem will be analyzed.</p>

<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ</i></b> is a new methodology born in Russia<i><b> (</b>called<b>
Theory of Inventive Problem Solving)</b></i>. TRIZ is a knowledge-based
technology for speed-up development of design concepts. The power of this
methodology is based in the evolution of successful products, ways to overcome
psychological barriers, and generalization of the ways used to solve several
problems in the most innovative inventions. TRIZ is able to analyze products or
process functions in order to best use its resources and identify the best
opportunities for its development. Many papers about TRIZ have been published in
difference international revues, the most important and dedicated is the
triz-journal. ( <a href="http://www.triz-journal.com">www.triz-journal.com</a> ) <font SIZE="2">[4] </p>

<dir>
  <p>1.1 Overview of the Company. </p>
</dir>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Volkswagen firm in Mexico is one of the most important
automotive industries around the country. It is conformed to a great amount of
industrial ships and various processes of production that conform everything in
an industrial system that makes the manufacture possible of the different
automobiles which, at the present time, are sold in the country. The
macro-industry of more than 15000 workers has just produced its unit number 5
million in more than 30 years of existence. It uses the most modern methods of
production and the most advanced management quality systems. It is located in
Puebla next to mountains and only 80 miles from Mexico City. [1]</p>

  <b>
  <p>1.2 The Piece. </p>
</dir>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The steering knuckle is an important part of the vehicle that
allows fixing the front wheel brakes, the motion of direction, the fixation of
the shock absorber, and the axis of impulsion. This piece is of safety
importance whereas it is subject to diverse types of strengths in different
directions and must strictly fulfill the design-required parameters. (Fig.1)</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="01.gif" width="501" height="192"></p>
<b>
<dir>
  <p>1.3 </p>
  <p>The Material</p>
</dir>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This piece is made with ductile iron. After a magnesium-based
reaction, the iron is impregnated with a large amount of nodules that present,
at the microscopic level, the appearance of spherical bubbles. These
particularities allow for ductility and resistance to the tensions. It induces
an extraordinary resistance to the breakage and/or the flexion. For that reason,
it is necessary in this process of reaction to introduce certain substances such
as carbon, silicon and others in order to give the required properties to the
piece. [1]</p>
<b>
<dir>
  <p>1.4 The Process. </p>
</dir>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The production in the foundry manufacturing line begins with
the induction furnaces that are fed mainly with new raw material, recycled
material, and scrap pieces. These furnaces melt and mix the material with other
necessary substances for the casting process (temperature&gt;1400°C). Later, the
iron-base is put under a reaction process using magnesium in order to form
nodules that allow it to acquire certain physical properties of ductility. It
allows for the manufacturing of a piece whose function is associated to diverse
efforts and tensions that cause their critical parameters and its meticulous
control. Then the casting process is performed. A casting is a metal part formed
by pouring molten metal into a sand mold. The mold is composed with two halves
that form a cavity into which the molten metal is poured. The mold forms the
external surface of the casting. If an internal cavity is required in the
casting, a core is placed inside the mold cavity, as in the case for our piece.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the metal solidifies, the mold is broken, the core
removed and the part is ready for finishing operations. The sand is then
remolded, prepared and used again in a cyclic process.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then, there is a cooling process that strips the two pieces
which are then drained: a right and a left one, totally symmetrical that
separated by a ‘branch’ that serves as a joint between both pieces (which is
known as recycled or returned material). At the same time, the sand is recovered
in order to be reused through a transportation band until the sand tower, where
the sand has already been treated with water in order to fulfill the required
humidity. Some pre-mixed substances that give the sand agglutinates properties
have also been added. The pieces, cold and clean, are tested in laboratories in
order to avoid out of specification pieces, arriving at the machine process.
Finally the pieces are re-assembled. </p>
<b>
<dir>
  <p>1.5 The Basic Problem. </p>
</dir>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The manufacturing line in its first foundry step for the
steering knuckle has been recently started. It was implemented less than a year
ago and since then a lot of problems have had to be surpassed, reflected in the
high percentage of scraps and reworks considerably increasing the operating
costs. The main causes of these scraps are the ‘solidification shrinkage’, that
is a deformation of the piece because of the metal in fusion does not fill the
mold in certain points due to a premature cooling. The ‘sand rain’ attributed to
that the molds do not have the properties with required humidity or
agglutination and thus they are deformed at the moment of the casting. In
addition to these two reasons that cause 90 % of scraps, there are also the
porosity, the struck piece, and others which causes are attributed to diverse
reasons. Nevertheless, most of those problems may be eliminated or diminished if
two great fundamental problems can be solved: the<b> slag and the recycle sand
quality</b>. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The excess of sand deposited in the hopper feeding the
induction furnaces, impregnated in the return material is certainly the main
cause. Using the Altshuller’s matrix we will able to analyze these two great
problems and we will try to propose a solution for each of them. In this paper
we will analyze only the first problem. </p>
<font size="2"><b>
<p align="left">2. ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The slag is one of the most persistent problems; it is the
impurities that are detected in the metal before the casting process. This
problem is originated mainly in the material of return or the scrap pieces that
are impregnated with an important amount of sand, as product of strips, which
cannot be easily eliminated. The slag represents a contaminant element that is
necessary to eliminate or to diminish before the casting process to avoid
scraps. From the point of view of the Altshuller’s matrix, we want to improve
the adaptability of the metal, since the slag causes the metal to not fulfill
the desired conditions for fluidity. Nevertheless, the main challenge is the
natural effect of the high temperature and conditions of the process that
prevent or make difficult any effective remedial action. <b>The ideal solution</b>
is that the scrap pieces or the material of return do not contain sand at all
[5], but it is a difficult task by the inherent conditions of the process. If we
consulted the Altshuller’s matrix in line 35 related to <b>Adaptability</b> and
column 17 referring to <b>Temperature</b>, we find the numbers 2, 27, 3, 35 that
correspond to the inventive principles suggested by the matrix. (The matrix can
be consulted and used in <font SIZE="2" COLOR="#0000ff"><u>http://www.inp.nsk.su/~dolgash/triz/index.html

<p align="left">3. ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM OF THE NON-ADHERED SAND ON </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the problem of the slag is mainly attributed to the
high sand content, the problem must be presented in such a way that the
possibility that the sand arrives at the furnaces does not exist or it arrives
only with a minimal amount. The recycled material as well as the scrap pieces
are transported in freight elevators that in addition to the material cannot
avoid to transport a great amount of sand non-adhering to the material. Let us
say that the sand adhered to the material will require other methods of solution
(section 4), but it is possible to avoid that the loose sand arrives at the
storage zone of the recovery pieces, making it very difficult to eliminate
without increasing the cost of the processing. Therefore, the following
situation exists: we would like to eliminate the undesired material during the
transport process but the amount of material to transport prevents it; that is
to say, the parameters are: line 33, <b>Ease of operation</b> and column 1, <b>

MATERIAL</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem of the adhered sand to the return material is one
of most seriousness. There is not a method that allows eliminating the sand that
contaminates the induction furnaces and therefore, increases the amount of slag
that prevents the process as a whole.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <b>ideal solution</b> would be that the premix* that
is added to the sand had the property to maintain in hot conditions its
properties of adhesion or agglutination but in cold conditions, these properties
were lost. As this solution is not sustainable (that rather corresponds to the
sand supplier), it will be necessary to consider other solutions. We will settle
this problem like a contradiction of the following way: What we want is to clean
to the surface of a movable object that is the material that is transferred to
the recovery area. Nevertheless, a resistance exists because the sand is
compacted to the material and therefore the cleaning work becomes difficult. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consulting the Altshuller’s matrix, in line 18 (Brightness)
and in column 14 (Strength) we find the numbers 35 and 19 as the inventive
principles to be applied to solve this problem. <br>

<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interpretation</b>: this principle suggests to react the sand
adhered to the material, submerging it in an acid or an alkaline liquid of a
certain concentration so when reacting, the sand becomes loose. Exactly like it
happens with grease when reacting it with liquid stove cleaner, this acquires a
favorable consistency for its cleaning without affecting the surface of the
material. This operation can be conducted by those who make the separation of
the pieces with the call “ branch” (material of return) without wasting a lot of
time or effort. </p>

  </blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Interpretation</b>: this principle is complemented with
the previous one, because once the cleaning liquid has been applied to the
material, a movement of oscillation or periodic impulses can be applied to the
deposit in order that the return material is undone of the sand that previously
has been treated. These impulses can be made in a more efficient way during
their transfer using the same energy the freight elevator does. The sand can be
eliminated by suction or by inverting the deposit with a mesh that it prevents
the material from falling. This solution is similar to the proposal for the
loosened sand, therefore, the two could be conjugated and consequently any type
of sand, either the released or the adhered one, does not arrive.</p>

<font size="2"><b>5. CONCLUSIONS</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The least expensive and fastest solution to implement is to
make an extraction by inverting the deposit, holding onto the pieces by using a
resistant mesh to unload the excess of sand. Although the most efficient
solution is to use the deposit with a bottom, which has multiple perforations,
so the sand falls into a second bottom to be inhaled or drained in a later
operation to discharge the material. This solution implies an adaptation to the
deposits of the material. If the ideal solution cannot be reached, the amount of
slag could at least be reduced in a high percentage that is generated for sand
reasons. A complementary action to assure minimum sand in the induction furnaces
that also can operate in case that the previous operations are not possible is
as follows: To modify the hopper that spills the material to the furnaces adding
a great amount of circular perforations in the base of the hopper. At the moment
it has only these perforations in a small area that is not sufficient to collect
all the sand that already is loosened in the hopper. Thus, once the scraps or
return material is deposited in the hopper, this one will be vibrated in order
to obtain an effect of sifting and eliminate portions of sand, a sand collector
will be adapted (see fig 3 and 4). This solution has been recommended and
implemented with excellent results and without investment managing to reduce the
scraps and reworks pieces from more than 10% to less than 3%. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This demonstrates how using TRIZ methodology is interesting
and how applying these concepts up to the revamping of a manufacturing chemical
process may lead to significant improvements.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It also demonstrates how a based theory approach may be
efficient for help and may be used in manufacturing industry in order to improve
end-user product, process, and processing.</p>
