<p align="left">Editor�s Note: Dr. Slocum has authored this paper as an
exploratory work demonstrating a novel application for TRIZ (Su-Field modeling
specifically). It is intended to act as a stimulant for the development of
additional novel utilizations of TRIZ. Any interest in this particular line of
research should be directed to Dr. Slocum. Dr. Slocum intends to complete this
series in 10 parts. The next philosophy to be deconstructed is open for
suggestion. </p>

<p align="left">ABSTRACT</p>
<p>Substance-Field modeling can be used in order to deconstruct philosophical
worldviews. The construction of a philosophy and even the language used to relay
the concepts can be diagrammatically deconstructed ( a la Carnap or
Wittgenstein) in order to demonstrate the technical or physical contradiction
that was resolved by the great thinker. Direct correlations with Substance-Field
analysis will be made. A model for logical constructions will be presented as
well as a standard algorithm for the decomposition and development of logical
arguments. </p>

<u>
<p>Logical Positivism (LP):</u> LP emerged from Austria and Germany during the
1920�s and was primarily focused on the logical analysis of Scientific
knowledge. LP denied the soundness of metaphysics<sup><a href="#1" name="1a">1</a></sup> and traditional philosophy;
the LP�s asserted that many philosophical problems are indeed meaningless.
According to LP, there are two sources of knowledge: logical reasoning and
empirical experience. The former is analytic a priori, while the latter is
synthetic a posteriori.<sup><a href="#2" name="2a">2</a></sup></p>

</b>
<p>A statement is meaningful if and only if it can be proved true or false by
means of experience - this assertion is called the <u>Verifiability Principle</u>.<sup><a href="#3" name="3a">3</a></sup></p>

<p>The absence of an observable phenomenon would indicate a failure to meet the
verifiability principle or possible a measurement and/or detection problem. The
connection between objects (S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>) may exist but be unobservable. This
would yield a situation in which the connection could be pointed a priori
utilizing logical reasoning.</p>

</font><b>
<p align="left">The unobserved phenomenon is pointed to exist (~M) based on
logical reasoning. This process can be demonstrated as:</p>
</b>
<p>When we are confident that understanding of a situation is precise?
Obviously, if and only if we are able to precisely describe the conditions in
which it is possible to answer in the affirmative, or respectively, the
conditions in which it is necessary to answer with the negative. The <u>meaning</u>
of a situation is defined only through the specification of those conditions.
The definition of the circumstances under which a statement is true is exactly
equivalent to the definition of its meaning. �� a statement has a meaning if and
only if the fact that it is true makes a verifiable difference.�<sup><a href="#4" name="4a">4</a></sup></p>

<p align="left">~M exists if and only if the interaction between S1 and S2 is
modified in some manner by ~M. If three is no interaction (see Figure 1.0) then
~M does not exist.</p>
</b>
<p>The strength of the verification relies on the strength of the experiment of
observation. Metaphysical statements are meaningless. The traditional role of
philosophy is also meaningless, the only role of philosophy is the clarification
of the meaning of statements.</p>

<p align="left">M, M�, or M� do <u>NOT</u> exist without a corresponding F,
F�, or F�. The validity of M rests on the strength of the logical construct
under lying it (see Figure 3.0).</p>
</b>
<p>Philosophy, then, is the activity by means of which the meanings of
statements/interactions is clarified and defined. If Substance-field modeling is
indeed efficient at this clarification and definition then you could call it a
philosophical methodology. A scientific theory is an axiomatic system that
obtains an empirical interpretation through appropriate statements called rules
of correspondence, which establish a correlation between real objects and the
abstract concepts of the theory.</p>

</font>
<b>
<p align="left">Figure 6.0</p>
<p align="left">a and a� are abstract concepts while S1 and S2 are real
objects. The Su-field model, they also indicate the correlation between real
objects and abstract concepts. M is synthetic and a/a� are analytic.</p>
</b>
<p>The language of a theory includes two types of terms: observational (M) and
theoretical (a or a�) (see Figure 6.0). The statements of a theory are divided
into two groups: analytic and synthetic. Observational terms denote objects or
properties that can be directly measured (or observed), while theoretical terms
denote objects or properties we cannot observe or measure but can only be
inferred from direct observations (see Figure 6.0).</p>
<p>As a (or a�) is observed directly or indirectly (if possible) it moves from
the realm of abstract and theoretical to the realm of real and observable. To
maintain the abstract component, a new Su-field model must be created:</p>

<p align="left"><img SRC="Image198.gif" width="350" height="240"></p>
</font><b>
<p align="left">Figure 7.0</p>
</b>
<p>Analytic statements are a priori and their veracity is based on the syntax of
the language; contrarily, synthetic statements depend on experience (also the
only method to acknowledge their veracity) (see Figure 6.0).</p>
<p>This construction concerning the structure of scientific theory was proposed
by Reichenbach and Carnap in 1928.<sup><a href="#5" name="5a">5</a></sup> <sup>
<a href="#6" name="6a">6</a></sup>The main points of this structure are:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>DISTINCTION BETWEEN OBSERVATINAL AND THEORETICAL TERMS</li>
  <li>DISTINCTION BETWEEN SYNTHETIC AND ANALYTIC STATEMENTS</li>
  <li>DISTINCTION BETWEEN AXIOMS AND RULES OF CORRESPONDENCE</li>
  <li>DEDUCTIVE NATURE OF SCIENTIFIC THEORIES</li>
</ol>

<p align="left"><img SRC="Image199.gif" width="384" height="151"></p>
</font><b>
<p align="left">Figure 8.0</p>
</b>
<p>Rules of correspondence give an empirical meaning to theoretical terms and
all analytic, while theoretical axioms express the observational portion of the
theory and are synthetic. A theory must be a deductive system or syntax
degrades.</p>

<p align="left">If the relationship between S1 and S2 is incorrect, then the
S1-S3 correlation will be affected. If a� or b are invalid then the F-F�
correlation will be invalid.</p>
</b>
<p>The distinction between observational and theoretical terms depend on the <u>
verifiability principle.</u> A statement is meaningful only if it is verifiable;
but, in scientific theories, there are many statements which are <u>not</u>
verifiable<sup><a href="#8" name="8a">8</a></sup>. These statements are too abstract for a direct test (meaningless).
According to Schlick, the principles of a scientific theory are not statements,
but rules of inference; hence, the problem of meaning does not arise<sup><a href="#9" name="9a">9</a></sup>. Another
solution was proposed by Neurath: the terms which belong to the abstract
language of a scientific theory are explicitly definable in a restricted
language whose terms describe directly observable and theoretical terms arose.
Carnap realized that theoretical terms are <u>not</u> definable by observational
terms. All theoretical terms are removable from a scientific theory.</p>
<p>This hypothesis is supported by two resultants of formal logic:</p>
<dl>
  <dd>1.0 Craig Theorem</dd>
  <dd>2.0 Ramsey Statement</dd>
</dl>
<u>
<p>Craig Theorem</p>
</u>
<p>Let A and B be two sets of statements, so that B is a logical consequence of
A. Craig proved that (i) there is a set C of statements whose terms are common
to A and B, (ii) C is a logical consequence of A, and (iii) B is a logical
consequence of C. Therefore, if A is the set of axioms of a scientific theory
and B is the set of observational statements implied by A, then there is a set
C, whose terms are common to A and B and thus they are the observational terms
which occur in the axioms, so that C entails B and is a consequence of A.
Therefore, it is possible to translate a scientific theory into a purely
observational language without any loss of deductive power. </p>

<u>
<p>Ramsey Statement</p>
</u>
<p>The Ramsey statement was utilized by Carnap for the division of the axioms of
a theory into two sets: A and R, so that R contains only observational terms and
expresses the empirical portion of the theory, while A is analytic and defines
the meaning of theoretical terms. Given a theory T, it is thus possible to build
a theory T� without theoretical terms so that T and T� are equivalent with
respect to observational statements, that is every observational statement. O is
a logical consequence of T if and only if it is a logical consequence of T�. </p>

<p align="left">Ramsey Statement as it applies to Su-field analysis</p>
</b>
<p>Consider the observational steps (R) as the substances involved (S1 and S2)
and their interaction (if physically manifested). The theoretical aspect (A) is
supposed as the force (Fx) driving the physical manifestation (M). The prime
proven yielding Fx as a resultant, according to Ramsey, would then be
equivalent, at least in concept, to Fy if Mx is equivalent to My. This principal
may allow for the simplification of comparative analysis of Su-field models (as
the theoretical aspect, A, need not be considered).<sup><a href="#10" name="10a">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Logical Positivism assumes that a theory is a deductive system. Therefore,
observational techniques would yield data indicative of the deductive path that
will result in a perceived reality that closely mimics actual reality.</p>
<p>This enhances the importance of the measurement and detection standards found
in Class 4 of the 76 Standard Solutions.</p>
<p>I have attempted to provide an analysis of logical positivism based on
Substance-field analysis. Clearly, I could continue as I have merely covered a
few of the primary tenants of logical positivism. This work will continue as I
seek the correlations between Su-Field analysis and other philosophies.</p>
