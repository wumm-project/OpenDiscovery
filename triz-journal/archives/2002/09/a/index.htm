</font>
<p>The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving provides a method of creating a model
(in addition to many other data based problem solving tools) of any existing
system (technical or non-technical). There are 76 standard solutions that may be
utilized when the model of your system has deficiencies or inadequacies but not
necessarily a technical or physical contradiction (TC or PC). These solutions
transformations are grouped into five major classes. Class 4 is dedicated
precisely to measuring and detecting and can offer highly innovative resolutions
to previously intractable measuring and/or detecting systems. </p>

<p ALIGN="left">INTRODUCTION</p>
</font>
<p>Dr. Genrich Altshuller developed the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving in
the former Soviet Union beginning in 1946. This theory constitutes a data based
approach to innovatively resolving difficult problems. At the foundation of the
theory is the realization that nearly all innovative patents contained a
resolution to some type of contradiction (technical (TC) and/or physical (PC)).
Fundamental principles for problem resolution were cultivated from the review of
approximately 400,000 patents (initial research, the total number of reviewed
patents now approaches 4,000,000. There have been only minor modifications to
the basic principles based on this additional research.). These patents were
classified according to their inventive level (specifically defined in the
portion of the theory applicable to this) and the most innovative levels (~21%)
were selected for further analysis. This analysis yielded 40 principles of
resolution that could be applied to any generic problem formulation. The theory
was continuously developed and other more advanced principles were identified
that were utilized to solve those problems characteristically more difficult
than the lower levels of difficulty. A portion of this work was associated with
the minimum required technical system. The minimum technical system was found to
consist of a field (F) and two substances (S<sub>1</sub> and S2). The
interrelationship is indicated in Figure 1.0:</p>

<p align="left">Figure 1.0: Standard minimum required technical system
graphically represented according to Su-Field Principles.</p>
<p>This standard minimum system and transformations of it (which is a generic
formulation, according to the corollaries associated with Su-Field Analysis, for
your specific problem) became the foundation of a set of standard solutions (76
Standard Solutions) that is effectively utilized for manipulation with the
intent of the model transformations analogically resulting in solutions to your
specific problem. These solutions, or standard transformations, are grouped into
five classes, see Figure 2.0.</p>

<p>PROBLEMS WITHOUT CONTRADICTIONS?</p>
</b>
<p>Overcoming contradictions solves both simple and complex problems. But why do
contradictions occur? Because, striving to improve the world around us, the
inventor demands a lot from technical objects. This is logical, for, in order to
meet the increasing demand, technical systems (TS) should constantly increase in
efficiency (or decrease in harmful, or redundant, properties). This means that
one group of inventive problems focuses on improving the existing technical
systems. Once involved in the technological evolution process, they start facing
contradictions. The increasing demand can not always be met by improving the
existing TS. This gives rise to a question: are there problems where no
contradiction can be defined?</p>
<font FACE="Arial CYR" SIZE="2">
    </font><u>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Example</u>: In the course of reconstruction, a match factory was
    equipped with high-performance machines that doubled the factory’s
    production rate. Yet, there was an operation that slowed down the whole
    process: packing the ready matches into boxes. The old machines could not
    cope with twice as much production; the lack of space made it impossible to
    install two packing lines. Finally a decision was made to remove the
    out-of-date packing equipment. The old equipment had some deficiencies too:
    it was ‘blind’ and would often pack reject matches without heads or pack the
    wrong number of matches. Therefore, it became urgent to find an accurate
    method for packing millions of matches into boxes. There was a requirement
    for a system that would detect faulty matches.</p>
    </blockquote>
<p>There is no visible contradiction in this problem, but still there is the
need to find a solution. The introduction of a small amount of ferromagnetic
powder (application of a standard form Class 4, Group 4.4) to the ignition
compound gives slight magnetic properties to each match. This is enough to
orient the matches in a magnetic field and pack them much faster and with much
higher accuracy (for a magnet of certain surface square attracts a fixed number
of matches). </p>
<p>Let us analyze the problem and its solution in detail. First, as the
conditions of the problem suggest, there is nothing to improve: the old TS was
dismantled. Therefore, a new system should be created. The matches are there,
but what are we supposed to do with them? Should we count, orient, or package
the matches? The problem was solved using the introduction of a ferromagnetic
powder into the ignition compound of the match heads and using a magnetic field
to create a system that could easily detect and control defect reduction in the
packaged system.</p>
<p>In the beginning, there was one substance (the matches, S1), and in the end
there were two substances (the matches, S1, and the ferromagnetic powder, S2)
and one field (magnetic, FM). We will use the following symbols to represent the
system as depicted in Figure 4.0:</p>

</font>
<p align="left">Figure 4.0: Initial Su-Field model and the synthesis to a
complete model.</p>
<p>Let us now look at how the system works. The magnetic field (FM) acts on the
ferromagnetic powder, S2, which, in turn, acts on the matches (S1). Graphically
the operation can be represented as depicted in Figure 5.0.</p>

</font>
<p align="left">Figure 5.0: Su-field model for the example system.</p>
<p>In other words, we worked from a single element (S1) towards a system of
interacting elements (S1, S2, and FM). A double arrow (to avoid confusion with
arrows that indicate the interaction between elements) indicates this
transition. The entire process of transition can be as displayed in Figure 6.0.</p>

solution model using Class 4 Group 4.4 from the 76 Standard Solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this resembles the symbolic representations of a chemical reaction. Two
elements (e.g. oxygen and nitrogen) are heated (i.e. an external thermal field
is introduced). As a result of interaction, they form a molecule of water. But
if a single atom is withdrawn from the molecule, the water will disappear...Can
we treat the right-hand triangle of this technical reaction, in Figure 6.0,
formula as a ‘molecule’ of technical system (TS)? Let us validate this idea:
will the system work if we withdraw any of the substances? No, the system will
fall apart and cease to be a system. The same holds true for the situation in
which the field is withdrawn. Does this mean that the system’s operation is
secured by the presence of all three of the elements? Yes. This follows from the
main principle of materialism: a substance can only be modified by material
factors, i.e. by matter or energy (a field). With respect to a TS, this
principle is as follows: a substance can only be modified as a result of a
direct action performed by another substance (for example, impact - mechanical
field) or by field action of another substance (for example, magnetic) or by an
external field. As a consequence, the minimal number of elements any TS consists
of is three: two substances and a field. The concept of minimal TS was named <i>
<b>substance-field system</b></i>, or<i><b> Su-Field</b></i> (from ‘substance’
and ‘field’, see Figure 7.0).</p>

<p align="left">RULES FOR THE INVENTOR: Su-FIELD SYNTHESIS</p>
</font><font SIZE="2">
</font>
<p>Discarding redundancies, Su-Field models shed light on the essence of
transformations (synthesis and evolution) of technical systems and allow the use
universal technical language to represent the process of solving any inventive
problem. That is why analysis of substance-field structures in those parts of
technical systems where contradictions occur under transformation is called
Su-Field analysis<b>. </b>Su-Field analysis presents a general formula that
shows the direction of solving the problem. This direction depends heavily on
the initial conditions of the problem. Consider the example problem: any
slightest alteration of conditions will profoundly change the process of solving
the problem. For example, no materials may be introduced into the match head, no
cooling medium can be poured into the hollow boom of the robot, etc. How can you
decide then, which step to take?</p>
<p>There are several rules of Su-Field synthesis. Several rules will be
presented in this paper (certainly only a small subset). One of them is
described in Figure 8.0:</p>

        easy to change as required, and the conditions do not contain any
        limitations on the introduction of substances and fields, the problem is
        to be solved by synthesizing a Su-Field model: the object is subjected
        to the action of a physical field that produces the necessary change in
        the object. The missing elements are introduced accordingly.<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p align="left">

<p>Quite often, conditions contain two substances and a field that have
insufficient interaction and cannot be replaced with other substances or field.
That is, the SFM is there (all the three elements are present) and, at the same
time, it is not there: it simply won’t work. The same may happen after
completing a SFM. That means that the SFM needs to be improved: the substances
should become controllable, the field should have a desired effect, and the
character of interaction of elements should proceed as required. There is a set
of transformation rules for substances and fields in Su-Field models, see

<p align="left"></p>
</font><b>
<p>GROUP 4-1: INSTEAD OF MEASUREMENT AND DETECTION - SYSTEM CHANGE</p>
<p>STANDARD 4-1-1.</b> If we are given the problem of detection or measurement,
it is proposed to change it such that there should be no need to perform
detection or measurement at all.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>Example. To prevent a permanent electric motor from overheating, its’
    temperature is measured by a temperature sensor. If the poles of the motor
    are made from an alloy with a Curie point equal to the critical value of the
    temperature, the motor will stop itself.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</i><b>
<p>STANDARD 4-1-2.</b> If we are given the problem of detection or measurement
and it is impossible to change the problem to remove the need for detection or
measurement, it is proposed to replace direct operations on the object with
operations on its copy or picture.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>Example. It might be dangerous to measure the length of a snake. It is
    safe to measure its length on a photographic image of the snake, and then
    recalculate the obtained result.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</i><b>
<p>STANDARD 4-1-3.</b> If we are given the problem of measurement and the
problem cannot be changed to remove the need for measurement, and it is
impossible to use copies or pictures, it is proposed to transform this problem
into the a problem of successive detection of changes.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>NOTE: Any measurement is carried out with a certain degree of accuracy.
    Therefore, even if the problem deals with continuous measurement, one can
    always single out a simple act of measurement involving two successive
    detections. This makes the problem considerably simpler.</p>
    <i>
    <p>Example. To measure a temperature, it is possible to use a material that
    changes its color depending on the current value of the temperature.
    Alternatively, several materials can be used to indicate different
    temperatures.</p>
    </i><b>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>GROUP 4-2: SYNTHESIS OF MEASUREMENT SYSTEM</p>
<p>STANDARD 4-2-1.</b> If a non-SFM is not easy to detect or measure, the
problem is solved by synthesizing a simple or dual SFM with a field at the
output. Instead of direct measurement or detection of a parameter, another
parameter identified with the field is measured or detected.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="01d.gif" width="340" height="111"></p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>Example: To detect a moment when a liquid starts to boil, an electrical
    current is passed through the liquid. During boiling, air bubbles are formed
    - they dramatically reduce electrical resistance of the liquid.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</i><b>
<p>STANDARD 4-2-2.</b> If a system (or its part) does not provide detection or
measurement, the problem is solved by transition to an internal or external
complex measuring SFM, introducing easily detectable additives.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="01e.gif" width="348" height="73"></p>
<i>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>Example. To detect leakage in a refrigerator, a cooling agent is mixed
    with a luminophore powder. </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</i><b>
<p>STANDARD 4-2-3.</b> If a system is difficult to detect or to measure at a
given moment of time, and it is impossible to introduce additives in the object,
then additives that create an easily detectable and measured field should be
introduced in the external environment and changing state of the environment
will provide an indication of the state of the object.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>Example. To detect wearing of a rotating metal disc contacting with
    another disk, it is proposed to introduce luminophore into the oil
    lubricant, which already exists in the system. Metal particles collecting in
    the oil will reduce luminosity of the oil.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</i><b>
<p>STANDARD 4-2-4.</b> If it is impossible to introduce easily detectable
additives in the external environment, these can be obtained in the environment
itself, e. g. by decomposing it or by changing the aggregate state of the
environment.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>NOTE: Specifically, gas or vapor bubbles produced by electrolysis,
    cavitation or by any other method are often used as additives obtained by
    decomposing the external environment.</p>
    <i>
    <p>Example. The speed of a water flow in a pipe might be measured by amount
    of air bubbles resulting from cavitation.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</i><b>
<p>GROUP 4-3: ENHANCEMENT OF MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>STANDARD 4-3-1.</b> Efficiency of a measuring SFM is enhanced by the use of
physical effects.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>Example. Temperature of liquid media can be measured by measuring a
    change of a coefficient of retraction which depends on the value of the
    temperature.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</i><b>
<p>STANDARD 4-3-2.</b> If it is impossible to detect or measure directly the
changes that take place, and if no field can be passed through the system, the
problem is to be solved by exciting resonance oscillations (of the whole system
or of its part), whose frequency change is an indication of the changes that
take place.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>Example. To measure the mass of a substance in a container, the container
    is subjected to mechanically forced resonance oscillations. The frequency of
    the oscillations depends on the mass of the system.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</i><b>
<p>STANDARD 4-3-3.</b> If no resonance oscillations can be excited in a system,
its state can be determined by a change in the natural frequency of the object
(external environment) connected with the system under control.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>Example. The mass of boiling liquid can be measured by measuring the
    natural frequency of gas resulting from evaporation.</p>
    </i><b>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>GROUP 4-4: TRANSITION TO FERROMAGNETIC MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>STANDARD 4-4-1.</b> Efficiency of a measuring SFM is enhanced by using a
ferromagnetic substance and a magnetic field.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>NOTE: The standard indicates the use of a ferromagnetic substance that is
    not crushed. </p>
    <i>
    <p>Example. A group of students from the North Carolina Agricultural and
    Technical State University (NCAT) developed a method of measuring speed,
    direction, time, and operating status of an operating system designed to
    unwind some type of material from one spool to another spool (Spring 2000
    Multidisciplinary Design Project). In order to take mechanical rotations and
    put them in the form of analog pulses that could be analyzed by either a
    microprocessor or electronic component through a pulsed tachometer the
    following detection method was developed. A pulsed tachometer can detect
    rotations of a rotating shaft that contain a ferromagnetic rotor comprised
    of iron brushes perpendicular to the axis. The magnet in the pickup sensor
    creates a magnetic field around the sensor. When the &quot;iron brushes&quot; on the
    rotor pass through the magnetic field the flux change induces an EMF in a
    coil sensor. These create analog pulses that can be used to determine
    operating speed, time, direction, and status.</p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>
<b>
<p>STANDARD 4-4-2.</b> Efficiency of detection or measurement is enhanced by
transition to ferromagnetic SFM's, replacing one of the substances with
ferromagnetic particles (or adding ferromagnetic particles), and by detecting or
measuring the magnetic field.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>Example. In an effort to orient or align numerous objects, ferromagnetic
    material can be added to the same portion of each object to be aligned. A
    magnet can then be used to attract the ferromagnetic portion of the object
    thus orienting or aligning the objects. </p>

<p>STANDARD 4-4-3.</b> If it is required to raise a system's efficiency of
detection or measurement by going over to a ferromagnetic SFM, while replacement
of the substance with ferromagnetic particles is not allowed, the transition to
the feSFM is performed by building a complex ferromagnetic SFM, introducing (or
attaching) ferromagnetic additives in the substance.</p>

    <p>Example. The addition of iron oxide (a ferromagnetic powder) is now
    included as a pigment in black ink to validate currency and other negotiable
    documents. This technology is in continual development as computers and high
    quality color printers make counterfeiting an elementary process. The
    magnetic fields from these particles produce signatures that, when read by
    magnetic sensors, can also be used to determine denominations of currency by
    vending or change machines.</p>

    <p>Example. The discovery of the electron resulted in extreme advances in
    the chemistry field. In 1927 Wolfgang Pauli developed a formal
    representation of the electron spin concept. Experimentation in 1967
    produced data that indicated that electrons from ferromagnetic particles
    (Fe, Co, and Ni) were not spin polarized as had been previously theorized.
    To continue testing a ultrahigh vacuum was constructed where photoemissions
    of electrons could be performed down to 4.2K and in magnetic fields up to
    50kOe. This device obtained strikingly different results: the electrons
    photemitted from various particles were highly spin polarized. Continued
    research allowed for the development of spin polarization spectroscopy
    helping scientists to further understand magnetism. Recent testing utilizing
    thin ferromagnetic films indicates that the films may be useful in acting as
    a spin filter similar to plastic foils used with polarized light. </p>

    <i>
    <p>Example. Diagnosing and forecasting residual life of steel structures is
    important in determining the safety of large structures. Material magnetic
    memory (MMM) is effective in the assessment of stressed-strained state of
    structures. This method envelopes the theory that in zones of stress and
    strain concentration there are irreversible changes of the magnetic state of
    ferromagnetic items. Change of residual magnetization in tension,
    compression, torsion, and cyclic loading of ferromagnetic items is directly
    related to the maximal acting stress. The operator moves a sensor measuring
    the residual magnetic field intensity (Hp, A/m), along the weld over the
    entire perimeter and then transversely to the weld with the amplitude of
    deviation from the weld edge for 30 to 50 mm towards the base metal of the
    pipe element. The second operator records in the log book the data on
    residual magnetization of the metal, namely magnetic field intensity with
    the plus or minus sign. An abrupt change of the sign and value of Hp points
    to a concentration of residual stresses along Hp=0 line for a specific
    section of the welded joint. The main purpose of MMM is detection of the
    most critical sections and components in the controlled plant, which are
    characterized by SC zones. After MMM, the traditional methods of
    non-destructive testing (UT, X-ray, and eddy current inspection, etc.) are
    used to determine the presence of a particular defect. </p>

<p>STANDARD 4-5-1.</b> Efficiency of a measuring system at any stage of its
development is enhanced by transitioning to a measuring bi- or poly-system.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>NOTE: For a simple formation of bi- and poly-systems two or more elements
    are to be combined. The elements to be combined may be substances, fields,
    substance-field pairs and whole SFM's.</p>
    <i>
    <p>Example. It is difficult to accurately measure the temperature of a small
    beetle. However, if there are many beetles put together, the temperature can
    be measured easily.</p>

<p>STANDARD 4-5-2.</b> Measuring systems are developed towards a transition to
measuring the derivatives of the function under control. The transition is
performed along the following line:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>measurement of a function ---&gt;</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>measurement of the first derivative of the function ---&gt;</p>
    <blockquote>
  <p>measurement of the second derivative of the function.</p>

    <p align="left">CONCLUSION</p>
    </font>
    <p>Substance-field analysis has been shown to allow the creation of a model
    that is representative of the system under discussion. Several
    transformation rules have been presented as well as supportive examples. The
    76 standard solutions have been presented as has an elucidation of the class
    of solutions dedicated to the resolution of problems associated with
    measuring and detecting (Class 4). The application of these principles is
    extremely powerful in defeating psychological inertia and increasing the
    innovative level of the solution (increasing the level of ideality as well).
