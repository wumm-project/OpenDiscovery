<p>Research work is being undertaken at the Center for Innovation and Product
Design at the Monterrey Institute of Technology (Mexico), looking for the
integration of different design tools and methodologies to increase product
design effectiveness and productivity.</p>
<p>This paper describes the integration of TRIZ and �Classical� Design
Methodologies as Morphological Matrix during the design process at the
conceptual and at the embodiment design stage. As TRIZ is not originally a tool
that belongs to the �classical� product design methodologies, its place in the
product design process has to be identified in order to increase its
effectiveness. The proposed approach has been tested and improved during several
years at the course Product Analysis and Design (M99-235) of the Master Program
in Manufacturing Engineering at ITESM Campus Monterrey. The course is based on
the strategy of Project Oriented Learning, focused on enhancing creativity and
inventive skills of the students and its ability to create virtual 3D-Parametric
CAD models of the products being designed. Students work in teams solving real
world product design projects from Mexican manufacturing enterprises on a
contractual basis. This allows the evaluation of the used approach from the
point of view of its usefulness for solving real world product design problems
as also from the point of view of its friendliness for learning and use.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Introduction</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p>The product development process may be defined as the complex system of
activities that produces the information required for bringing products to
manufacture that is derived from market opportunities. Further more it is known
that the design process is an information generating process, which starts with
an abstract and often uncertain and confuse description of a new or enhanced
product performance and ends with the documentation for manufacturing the
desired product. Efficiently and effectively supporting the design process with
computational tools and methods is limited due to its lack of integration.</p>
<p>Research work is being undertaken at the Center for Innovation and Product
Design at the Monterrey Institute of Technology (Mexico), looking for the
integration of different design tools and methodologies to increase design
effectiveness and productivity.</p>
<p>First results about our approach of an integrated model of the Conceptual
Design Process were presented at the QFD Symposium [1] and TRIZCON�99 [2]. In
both papers the integration of QFD and TRIZ in the product design process was
presented based on case studies. Further theoretic reflections about the
integration of TRIZ and CAD were presented at TRIZCON�2001 [3].</p>
<p>This approach is intended to contribute to a reduction in product development
time and to an improvement in quality and performance by creating the groundwork
for integrating product development tools and methods.</p>
<p>Furthermore it is intended to have an approach of the design process that may
be easily learned due to its logical structure and to the enhanced capability of
students/designers for achieving better solutions for challenging design
projects.</p>
</font><font size="2"><b>
<p>2. M-99-235 and THE qtc approach</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p>The present approach is based on the integration of parametric analysis [4]
and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) during the specification/planning stage;
the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) [5] and �Classical� Design
Methodologies as Morphological Matrix at the conceptual design stage [6], [7]
and 3D-parametric computer aided design tools at the embodiment design stage.
The approach is named <b>QTC</b>, because of the integrated use of <b>Q</b>FD,
<b>T</b>RIZ and <b>C</b>AD.</p>
<p>QTC has been tested and improved during several years at the course Product
Analysis and Design (M99-235) of the Master Program in Manufacturing
Engineering. The course is based on the strategy of Project Oriented Learning
and is focused on enhancing creativity and inventive skills of the students and
their ability to create virtual 3D-Parametric CAD models of the products.
Students work in teams solving real world product design projects from Mexican
manufacturing enterprises on a contractual basis. The enterprises assign
experienced representatives to follow up the projects and to provide the
students with the needed background and existing information.</p>
<p>One of the requisites for choosing a project for the course is that it should
contain a reasonable challenge and it should be estimated as possible to fulfill
during an academic semester. In cases when the challenge or volume of work may
be too big, it is possible to divide the content in two or more students� teams.
</p>
<p>Actually it is not possible to rigorously evaluate the results from the point
of view of its designed performance, as it is not feasible to have the same
products designed through alternative or classical approaches. However the
achieved solutions can be evaluated from the point of view of the acceptance of
the enterprise representatives. Furthermore the approach is evaluated from the
point of view of its acceptance and ease for being learned by the students.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Students learn and apply the referred tools in their design
projects in four modules: specification/planning, conceptual design, embodiment
design and design for manufacturing. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Fig. 1 a diagram of the conceptual map that supports this
approach is shown.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following is a briefly description of the activities
accomplished during the first two course modules and its relationships to the
conceptual map.</p>

</font><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1. Specification/planning</p>
</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the first module Parametric Analysis followed by QFD
are applied as main tools of the specification/planning stage. Although both
tools are applied mainly during the first module, students are encouraged to
extend its use through the whole recurrent product development process, as shown
in Fig 1, pursuing the objective to further improve their insight into the
products being developed. This appeal is based on the judgment that due to the
huge amount of time and work needed to execute a parametric product analysis and
the QFD process, both tools may not be accomplished as a simple stage of the
project schedule of a product design but rather have to be continuously
performed as part of the enterprises� culture in order to gain a competitive
advantage in the market. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, executed as an academic exercise during the first
module of the course, the combination of both tools allows students to gain a
deep insight into the products being developed.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Students are encouraged to use the INTERNET with advanced
search engines to gather information of similar products that may be considered
competitors. Commonly students perform this assignment in 2 weeks, during which
they gather parametric and graphic information that is then resumed in tables
and graphics showing the correlations of important product parameters or
indicators.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In table 1 an example is shown of gathered information about
can vending machines.</p>
</font><b>
<p align="left">Table 1: Parametric Analysis Vending Machines (extract)</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="02a.gif" width="700" height="409"></p>
</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p>In Fig. 2 is shown a parametric correlation of two selected parameters of
vending machines. The selected parameters are the whole machine volume and its
capacity, measured as the total number of cans that the </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">machine is able to contain.</p>
<p>Each point in this graphic represents one of the vending machines
encountered. The parametric analysis performed was to find the ellipse�s axis
ratio that includes the most representative of the 62 machines registered (in
this case p= 0.85) and the regression coefficient of the line that better
follows the pattern of points (in this case R<sup>2= 0.376</sup>). </p>
<p>In each case students/designers have to choice and decide which parameters
should be graphically represented in order to recognize trends and important
relationships among the product parameters. </p>
<p>Based on these graphics, specification/planning decisions may be supported.
One recommended exercise is to draw a line that connects the parameter values of
the existing product with the recommended values for the new product being
developed and to compare this line with the general pattern identified for the
bunch of products analyzed. </p>
<p>The notion of innovation and technical contradiction of TRIZ may be perceived
at this point if the proposed relative change of the parameters for the new
product follows the identified pattern or not.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of QFD was described in [1] and [2] as to identify the
most important issues and parameters of the products and to link priorities and
target values back to the customer <u><b>before</b></u></font>
<font FACE="Times New Roman">the new product design process is started. </p>
<p>After that one of the features of the HOQ diagram requires to define the
directions in which product parameters has to change, or which parameters should
remain unchanged for a better customer satisfaction. Identifying relationships
among the parameters at the roof of the HOQ helps in identifying technical
contradictions and innovations requirements stated. The use of TRIZ at the
conceptual design stage may then focus on <u><b>how</b></u> to achieve these
changes to gain bigger market shares. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This combined use of parametric analysis and QFD allows
gaining a better understanding of the market and customer needs and of its
relationships to the existing product structure and parameters. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
</font><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.2. Conceptual Design</p>
</b><font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Morphology is the science of relationships between ideas and
actions, founded and developed by Swiss (American) astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky
[7]. The resulting technique of creativity aims to replace subconscious mind
driven and therefore arbitrary, random production of ideas by a conscious,
systematic approach.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Functional decomposition is the analysis of the activity of a
system as the product of a set of subordinate functions performed by independent
subsystems, each with its own characteristic domain of application. It assumes
that there are a variety of functionally independent units, with intrinsically
determined functions, that are minimally interactive.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Students start the conceptual design module from the now as
�classical� recognized method of Zwicky�s morphological matrix [8] as proposed
in several Engineering Design Books [6] and [7]; combined with the functional
decomposition of the design object. The functional decomposition helps in
gaining a better understanding of the product.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The generation of ideas for the different items of a design
object through the combined use of Functional Decomposition and Morphological
Matrix is a proved useful method in product design as it stimulates creativity
and helps to find new unexpected solutions through new combinations of solutions
at the lower functional levels.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This method may be considered a kind of �structured�
brainstorming, as the ideas generation for the different functions occurs more
or less spontaneously. Not always the ideas generated during a Morphological
Matrix session are able to solve the technical contradictions inherently in the
problems.</p>
<p>Synectic is a method commonly used in Germany to improve the ideas generation
after a morphological matrix session. Author of the method Synectic is William
J. J. Gordon [9]. He developed this method in 1944 on the basis of intense
studies about mental and problem solution processes. This heuristic principle
&lt;http://translate.copernic.com:8090/gz_heuristik.html?AlisTargetHost=http://www.grauezelle.de&amp;AlisFramesTgtDoc&amp;AlisUILang=en&amp;AlisUI=frames_ex/gen_toolbar&amp;AlisTargetLang=en&gt;
is based on the reorganization of different knowledge to new patterns. </p>
<p>The synectic method is based on the principle of the systematic confrontation
by analogies. The method acknowledges that original ideas often appear not from
a conscious problem treatment, but as a reaction to the confrontation with
elements strange to the problem (events, structures, etc). So, e.g., Newton
should become clear of the gravitation principle while observing falling an
apple. This natural creative process is tried to be imitated with the methods of
the creative confrontation.</p>
<p>Although the synectic method has also proved to be useful to enhance the
results obtained after a morphological matrix session, its use is difficult and
it not always provides innovative results. Therefore the use of TRIZ combined
with the morphological matrix is tried as an alternative method.</p>
<p>TRIZ has proved to be a very strong tool in helping to solve difficult
technical problems that requires inventive thinking; that means problems where
one or more technical contradictions are involved and which do not have known
ways or means of solution [10], [11]. However the use of TRIZ in the product
design process has yet to be better identified and established.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Students are introduced to TRIZ during the second course
module and are asked to use it combined with the morphological matrix to enhance
its results. Although commonly acceptable solutions appear since the first trial
with the morphological matrix, students are asked to not stop at that level of
solutions and to go further with TRIZ to increase their capability of developing
more creative and innovative solutions.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concept of Ideal Final Result has shown to be a universal
and robust way to lead to better solutions, as psychological inertia and
creativity inhibitions are eliminated.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Students are asked to first clarify the concept of Ideal
Final Result in relation to their projects and then use the Altshuller�s
Contradiction Matrix applying it to the strong conflicts (#) identified at the
roof of the House of Quality. This task is aimed to help them gaining a better
understanding of the concept of technical contradictions. As the probability of
obtaining a suitable inventive principle through the use of the Contradiction
Matrix is rather low, students are encouraged to scan the 40 inventive
principles looking for those more likely to be applied to their specific
problems. They are also asked to work on converting the technical contradictions
in physical contradictions and to try to solve the problems based on this
conversion.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Students are also introduced to the use of TRIZ software as
IWB and TechOptimizer [12] and are encouraged to apply these tools to search for
better innovative solutions. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a measure of the improvements obtained, students are asked
to make a comparative presentation of results obtained before and after applying
TRIZ tools and methods.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commonly students recognize important improvements achieved
which increase the quality and technical level of the solutions obtained. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Students are also asked to identify how comfortable they feel
using this approach. Their response is generally enthusiastic or at least
positive. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of the conceptual design stage Pugh concept
selection is applied to choice solutions among the variants developed with the
Morphological Matrix and enhanced with TRIZ. One handicap related to the
Morphologic Matrix approach, lies in not having yet certain ways for identifying
possible incompatibilities among the different combinations of the partial
functions; as also in not possessing confident enough evaluation methods for
selecting the best solutions among the huge numbers of possible combinations
that may be obtained. In Table 2 (see attachment) an example is shown of the
morphological matrix for the development of a fuel-water separating device. The
additional ideas generated with TRIZ tools are in gray shaded cells with bold
letters.</p>
</font><font size="2"><b>
<p>3. Conclusions</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p>Students and research assistants participating in these projects agree that
the combined and systematic use of these tools facilitated their design tasks
and helped them in finding better solutions.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prevalently students show enthusiasm in applying TRIZ tools
and methods combined with the morphological matrix and declare to feel
comfortable in using both methods in a combined way. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When asked which characteristic they perceive better in this
approach they generally declare that the morphological matrix helps them to
organize the conceptual design tasks while TRIZ methods and tools help to gain a
deeper insight in the problematic and to gain confidence in the proposed
solutions which are generally more innovative and technically better.</p>
<p>More than 50 case studies have been developed in the last 5 years, which
ranges from consumer products as home appliances up to subassemblies of
industrial machines. The acceptance of the results by the enterprise
representatives is prevalently enthusiastic although it depends of the degree of
involvement that they perform during the project.</p>
