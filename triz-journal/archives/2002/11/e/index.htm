<p>Abstract: The seven evaluation criteria of solutions are considered using a
new locking device for gates as an example. The evaluation is compared with the
results of experiments. </p>
<p>&quot;How in the hell nobody has thought of this earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>These are often the first comments of the new locking mechanism for gates and
hatches, invented by Mauno Lahtinen, an entrepreneur in machine building, and
Paavo Holtt�, an economist. </p>
<p>The story began from a great disaster. The passenger vessel ESTONIA capsized
on 28 September 1994 in the Baltic Sea. Total 852 lives were lost. </p>
<p>The failure of the bow visor caused the disaster. A bow visor is a gate in
the head of a ferry. It reminds the visor in the helmet of a motorcyclist.</p>
<font size="2"><b>
<p>The Incredibly Simple Invention</p>
</b></font>
<p>The Investigation Commission concluded that the locking devices in the gates
should have been several times stronger [1 ]. Lahtinen and H�ltt� went further.
They proposed additionally a more reliable locking mechanism.</p>
<p>The locking mechanism includes a female part, a male part, and a pin securing
the two parts.</p>
<p>In the old construction the locking pin is a cylinder. The cylindrical form
compels to make a clearance between the pin and other parts, to ensure that the
gate can be closed and opened. The construction is not rigid. The parts can
move, wear each another, and ultimately fracture. </p>
<p>The idea of the invention is simple: A conical pin is used instead of
cylindrical one. For more details see &quot;Simpified TRIZ&quot; [2] and the patent
description [3]. Actually, the old principle of the wedge is used in the new
place. </p>
<p>Now parts form a rigid construction in every direction. An expert in the
strength of metal materials Kari Immonen helped to calculate the proper angle of
the cone. It was 15.4 degrees. That angle ensures that the parts are tightly
locked and easily unlocked. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Evaluation by the Criteria of the Final Ideal Result</p>
</b></font>
<p>The theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) allows to give reliable
criteria for the evaluation of ideas. They are based on the study of a large
number of successful solutions. Let's apply seven criteria presented in
&quot;Simplified TRIZ&quot; [2]:</p>
<p>1. Do the harmful features disappear?</p>
<p>Yes. There will be no wear, since the parts are tightly locked.</p>
<p>2. Are the useful features retained?</p>
<p>Will new benefits appear?</p>
<p>Yes. Simplicity is retained. The locking problem is solved.</p>
<p>3. Will new harmful features appear?</p>
<p>No. There are no new harmful features.</p>
<p>4. Does the system become more complex?</p>
<p>No. Actually it gets simpler.</p>
<p>5. Is the inherent, most important contradiction resolved?</p>
<p>Yes. There was a clear primary contradiction in the old construction. The pin
should be tight or have no clearance and at the same time it should be loose or
have a big clearance. The conical pin has no clearance when closed, and a big
clearance is formed as the locking begins open.</p>
<p>6. Are idle, easily available, earlier ignored resources used?</p>
<p>Yes. The geometry of the pin is an idle resource used. </p>
<p>7. Are possible other criteria fulfilled?</p>
<p>Yes. Since only small changes are needed, a new mechanism fits well to the
ship or ferry as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font size="2"><b>
<p>What did the experiments show?</p>
</b></font>
<p>The seven criteria allow to evaluate ideas before experiments and help to
decide whether they are worth to be tested. </p>
<p>Let's now see the results of the experiments in the laboratory and the sea.
</p>
<p>The device for a big ferry with real-life dimensions was tested in the
Laboratory of strength of materials in Helsinki University of Technology,
according the rules of the register (insurance) company Norske Veritas. The
dynamic load to 200 kN was tested 100 000 times. No problems appeared. The
results of the static load testing were also good. The static strength was in
practice five times better than in the theoretical calculation, obviously thanks
to the tight construction.</p>
<p>For the experiments on the sea the smaller device was installed in a small
ferry. It was opened and closed 20 000 times. The number of openings and
closings is approximately the same as during the lifetime of a big ferry. The
construction worked excellently. An additional benefit was found: the new
construction was actually noiseless. It is also worth to mention that there were
no problems with thermal expansion in spite of tight construction.</p>
<p>During the experiments appeared small problems that were solved. The cylinder
was strengthened. </p>
<p>An auxiliary device that locks the same locking device was designed. </p>
<p>Now the inventors and related companies are planning more thorough
experiments with a large scale device. </p>
<p>To avoid the oversimplification one must say that there will be inevitably
secondary problems that cannot be seen beforehand. The criteria of TRIZ say that
the core idea is good and the problems in the implementation can be solved, and
it is reasonable to invest in the invention.</p>
<p>An experienced naval architect Tuomo Karppinen who now works as the director
of the Finnish center for accident investigations, has put it precisely: &quot;It is
a good basic construction that deserves to be elaborated further.&quot; </p>
