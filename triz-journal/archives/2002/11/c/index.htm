    </b>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public education in the U.S. is now facing increasing
    competition from private educational initiatives especially in the virtual
    domain. In Pennsylvania public education is partially funded by the State,
    based upon student enrollment and attendance. The increasing numbers of two
    groups of students, those who are homebound and those who are homeschooled,
    are adversely affecting the monetary resources available to districts.
    Homebound students fall into two subsets. The larger is composed of students
    who have been expelled for disciplinary reasons or inappropriate social
    behavior and are not permitted to be in school. Districts must provide them
    with a free education until the age of 17. The second subset consists of
    students that are homebound due to medical reasons. Districts find educating
    homebound students to be inordinately expensive. The home-schooled group
    consists of students whose parents are instructing their students at home.
    School districts do not receive state aid for home-schooled students. These
    students are being attracted in large numbers to cyber charter schools that
    provide educational curricula on the Internet. For each enrolled student,
    the school district must pay the cyber charter school approximately 75-80%
    of the home district�s per pupil cost of educating a student or lose a
    portion of its state funding because the State mandates that districts
    subsidize the cyber charter schools for the expenses of educating these
    students.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A group of 20 doctoral students in educational leadership
    at East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania were introduced to TRIZ and
    the use of a new Contradiction Matrix for Business and Management. These
    students together with the authors have rewritten the 31 features of the
    matrix<font COLOR="#0000ff"> </font>in the language of educators in order to
    modify this matrix to create a version appropriate for educational problems.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The doctoral students have addressed some technical
    contradictions (trade-offs) associated with home-schooled students, in
    particular the homebound population of students expelled from the public
    school system for severe behavioral problems, such as drug use or carrying
    weapons.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This paper will report the 31 features written in
    educational terms and their relationships to the business and management
    features. This paper will also discuss potential solution concepts generated
    by the doctoral students in education, using the Contradiction Matrix for
    Business and Management modified to be used to resolve education related
    technical conflicts including an extension of the cyber school concept for a
    second student population.</p>
  <b>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.0 General Introduction</p>
    </b>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A wide array of public and private alternatives now
    exists for families with school-aged children. In the private domain options
    include traditional independent residential and day schools, institutions
    supported by religious groups, and a recent addition, private cyber charter
    schools that use e-learning as the instructional delivery model. Some states
    and regions support parental choice by providing taxpayer-generated stipends
    called vouchers that can be utilized to underwrite all or a portion of the
    tuition. A second category of alternatives, which falls under the public
    domain, includes magnet schools, that have a specifically designed mission,
    such as the arts or technology, and charter schools that are funded by
    taxpayer generated monies, free from most state mandates, and meant to be
    tuition free. A new version of the charter school, the cyber charter school,
    has surfaced recently and allows students to receive their education while
    at home delivered through the internet from a site that might be miles away
    and not in anyway associated with the district.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">School districts across Pennsylvania are
    <font FACE="Times">seeking technology-</font>enhanced solutions to various
    educational challenges. For example, in the 2001-2002 school year, Monroe
    County school districts spent over $200,000 to ensure barely adequate
    training for their �homebound� students. Based upon projections, these
    numbers will drastically increase in coming years. A second group of
    students, the homeschooled, for example, drain funds from the districts when
    they enroll in cyber charter schools, as most of the funds allocation per
    student travels to the charter school. A second problem is the need to
    enhance the educational training experience for all students by offering
    web-based learning alternatives for students within the Commonwealth.
    Ultimately, district owned and operated cyber-schools would ensure
    educational excellence for all students receiving cyber education, while
    returning funds and resources to local districts to be used by all students.
    This paper reports the work of the authors, and Dr. Faith Waters' graduate
    studies class of twenty doctoral students. The paper includes �educational
    equivalents� for the 31 features of a Contradiction Matrix for Business and
    Management developed by Mann (1), and results for resolving contradictions
    associated with �homebound� students using the Contradiction Matrix for
    Business and Management. </p>
  <b>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.0 Students Who Are Taught at Home</p>
    </b>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homebound students fall into several populations or
    categories. Home-schooled students represent an important class. These are
    students whose parents have made the decision to keep them out of the public
    school system. The parents are required to provide an education consistent
    with the public school standards and curricula. The parents are making a
    tradeoff between the quality of education and exposing their children to an
    environment that does not meet their expectations for respect for authority,
    religious curricula, moral issues such as sex, drugs, and inappropriate
    behavior, and the safety of their children. The parents of students want
    control of the environment, and the schools want control over a consistent
    curriculum. Another class of homebound students is those who are confined to
    their homes for medical reasons. These students may have short or long term
    schooling at home. </p>
  <b>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A final class of homebound students is students who have
    been expelled from the public school system due to severe behavior problems.
    This paper addresses this class of homebound student specifically. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.0 Ideal Final Result</p>
    </b>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An ideal solution is that all schools will be able to
    meet the needs of all students. This includes the general student population
    as well as the homebound population.</p>
  <b>
    <font FACE="Times">
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.0 </font>Methods</p>
    </b>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr. Faith Waters, Department Chair, Professional and
    Secondary Education, and a group of twenty doctoral students were introduced
    to TRIZ and the use of TRIZ principles to find a solution to the problems
    associated with homebound students. In particular, the group focused on the
    population of homebound students who had been expelled from the public
    schools. The group decided to use the Contradiction Matrix for Business and
    Management developed by Darrell Mann and reported at TRIZCon 2002, the 4<sup>th</sup>

    Annual Conference of the Altshuller Institute for TRIZ Studies, in St.
    Louis, April 30 - May 2, 2002. (1) The group was also encouraged to
    concentrate on the ideal final result and the optimal use of resources.</p>
<p>The Contradiction Matrix for Business and Management contains 31 parameters.
A portion of this matrix is reproduced in Table 1 below. The new Matrix is
intended to function in much the same way as the classical Matrix; the user is
encouraged to think about what they are trying to improve and then what is
stopping them from making the improvement. The win-win matrix contains 31
business features. The win-win matrix is symmetrical, that is, the trade-offs
between any two features do not depend on which is improving or worsening.</p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.0 Results and Discussions</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.1 Educational Equivalents for the Business Features </p>
  </b>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The team immediately recognized the need to identify some
    �educational equivalents� to the parameters developed for business
    applications. The team decided to create equivalents for Kindergarten
    through 12th grade and an additional set of equivalents for higher education
    (Colleges and Universities). These equivalents are reported below in the
    tables 2 and 3. Table 2 suggests educational equivalents for the 31 features
    of the Contradiction Matrix for Business and Management for public education
    grades K-12. For example, feature number 16 is labeled Product Reliability
    (or Support Specification, Support Quality, and Support Means) for business
    and management. The K-12 educational equivalents are Remediation, Quality of
    Education, Quality of Supervision, and Student Test Scores.</p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.2 Contradictions Associated with the Expelled Homebound
    Student</p>

  </b>

    <p>We considered some of the contradictions inherent to the problem of the
    homebound students who were expelled from the traditional public school
    environment for behavior or discipline reasons. These students receive the
    least adequate schooling and are the largest financial drain on the school
    districts. On the other hand, their parents are the least resistant to
    changes to their children�s programming, as they feel a need to be compliant
    based on the expulsion dilemma and desiring favorable consideration for
    future readmittance. Teachers often feel threatened by these students in the
    public school venue. In some districts, teachers refuse to go to the
    homebound students� homes fearing for their safety. The law states that
    these students must be educated, yet no one wants to do it. It is very
    expensive to educate them off-site, and the increasing numbers of expelled
    students are diverting large sums of money from budget-distressed schools.
    These students are often oppositional and need structured support to develop
    morally and emotionally. However, few curricula have been developed to meet
    this need and are rarely if ever included in a homebound program, as the
    limited instructional time is devoted to basic skills. These students
    frequently return to the general student population, but there will be dim
    hope for modification of their previous behavior if there is no consistent
    intervention while they are homebound. These homebound students are assessed
    from time to time to determine progress and ensure compliance. However,
    almost always the teacher or teachers who work with them are not certified
    in the subjects the students must complete. They must then rely on
    worksheets and texts to deliver the content. Several contradictions related
    to this issue are summarized in Table 4 below. </p>

    Staff) and Feature 30, Tension and Stress (State and Federal High Stakes
    Testing, Teacher and Staff Morale, Community Expectations, Societal
    Dysfunctions).</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">School districts attempt to lower costs by cutting
    budgets (thus costs are improving from their point of view.) As stated
    above, special teachers instruct homebound students at home. This requires
    costs associated with the remedial programs, teacher certification, and
    teacher salaries. Without generous salaries and meaningful resources for
    these programs, the teachers� morale is adversely affected because they do
    not want to enter the hostile environments that exist in some of these
    students' homes. Further, they recognize that they are not certified to
    teach most of the subjects and feel insecure about the accuracy of the
    content and the quality of the instructional delivery. Therefore, a
    trade-off exists between costs and tension and stress.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
  <b>
  7.1 First Contradiction </p>
  </b>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the first contradiction, the Contradiction Matrix
    directs us to look at Principles 35 (Parameter Change), 24 (Intermediary),
    10 (Prior Action), and 2 (Take Out). We considered examples from two TRIZ
    Journal articles; namely, �40 Inventive (Business) Principles� ( 2 ) and �40
    Inventive Principles with Social Examples� ( 3 ). Mann, et al., have
    suggested that the same 40 Principles used for technical problem solving,
    may be used for resolution of business problems. The team now proposes that
    these same 40 Principles may be used to resolve contradictions and generate
    solution concepts for educational problems.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For Principle 35 (Parameter Change) Part a., Change an
    object�s physical state (e.g. to a gas, liquid, or solid), the suggestion is
    made to use virtual prototyping. Part b., Change the concentration or
    consistency, suggests changing the team structure. Part c., Change the
    degree of flexibility, suggests software with options for �beginner� to
    �expert� usage. Part d., Change the temperature, suggests getting the
    customer or team fired up or �hot� about the product.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These ideas prompted us to consider a �Virtual
    Educational Component� for every school. The �Virtual Educational Component�
    would utilize the existing teaching staff but in a different way. The
    �Virtual� curricula would support teaching levels from remedial to
    accelerated beginning to expert and the ability to deliver instruction at a
    variety of appropriate levels. The �Virtual Educational Component� would
    provide a high level of educational quality for the homebound students, and
    also eliminate or reduce the tension and stress of teachers having to go to
    the students� homes. The existing teaching staff may be enthusiastic about
    developing the �Virtual Educational Component,� an innovative way to deliver
    instruction, as they perceive it to be a resource support for their
    traditional instruction as well.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Principle 24 (Intermediary) Part a., Use an
    intermediary carrier article or intermediary process, the idea of
    introducing a �Virtual Educational Component� as an interface between the
    teaching staff and the homebound students emerges.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Principle 10 Prior or Preliminary Action, Part a.,
    Perform, before it is needed, the required change of an object (either fully
    or partially), changing the delivery system for learning is consistent with
    the development of a �Virtual� curricula.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For Principle 2 Take Out Part a., Separate an interfering
    part or property from an object, or single out the only necessary part (or
    property) of an object, suggests that it is the educational product that
    needs to be delivered to the homebound student, and this may be done without
    the teacher physically present. Thus the real teacher can be replaced with a
    virtual teacher. This principle also suggests separating the disruption of
    the behavior problems from the learning process.</p>


  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>7.2 Second Contradiction</b></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second contradiction associated with homebound students
  is the tradeoff between a quality education for the homebound students and the
  cost of providing this education. In Table 3, this contradiction is
  represented by Feature 16, Product Reliability or Support Spec/Quality/Means
  (Quality of Education &amp; Supervision; Test Scores) and Feature 12, Supply Costs
  (Salaries; Remediation; Materials; Technology). The contradiction matrix
  directs us to Principles 35 and 24. These have been discussed above.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>7.3 Third Contradiction</b></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third contradiction is the tradeoff between quality of
  education and support costs. These are related to Features 16 and 17. The
  contradiction matrix directs us to consider Principles 2 (Take Out), and 25
  (Self-service). We have discussed Principle 2 above. The Principle 25
  Self-service, Part a., Make an event serve itself by performing auxiliary
  helpful functions, suggests that the customer of the educational system
  (homebound student) could take flexible advantage of the �Virtual Education
  Component� in a manner that is adapted to their own circumstances, learning
  styles, time of day needs, etc. Benefits of asynchronous delivery match the
  needs of this population. The �virtual� curricula may also be developed to
  address the moral and emotional challenges of the homebound student, to
  develop their character while they are learning.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>7.4 Fourth Contradiction</b></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth and final contradiction is the tradeoff between
  quality of education and support time, Features 16 and 18 respectively.
  Feature 16 has been discussed. Feature 18 Support Time has educational
  Equivalents: Filling Unfilled and Understaffed Positions; Professional
  Development; Scheduling. The Contradiction matrix directs us to Principle 22
  (Blessing in Disguise) and Principle 25 (Self-service). The latter has been
  addressed above. Principle 22 Blessing in Disguise, Part b., Eliminate the
  primary harmful action by adding it to another harmful action to resolve the
  problem, suggests eliminating fear of change by introducing fear of
  competition. The establishment of a �Virtual Education Component� to the
  traditional educational system deals effectively with the challenges of the
  homebound student but also threatens and challenges teachers and staff.
  However this may be preferable to the recent challenges of the private cyber
  charter school initiatives in Pennsylvania that represents an even greater
  competitive threat as well as the threat of loss of resources as the budget
  must accommodate increasing costs for homebound students. </p>

<p><b>8.0 General Notes on Application of the Business Matrix</b></p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This paper records some pioneering applications of the new
  Business Contradiction Matrix. Continued efforts should be directed toward
  validating it as a useful addition to the creative process in resolving
  educational issues. This case plus a variety of others taken from a range of
  other industry sectors - from legal, to finance to business model design to
  organization structure re-definition - have highlighted a number of points
  that appear to be applicable generally:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1) Different industries appear to generate very distinct
  terms and expressions to describe different aspects of their business (e.g.
  'teacher release', 'SAT scores' in this paper). No generic set of parameters
  seems capable of mapping even a small proportion of the different terms and
  expressions used. In many senses, this should be viewed as a benefit rather
  than a problem - especially since one of the main aims of the Matrix is to
  facilitate the transfer of 'good' solutions from one sector to others. On the
  other hand, however, users of the Matrix should be able to focus on their
  problem rather than the mechanics of the tool. This is a definition of another
  contradiction; one that, like in other sectors, the team involved in the work
  described here solved by preparing the tables of generic-to-specific
  translations before sitting down to actually use the Matrix in earnest (i.e.
  Inventive Principle 10 - Preliminary Action - was employed).</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2) In the opinion of the authors, technical situations and
  'people' unpredictability are often distinguished by the presence of
  significantly higher degrees of uncertainty in the latter. The Matrix has been
  constructed in a manner that tries to 'manage' this uncertainty. With the
  technical contradiction matrix of classical TRIZ, there is often a debate over
  whether A or B represents the 'right' contradiction to a given problem
  situation. The new Matrix has been constructed in a manner that encourages
  users to examine A and B.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3) The nebulous nature of people-type problem situations
  also makes it likely that solutions will be generated from a wider range of
  Inventive Principles than would be expected in technical situations. It also
  means that there is often considerable benefit in inserting an additional step
  into the 'generate solutions' part of the problem solving process; a step that
  examines the possibilities of combining the solutions derived from the
  different Inventive Principle suggestions. Individual Inventive Principles, in
  other words, offer useful solution generating triggers, but unlike what often
  happens in technical situations, the ultimately best business solutions will
  emerge through combination rather than selection of the ideas generated.</p>
</blockquote>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>9.0 Other Educational Trade-off Examples for Future Work</b></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The doctoral students identified other unresolved, complex
  problems with the following contradictions facing administrators, teachers,
  and staff in Kindergarten through 12th grade levels in public schools in the
  US today. We shall continue to test the ability of the win-win Matrix modified
  with educational equivalents to find solutions for these contradictions.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>9.1 Teacher Release Time</b></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Full time teachers have contractual release time for
  professional development that takes them out of the classroom. In some cases
  as many as twelve to fifteen full-time teachers may be absent at one time.
  Full-time teachers while in the classroom provide excellent quality of
  instruction. Substitute teachers replace full time teachers when they are
  absent; however, the quality of instruction suffers, non-productive,
  repetitive work is the norm, and general chaos often occurs. There is a
  technical contradiction between Teacher Release and Quality of Education. In
  addition, there are associated physical contradictions, the full-time teachers
  must be present and absent, and the substitute teachers are present but should
  be absent.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>9.2 Teachers and Community Morale</b></p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Teacher morale is an issue in �empowered or distressed�
  schools� (Schools whose governance and daily administration has been taken
  over by the State or its designee because of poor test scores). There is
  enormous pressure to manage the district�s financial resources tightly and to
  curb spending in order to stay within the budget.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Teachers and the community complain that it is not possible
  to teach more students with less teacher aid, support, etc. and share concern
  over the investment of significance resources in public relations devoted to
  justifying the takeover process. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>9.3 Standardized Test Scores </b></p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Teachers are expected to improve their classes�
  Pennsylvania State Standardized Assessment (PSSA) scores each year.
  Co-incidentally, societal pressures, such as divorce, child abuse, drug and
  alcohol use, plus new mandates regarding special education, limited English
  proficiency populations and curricular content to be added provide competing
  challenges. This situation results in several technical contradictions;
  namely, Product Quality vs. Communication Flow, Product Quality vs. Support
  Interface, and Product Quality vs. Supply Interface.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>9.4 Time Resources</b></p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Administrators require more time to discuss curricula and
  instructional issues with teachers. Teachers have no time available during
  �contract� hours, and are unwilling to stay overtime. A physical contradiction
  exists, that is, time is needed, but there is no time.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>9.5 Teamwork</b></p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Administrators desire more teamwork between administrators
  and teachers regarding student disciplinary issues. Teachers expect that
  administrators will deal with student behavior problems such as smoking,
  dress-code violations, and inappropriate behavior in hallways, etc. in order
  to allow them to focus on instruction. A technical contradiction between
  Support Interface and Feedback exists.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>9.6 Cyber Charter Schools</b></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">School districts are partially funded by the state based on
  student enrollment and attendance. Home-schooled students do not contribute to
  enrollment or to attendance, and have recently begun receiving state-mandated
  funding from the school districts to attend approved charter schools,
  including cyber-schools, thereby diverting funds from the local school
  districts. Because of this funding process, independent cyber-schools are
  beginning to surface across the state.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of problems arise due to this action. Schools must
  deal with multi-layered communication, and state aid is being diverted from
  the school districts thereby impacting the education of the traditional
  students. The State pays 35% to 50% of Yearly Per Pupil Costs but is
  withholding approximately 75-80% of those funds for homeschooled students. The
  school districts need to cut staff, but cannot cut staff due to contracts, and
  the number of students with severe behavioral problems who are expelled is
  increasing, yet the pool of eager, qualified teachers to work with them is
  decreasing and the funds available to pay for homebound instruction is
  shrinking.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>10.0 Conclusions</b></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The team has endeavored to use TRIZ principles to resolve
  contradictions associated with public school education in the US. In school
  districts in Pennsylvania, homebound students, in particular, students that
  have been expelled from the public school environment, represent significant
  challenges for these budget-distressed school districts.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A solution for resolving four contradictions associated
  with these homebound students has been identified. The introduction of a
  �Virtual Educational Component� in conjunction with the traditional
  educational venues effectively resolves the identified contradictions. In
  addition, the solution also addresses an associated challenge regarding the
  emergence of �cyber charter schools� in Pennsylvania. These schools further
  challenge the already budget distressed school districts.</p>

<p>The TRIZ experience at East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania has
enabled the administration to react quickly to a 2 million dollar grant
opportunity from the United States federal government. East Stroudsburg
University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with Right Reason Technologies have
submitted a proposal for a �Virtual Education Academy - A Cyberschool
Alternative� with the mission of �Assuring Student Achievement so that No
Student is Left Behind.� </p>
