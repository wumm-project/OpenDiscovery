<p>All of us celebrate that Altshuller founded TRIZ and uncovered this
marvellous process for problem solving for the world. Those of us who have now
dedicated our careers to TRIZ can only wonder that the 20- year old Altshuller
could see through the masses of information and detail in new inventions and
patents to see the underlying pattern and theory of invention. TRIZ was
Altshuller�s great gift to the world.</p>
<p>All the powerful and great attract others to them, and both TRIZ and
Altshuller have their followers--help the world, and those who just want TRIZ to
help them and their careers. Almost all the TRIZ community are those who work in
the spirit of Altshuller who work primarily to further the interests of TRIZ
including his own vision that TRIZ should belong to everyone. There is however
the unattractive prospect of those who might slightly distort TRIZ and claim
ownership of the bits they�ve changed. Copyrighted and patented TRIZ type
processes are a sad prospect.</p>
<p>TRIZ is public domain and belongs to us all, perhaps it needs some safe
anchors in the world�s better universities with some serious research and
resources. Bath and Strasbourg in Europe and Wayne State and North Carolina
State Universities in the US are leading the way here but we need more. We also
need to be less afraid of comparing commercial and marketing success and
�TRIZZING� TRIZ by learning from each other�s successes. </p>
<p>The realities are that only a few people can afford to work without earning
money This means that everyone in the TRIZ community, both consultants and
academics, have to be paid for their work, and have to sell their TRIZ work to
industry and others. In today�s economic climate this is tough because TRIZ is
not well known or understood. At Oxford Creativity we like other TRIZ
consultants have many successes and see all sorts of problems solved and TRIZ
becoming embedded in the culture of many companies. We also find the initial
marketing of TRIZ is hard, as what you don�t know about, you distrust and some
people are suspicious of yet another new technique. Many will accept that their
engineers are more innovative and braver after TRIZ training but are nervous of
a process that is initially dependent on TRIZ consultants with no professional
TRIZ standards. There have been some excellent new books recently but the
literature is somewhat confusing to the newcomer.</p>
<p>Life is not supposed to be easy�. The barriers to entry of TRIZ are high and
learning it can be hard - but shouldn�t be. So teaching it well is important. I
would like to see standard basic TRIZ courses with standard basic TRIZ
recognised qualifications, sold as successfully as other tools like Six Sigma.
This also means having recognised standards for trainers. Can we decide what is
Altshuller�s gift to the world and make it accessible, sellable and useable, and
as a TRIZ community control its development thoughtfully and intelligently? Can
we define and protect the TRIZ Altshuller gave us and laugh loudly when another
new TRIZ company announces they have found 22 new Trends of Evolution or that
Smart Materials are Principle 41 or try to claim ownership of TRIZ for X or Y or
Z? It is important for us in TRIZ to map that which doesn�t change. Once we have
all agreed that, then we can take on innovation of TRIZ and not leave it to a
disparate and disconnected group of individuals with disparate ambitions - those
with TRIZ�s best interests at heart and those with their own - although this may
not be always be a contradiction. <font FACE="Times New Roman"><i>(Editor�s
note: The TRIZ Journal�s position is that people should publish new approaches
to TRIZ and new research on TRIZ, so that other can use it. As in other
sciences, publications which advance the state of TRIZ will be added to the body
of work that is used, and those which do not help people or those where the
research cannot be replicated and used will be ignored. In this way TRIZ will
advance along its own series of �S-curves� as do other developments of human
knowledge and technology.) </p>
</i></font>
<p>When I first learned TRIZ from many including Ellen Domb I was astonished at
its depth and rigour. Most corporate training is to teach some simple techniques
to help people in their work. TRIZ is much much more than that. More serious
training is often in problem solving techniques (Well, they are nearly all
problem analysis tools), which are often reworking of long established and
proven tools complicated up (and priced up) to create a business for those
selling the techniques. What is best for TRIZ?</p>
<p>I expect many of you received the humorous e-mail below (or one like it). I
think that Altshuller taught it like number one, which is how most of us try to
do it, but we have those who teach it like number three, and TRIZ for management
often resembles number five, and I wouldn�t dare comment on those who make TRIZ
like number six.</p>

<p>How we teach TRIZ is linked to the development of TRIZ. How can we honour
Altshuller by continuing his work? TRIZ is for innovation so how can we innovate
TRIZ without damaging Altshuller�s original work? Those who are now trying are
both very clever and less clever, who chooses between them? TRIZ, or that their
work is the new S-Curve of TRIZ? Does it matter? </p>
<p>This brought me to the contradiction of creating a new tradition, which then
can�t be changed because it is a tradition. I was pondering this last week when
a sermon on Abraham at Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford by the famous
theologian Canon Oliver O�Donovan seemed to give me some answers and new lines
of thought. As TRIZ is based on analogous thinking, the analogy of founding
religions does not seem inappropriate. This was the theme of the sermon.</p>
<b>
<p>Abraham Father of us all�</b> Father of a race, father of a family of
religions, father of many nations was the founder of it all. What is a founder?
Someone who starts a tradition that extends over many generations, whose
followers are part of the practice that is carried on. The founder is one to
whom the tradition must be faithful. The contradiction is that the one to whom
the tradition is faithful is himself faithful to no tradition. He is the
beginning everyone else is the continuation. The founder has no duty to look
back to check his authenticity against the standard he received. Abraham the
Father was most unlike his children. Abraham abandoned his home and family for
new lands, he was a wanderer, a polygamist and prepared to do human sacrifice on
his own son. Very different to the tradition he founded- I am paraphrasing a
great theologian here .. not trying to shock.</p>
<p>Canon O�Donovan then summed this up. �Though a tradition must be faithful to
its founder, between the tradition and the founder there is opposition. The
founder is everything his successors are not. He begins from nothing, makes all
mistakes, takes risks, and leaves behind something that wasn�t there before.
They inherit, learn his lessons, avoid his mistakes, and leave behind something
that is still strong. They are not faithful to the founder by beginning again
where he began; we are Abraham�s children by going on where he left off. Our
duty to Abraham is not to imitate him but of moral continuity. Religious
founders are of course different to other founders, Abraham received a call: and
without the call he would not have been a believer but a booby, not a founder
but a fathead.� </p>
<p>So how do we honour Altshuller and continue his tradition? Certainly not by
beginning again where he began and claiming there are 30 (or 11, or 15, or�) not
8 trends of evolution. And probably not by publishing articles (Ref.1) moaning
that TRIZ is too hard, like the one recently which made several potential
customers stop and wonder if it was that hard and unsuccessful, should they even
try? That author is to Oxford Creativity what both Alla Zusman and Ellen Domb
have commented on in public, that your pupils become your competition. I know he
has had great success with TRIZ so please let�s hear about successes, and
intelligent debate about implementation challenges- but remembering we won�t win
them all we should still learn from each other�s success.</p>
<p>How do we both use Altshuller�s work as our foundations and innovate TRIZ
without distorting his views and work? Can we agree a foundation of TRIZ with
basic courses that work? Can we agree a standard for courses and teaching? One
major company recently told me they had tried TRIZ but what they had used was a
�creativity guru� with a smattering of TRIZ. They needed persuading there was
more to TRIZ than the contradiction matrix. </p>
<p>The excellent Altshuller Institute and ETRIA are both in place to further
TRIZ work that is their approach to TRIZ consultants who invest years of their
lives to making TRIZ work in companies? Can we stop poncing about on academic
issues and simply agree between us how to get recognised professional standards
in the implementation of TRIZ to the engineers and scientists working in the
industries of the world? That�s where TRIZ is going to help the world quickly
and effectively.</p>
