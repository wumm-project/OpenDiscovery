<p>ABSTRACT</p>
</font></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ, The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, is a powerful
methodology for producing systematic innovation and improving one’s thinking
processes. The application of TRIZ promises enormous benefits to society. Due to
the history of its development, however, TRIZ is relatively unknown to educators
in North American K-12 schools and institutions of higher education. This paper
introduces TRIZ to educators by tracing the development of TRIZ from its origins
to its present form. The paper also introduces the concept of ideality, one of
the basic premises of TRIZ. Examples and case studies are provided to illustrate
concepts and improve understanding about TRIZ. Issues related to curriculum
development are discussed along with suggestions for systematic integration of
TRIZ into K-12, college, and university curricula.</p>

<font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solving problems facing 21<sup>st</sup> century society demands
creativity and innovation. Thus, community and government leaders are asking the
question: &quot;How can we teach children to be creative, innovative, and better
thinkers so that they can become productive members of society?&quot; Creativity and
innovation have also become strategic issues as organizations strive to remain
competitive. Business leaders are asking the question: &quot;How can we teach our
people to be creative and innovative?&quot; </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result, K-12 schools, colleges, and universities have
taken interest in creativity and innovation education. The disciplines of
creativity and innovation are not well understood, however. Many people believe
that creative or innovative thinking is the result of luck or chance. Others
believe that inventive solutions are developed by people who are gifted in some
special way. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some methodologies for improving innovative thinking have
been offered. Those who believe that group dynamics are important to the
innovation process advocate methods such as synectics or brainstorming. Others
advocate working on an idea, allowing time for incubation, and then waiting for
inspiration. Still others believe in the Thomas Edison “trial and error”
approach, which focuses on 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem with relying on luck, genius, trial and error,
etc., is that there is no reliable or repeatable method for teaching or
achieving innovation. Therefore, improving productivity in the area of
innovation becomes problematic [1].</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Edward de Bono, the creator of lateral thinking, demonstrated
that creativity is a skill that can be taught and developed by individuals [2].
De Bono developed many tools, including a curriculum for the direct teaching of
thinking as a basic skill [3]. The curriculum has been used in over thirty
countries.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While de Bono’s work has gained some acceptance in the West,
another distinctive approach to innovation, TRIZ, is relatively unknown. This is
largely due to the fact that TRIZ (pronounced “treez”) was not generally
available to the West until the 1990s. TRIZ, The Theory of Inventive Problem
Solving, provides a methodology by which people can systematically solve
problems and enhance decision-making. Innovation by trial and error is replaced
with a systematic approach [4,5]. The use of TRIZ also affects the neural networks
in the brain, allowing people to become more creative and approach problems from
different angles [6]. By applying TRIZ, “Organized ways of thinking replace the
old chaotic ones”[76].</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Evidence abounds that TRIZ methodology can be applied
successfully by people of all ages, fueling optimism about the diffusion of
TRIZ. Given the lack of knowledge about TRIZ in the West, however, curriculum
development must accompany any effort to diffuse knowledge about TRIZ. This, in
turn, will allow educational institutions to provide systematic instruction in
TRIZ. Before addressing these educational issues, some historical background
about TRIZ is provided below.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>
<p>THE HISTORY OF TRIZ</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ is an acronym for the Russian words Teoriya Resheniya
Izobretatelskikh Zadatch, which, when translated, means Theory of the Solution
of Inventive Problems [8,9]. Today, TRIZ is commonly used to refer to the Theory
of Inventive Problem Solving, a slight variation of the literal translation. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Genrich Altshuller [10] is considered the founder of TRIZ. Altshuller began developing TRIZ in 1946, while employed in the patent
department of the Soviet navy. Under Stalin’s regime, Altshuller and colleagues
studied tens of thousands of author’s certificates (a type invention
registration used in the Soviet Union) and patents (rarely granted in the Soviet
Union) and discovered that principles of inventive thinking existed [11]. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Altshuller was particularly interested in “inventive
problems,” which he defined as problems that had no known solution or problems
for which the known or generally accepted solution created other problems.
Educated as a mechanical engineer, Altshuller noticed inventive problems could
be codified, classified, and solved methodically, just like other engineering
problems” [12]. Altshuller sought to extract knowledge from inventions, compile
that knowledge in usable form, and make the knowledge available to inventors in
any area or discipline [13]. By identifying and categorizing the patterns in
innovative solutions, Altshuller realized that one could gain access to
solutions that would normally be “unavailable” due to one’s specialization or
narrow field of vision. The ideal system would allow inventors to match their
problems to similar standard problems, which would lead to sets of potential
standard solutions. Altshuller [14] wanted results that were not dependent on
personal creativity or psychological techniques, like brainstorming. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While analyzing patents, Altshuller noticed that the same
contradiction had been addressed in unrelated industries. Perhaps even more
intriguing (and disturbing) was the time gap between the applications. Similar
solutions were years apart. Altshuller realized the time gap was unnecessary;
had the solutions been “accessible” to inventors, the solutions would have been
applied much earlier to other areas. For example, the same process (gradually
increase the pressure, then suddenly drop the pressure) is used in sweet pepper
canning, shelling cedar nuts, shelling sunflower seeds, producing powder sugar,
cleaning filters, and splitting imperfect diamond crystals [15]. While the process
in each case is conceptually similar, the date of innovation is not. For
example, there is an eighteen-year gap between the 1968 patent for pepper
canning patent and the 1986 patent for cedar nut shelling [16].</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The combined discovery that there were both regularities in
design evolution and principles used in innovative solutions sparked a
revolution in the field of inventive problem solving [17]. In a 1948 letter to
Stalin, Altshuller and his boyhood friend, Raphael Shapiro, shared their
discovery and voiced concerns about future inventions in the Soviet Union [18,19].
Their views were not well received; they were interrogated and tortured, then
sentenced to twenty-five years in a prison camp above the Artic Circle [20,21]. This
proved to be a sort of blessing in disguise, as the camp contained professors,
scientists, etc. In 1954, about a year after Stalin’s death, Altshuller and
Shaprio were released, which allowed them to publish their first article in
1956; Shapiro published the first book on TRIZ in 1961, but later lost interest
in furthering the dissemination of TRIZ [22]. Over the next few decades,
professionals applied TRIZ to multiple disciplines, and the methodology
improved. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of resistance by the State Committee of Inventive
Affairs and the Society of Inventors (Altshuller was an intellectual Jew),
Altshuller went underground, writing science fiction stories under the pen name
H. Altov. In the 1970s, Altshuller’s books and articles were finally translated
and circulated in Germany and Poland, and eventually reached Japan and the West
[23]. By the 1980s, Altshuller estimated that close to 100 TRIZ institutes had
been established [24]. TRIZ flourished after perestroika. By 1985, Altshuller had
written over 14 books, which constitute the collection of ideas and principles
now known as Classical TRIZ, which include ARIZ (the Algorithm for Inventive
Problem Solving) and Substance-Field analysis. The breakup of the Soviet Union
provided many challenges and opportunities. Many TRIZ experts left Eastern
Europe when North American businesses expressed an interest in applying TRIZ to
their problems. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>
<p>BASIC PREMISES OF CLASSICAL TRIZ</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many traditional approaches to creativity and innovation have
a fatal flaw: as the complexity of the problem increases, the efficiency and
effectiveness of the method decreases. For example, while all innovation
requires some elements of trial and error, relying on trial and error to solve
complex problems is terribly inefficient, since the number of trials can be
astronomical [25,26]. Furthermore, trial and error provides no guarantee of a
solution, since the trials may be conducted using the wrong variants [27]. Altshuller was particularly interested in reducing the time required to produce
an invention and developing a structured, repeatable process to enhance
breakthrough thinking [28].</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Altshuller identified three basic premises of TRIZ: ideality,
contradictions, and systems approach. More specifically, “1) the ideal design is
a goal, 2) contradictions help solve problems, and 3) the innovative process can
be structured systematically” [29. While systematic innovation may seem like an
oxymoron, TRIZ is built on the “realization that contradictions can be
methodically resolved through application of innovative solutions” [30]. The
following section of this paper focuses only on the first premise of Classical
TRIZ, ideality. Future papers will address the larger body of TRIZ, which is
continually evolving. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>
<p>IDEALITY</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When approaching any problem, there are two possible points
of view. The first is aimed at improving the current undesired situation by
asking: “How can we improve the current situation or process?” The second point
of view starts from a vision of ideality and asks: “What is the ideal solution?”
The distinction is critical, since each point of view leads one down a different
path and toward different sets of possible solutions [31]. TRIZ attacks problems
from the second point of view.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All systems have useful effects and harmful effects. Anything
of value created by the system’s functioning is a useful effect. The domain of
harmful effects can be equally large (the system’s costs, the space it uses, the
fuel it uses, the noise it makes, etc.). Altshuller defined ideality as the
quotient of the sum of the system’s useful effects (U<sub>i</sub>) divided by the sum
of the system’s harmful effects (Hj). Thus, ideality is expressed as:</p>
            <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
            <p align="left">
            <img SRC="Image230.gif" width="122" height="48"></p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Altshuller noted that as systems evolve, they increase their
degree of ideality. In other words, the sum of useful effects trend upward and
the sum of harmful effects trend downward. Systems become more efficient and
effective, although they rarely reach perfection. From this idea, Altshuller
introduced the concept of the Ideal Final Result (IFR): the useful effects are
great and the harmful effects are reduced to zero. In other words, in the ideal
system, the function is performed without the existence of the system [32,33]. For
example, the IFR for a machine is that the function of the machine is completed,
but there is no machine [34,35]. Thus, in TRIZ nomenclature, ideality represents the
state in which performing a desired function or effect occurs without the need
for the system. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While it is quite rare to achieve ideality, using ideality as
a goal is very effective at reducing psychological inertia. By defining the IFR,
one is led in the direction of completely different solution paths [36]. Rather
than concentrating on small, incremental improvements, one imagines the ideal
state in which the desired function occurs, but the problem is absent.
Traditional problem solving involves compromises and trade-offs, but ideality
pursues solutions that eliminate the need to compromise [37,38]. For example,
traditional problem solving might lead to compromise that increases the ideality
ratio by increasing both useful and harmful effects. The increase in the useful
effect (numerator) would merely be larger than the increase in the harmful
effect (denominator). Alternatively, similar results could be achieved by
decreasing the harmful effect (denominator) by more than the decrease in the
useful effect (numerator). In contrast, TRIZ improves the ideality ratio by
increasing the useful effect (numerator) while simultaneously decreasing the
harmful effect (denominator). </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Terninko, Zusman, and Zlotin [39] outline six paths to improve
ideality. These are presented below along with examples [see 40,41]:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Exclude auxiliary functions. Examples:
      Painting without solvents is accomplished by using an electrostatic field
      to coat metal parts with powdered paint. The parts are heated and the
      powder melts. The German C11 automatic rifle uses cartridges that have no
      cases. The expensive brass case was eliminated.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Exclude elements and delegate the functions of
      those system elements to resources. Example: The expensive transmission
      that drives the propeller blades on the tail of a helicopter can be
      eliminated by directing a stream of exhaust gas from the motor onto the
      main blades to stabilize the helicopter.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Identify self-service. Example: See the
      Container Destruction Problem case later in this paper.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Replace elements, parts, or total system (use
      a model or copy). Examples: Airports simulate landing gear wheel traction
      using a test vehicle on the runway. Barbers in training can practice
      shaving balloons that are covered with shaving cream.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Change or simplify the principle of operation.
      Example: To prevent sagging, hot sheets of glass are rolled on a pool of
      molten tin instead of a conveyor with rollers.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Utilize resources (substances, fields, field
      properties, functional characteristics, or other attributes in the
      system). Examples: Exhaust pipes on trucks operating in deep open pits can
      be directed into the truck bed, allowing the coal, rock, etc., to filter
      out fumes. Snow can be blown into coalmines to cool the air and prevent
      explosions.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since utilizing resources is at the heart of achieving
ideality, the following section is devoted to that topic.</p>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key to achieving ideality in a structured and repeatable
way is to identify resources already existing in the system that can be used to
fix the problem. These resources can be used as is or combined to perform the
function [42,43]. If the resources already exist, they do not have to be purchased.
This means that the problem has been solved at no additional cost. Since cost is
a harmful factor, the solution moves the system closer to becoming an ideal
system. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An abundance of resources exists in most systems, and TRIZ
practitioners are adept at identifying these resources. Many resources are
things normally thought of as harmful side effects (e.g., vibration or heat).
TRIZ practitioners examine whether they can convert these resources into
something that can solve the problem. Other resources appear non-existent. For
example, Terninko, Zusman, and Zlotin [44] point out that dead space is a resource
used for temperature insulation (Thermo Pane windows) and sound insulation
(sound baffles).</p>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ideality and Resources Case Study #1: Container Destruction
Problem</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Container Destruction Problem is real world example
widely used in the TRIZ literature [45,46,47,48,49] to illustrate how resources can be
used to move a system towards ideality. This case involves a company that tests
the resistance of a metal alloy to an acid environment. The metal alloy specimen
is placed in a container filled with acid. After some time, the container is
emptied and the specimen is inspected to determine what effects the acid had on
the specimen. Unfortunately, the acid also damages the walls of the container,
corrupting and invalidating the test results. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The case becomes more complex if one assumes the company
performs tests for thousands of customers and has laboratory space filled with
thousands of testing containers. The company realizes that customers have been
gradually increasing the resistance of the products they manufacture. To make
matters worse, the customers have increased the specifications for the tests
(stronger acids, length of time, etc.). Therefore, the problem will not go away.
Typical non-TRIZ solutions are to use a container made of a different material
or to coat the containers with a special material. Assume the cost of either
proposed solution is prohibitive. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To define ideality in the Container Destruction Problem, one
first identifies the system. The system that contains the degradation problem is
the container. It holds the acid and the specimen. By definition, ideality
consists of having the function performed (acid in contact with specimen)
without the existence of the system (the container). </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ideality is often achieved by performing the function with
existing resources. The obvious resources in this system include the container,
the specimen, and the acid. According to ideality, the container should not
exist, so the focus is directed at the other resources. Focusing on the
specimen, additional resources can be identified (geometric resources include
size, shape, volume, etc.). The acid has resources, too (fluidity, specific
gravity, volume, etc.). The environment surrounding the specimen and acid
contains resources such as gravity, temperature, humidity, etc. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ practitioners develop the ability to find resources
inside the system that contains the problem and use these resources to solve the
problem. Often they transform resources or recombine resources in new ways. In
this case, gravity, the fluidity of the acid, and the shape of the specimen were
combined to create a solution. By changing the shape of the specimen, it became
the container for the acid. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As mentioned earlier, TRIZ emphasizes achieving ideality
using a structured and repeatable method. The process must be teachable and
transferable to be valuable [50]. Whether one can solve the Container Destruction
Problem is not the issue. One must be able to produce inventive solutions
(ideality) consistently. TRIZ provides the structured methodology for achieving
that goal. </p>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perspectives on Ideality</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ideality has subsets, since it can be defined from many
perspectives. The ideal cell phone would have different meanings to different
parties (the designer, the manufacturer, the distributor, the user). Even the
users might have different views of the ideal cell phone, depending on whether
it was used at home, at the office, or while traveling. The Container
Destruction Problem was approached from the testing company’s point of view. The
container manufacturer would have a different view regarding how to solve the
problem. In summary, innovation can be driven from many different points of view
[51].</p>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local Ideality</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since ideality involves solving problems with existing
resources, the solution will differ based on the environment and location in
which the problem is present. The manufacturer of cell phone batteries may have
made a significant capital investment to generate profits. The manufacturer
would focus on using existing resources to generate a solution. At the same
time, one should not ignore higher-level forms of ideality, such as performing
the cell phone’s energy function without a battery. The Container Destruction
Problem solution involved the ability (resource) to drill a hole in the specimen
or have the specimens already delivered by customers in unique shapes.
Understanding local ideality is critical. Ideality is achieved through
resources, so local resources will be used to achieve local ideality [52].</p>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Super-Effects</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Super-effects are often achieved when one approaches a near
ideal solution; the value-added outcome exceeds expectations. The Container
Destruction Problem solution illustrates several possible super-effects: 1) the
company may have freed up considerable lab space, since containers no longer
need to be stored; 2) investment in containers was reduced to zero; and 3) costs
associated with handling, storing, and cleaning containers were eliminated. </p>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Derived Resources</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most resources fall into one or more categories: readily
available resources, substance resources, and derived resources. Readily
available resources can be used in their existing state. Substance resources
include material from which the system and its environment are composed; any
system that has not reached ideality has substance resources [53]. While some
resources are easily identifiable in a system, other resources are hidden within
these resources. The hidden resources are called derived resources, since they
are derived from combining, transforming, concentrating, and/or intensifying
readily available resources [54]. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ experts develop the ability to identify, modify, and
combine resources. By looking deep inside the system, TRIZ practitioners
discover new opportunities. In the Container Destruction Problem, the specimen
was a resource. As one drills down deeper, one realizes the specimen has shape.
Going still deeper, the word shape reveals myriad resources, such as diameter,
roundness, surface finish, and height [55]. TRIZ practitioners do not generate
long lists of resources and derived resources, however. They learn to find the
right combination of resources without creating an exhaustive list of resources
and potential combinations.</p>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondary Problems</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Implementing a solution may present new problems (e.g., how
to change the shape of the specimen). TRIZ classifies these as secondary
problems. Most people abandon ideas because of secondary problems. This is a
mistake, since secondary problems are usually much easier to solve than primary
problems. Therefore, a solution should not be discarded because secondary
problems surface. Secondary problems should be documented so that they can be
addressed. In fact, the exact same TRIZ methodology is applied to secondary
problems to eliminate them.</p>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ideality and Resources Case Study #2: Pharmaceutical Tablet
Inspection Problem</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following case study [56] illustrates how ideality and
resources were combined to solve another real world problem. A 100-year old
pharmaceutical company determines the need to reduce labor costs associated with
inspection of a high-volume product. The product is produced in tablet form. At
the end of the production cycle, the tablets move up a vibratory bowl, are
discharged from the bowl, and slide down an inclined plane onto a conveyor.
Three people visually inspect the tablets. Tablets are evaluated as good or bad
(chipped) before packaging. Chipped tablets are discarded into a trash can. The
production operation has been optimized to the point where all 15 manufacturing
stages prior to inspection are best in class. Only 1% of the tablets are damaged
at each stage in production. The output is 100,000 tablets per shift. The damage
occurs in all 15 stages in roughly equivalent amounts. The result is 15,000
defective tablets per shift, which is unacceptable for packaging purposes.
Management has determined that further optimization of the production process is
not an option. It is already best in class.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Engineering recommends two solutions. One is a computerized
visual inspection system and separation system with a total cost of $225,000.
The other is a state-of-the-art computer-controlled weighing and separating
system that weighs tablets and compares each tablet with the expected weight of
a non-defective tablet. The cost of this system is the same, although there is
some concern that a second system would be needed due to productivity concerns.
Management deems that neither solution is acceptable; it would be trading
low-cost inspection for high-cost equipment and technicians. Management wants a
solution that costs less than $1000.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For this case, ideality is defined as follows: the function
(inspection and sorting of the tablets) should be performed without the
existence of the system (the three inspectors). In other words, the tablet
should inspect itself. The next step is identifying resources. Although
thousands of resources could be found, the engineers have already identified the
resources for a near ideal solution. The visual inspection system used
wavelengths of light interacting with the tablet surface. The term “visual”
contains other possibilities, such as surface condition, color, reflectivity,
tint, shading, etc. The weighing system used weight, which can be defined as the
force with which gravity pulls on an object in proportion to its mass. Note that
both engineering solutions also focused on what was different between good and
defective tablets and how that difference could be detected.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The solution involved creating interaction between defective
tablets and the inclined plane. The tablets were rolled on their edge down the
plane. The conveyor was moved to create a gap between the inclined plane and the
conveyor. The non-defective tablets rolled faster and crossed the gap to the
conveyor. The defective tablets had less velocity, so they fell into the trash
can, which was positioned between the plane and the conveyor. Thus, the
resources of gravitational pull, the inclined plane, the velocity of the rolling
tablet, the length of the plane, etc., were all combined to create a near ideal
solution.</p>

<p>DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS for triz education</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One can attempt to solve problems using only personal
capabilities and personal knowledge. TRIZ recognizes, however, that applying a
methodology and tools significantly leverages one’s personal capabilities and
personal knowledge. Clarke notes that TRIZ provides “the tools to turn anyone
with a reasonable amount of intelligence and a little desire into an inventive
genius” [57]. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Terninko, Zusman, and Zlotin [58] point out that once one
embraces the TRIZ methodology, several changes in thinking occur: 1) tradeoffs
and compromise are no longer acceptable, 2) everything becomes a resource for
the inventive solution, 3) ideality becomes an expectation rather than a dream,
and 4) contradictions will become not only acceptable but attractive.
Furthermore, the more one uses TRIZ, the more one will integrate TRIZ
methodology with other problem solving methodologies, enhancing their
effectiveness. This means, for example, that people using lateral thinking will
benefit from learning TRIZ. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same time, TRIZ is not designed to replace one’s
problem solving methods. No tool or method is appropriate for all problems. For
simple problems, trial and error may be an appropriate problem-solving tool.
When the situation is complex and an innovative method is required for
systematically creating solutions, TRIZ will likely be the best tool.</p>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Issues for Curriculum Development</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since TRIZ education and training are provided in many forms,
there is a need to develop curriculum standards. The Education Committee of the
Altshuller Institute (AI) is working with TRIZ instructors (educators,
consultants, schools, and organizations) to establish minimal standards for TRIZ
courses and curricula. The AI Education Committee proposes that courses be
classified at three levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Each level, in
turn, must meet specific learning objectives. For more information about the
scope and sequence of the learning objectives, see the AI website [59].</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any TRIZ curriculum should be designed to give people a
working knowledge of TRIZ. The implication is clear: merely gaining conceptual
knowledge about TRIZ is insufficient. To benefit from TRIZ, one must practice
and apply TRIZ on a regular basis. Therefore, any solid TRIZ curriculum
initiative must address the issues of practice and application as well as
conceptual knowledge. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Imposing a “one size fits all” model to TRIZ education
appears unwise, however. Mann [60] points out that TRIZ students fall into at
least four different profiles. The first group decides, after some minimal level
of training, that TRIZ is not for them. The second group simply embraces
whatever TRIZ tool most closely fits the way they already work and think. The
third group continues to learn new TRIZ tools over time. This group experiences
success with one or more tools. Ironically, for this group, the motivation to
learn more about TRIZ is related to the fact that the user’s current set of TRIZ
tools eventually fails to produce results; the user realizes the need for other
TRIZ tools. The fourth group is “infected” with the TRIZ virus. These TRIZ
zealots are motivated to learn as much about TRIZ as possible. Clearly, one
challenge that lies ahead is developing curricula that meet the needs of
different types of students.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Curriculum development goals can be advanced with or without
the use of software. Many TRIZ instructors use software to facilitate the
learning process. TRIZ software applications differ considerably, however. Some
instructors use software to provide relatively simple tools and deliver
information. Others rely on more sophisticated software to mask some of the
complexities of TRIZ, with the goal of reducing the amount of practice and
knowledge one needs to be effective using TRIZ. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Conversely, some instructors focus on teaching TRIZ without
the aid of computers or software. For them, the choice is equally deliberate,
based on pedagogical philosophy and experience. Regardless of one’s position on
the use of computers to deliver TRIZ instruction, it is clear that computers
will provide opportunities to enhance future developments of TRIZ curriculum.
</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that students of various ages have applied TRIZ
successfully fuels optimism about the potential impact TRIZ can have on the U.S.
education system. Advocates for curriculum development point to the need to
provide systematic instruction to students. Ironically, one barrier to overcome
with students is the notion that structure or methodology impedes creativity and
innovation. De Bono [61] is quick to point out that all structures are not
confining. Many structures (e.g., a ladder) are liberating since they allow
people to do more with them than without them. Simply put, tools make tasks
easier for people. Creativity and innovation tools, like TRIZ, are no different.</p>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Integrating TRIZ into the Curriculum</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Formal education needs to be part of the solution, rather
than part of the problem [62]. Formal education overloads students with
information (which alone does not make a person creative). As students acquire
more education, they also quit believing in fairly tales, which are loaded with
contradictions. Terninko, Zusman, and Zlotin [63] cite a 1912 study by Antwan
Ribaut that found creativity peaked at age eighteen, then decreased over one’s
lifetime. They note that Altshuller’s replication of Ribaut’s study in the 1970s
found the age to be fourteen. Finally, they cite Zlotin’s 1980 study, which
found that creativity reached its lifetime low at age twenty-one. Zlotin’s study
suggested that colleges and universities actually reduce creativity among
students. Clearly, there is a need to integrate TRIZ (and other creative
thinking tools) into the standard curriculum to address this problem.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Multiple entry points for integrating TRIZ into the
curriculum exist. Obvious examples in higher education include engineering
schools, business schools, and science programs. Engineering schools in North
America are already beginning to embrace TRIZ, due to its impressive ability to
deliver innovative solutions to technical problems. (See, for example, the
mechanical engineering program at Wayne State University.) In the foreseeable
future, TRIZ will be a required subject in engineering programs. </p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Diffusion to Business Schools. </b>Business schools will
follow engineering schools for several reasons. First, the success of TRIZ in
engineering programs will stimulate interest at business schools. Second, some
natural diffusion will occur, since many engineers pursue MBA degrees. These
engineers will bring their existing knowledge of TRIZ to the business schools.
Third, the science of TRIZ includes the evolution of future generations of
systems. This knowledge is invaluable for developing business strategy,
developing new products, and erecting patent fences. Fourth, while TRIZ was
developed to solve technical problems, the application of TRIZ to the solution
of non-technical problems is evolving at a rapid pace. For example, Mann and
Domb [64] developed a fascinating list of existing business applications/practices
and classified them in a way that mirrors Altshuller’s 40 Inventive Principles.
Ruchti and Livotov [65] developed a TRIZ-based system for resolving organizational
issues in business and management. Hipple [66] illustrates how the separation
principles, originally developed to resolve technical problems, can be applied
to non-technical problems in organizations. In short, the capability to develop
solutions to non-technical business problems will make TRIZ indispensable across
the business curriculum. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Entrepreneurship provides perhaps the best entry point into
the business school curriculum, since the benefits of TRIZ are realized
immediately. Dissemination of TRIZ to the broader curriculum will follow, and
Quinn’s [67] Competing Values Framework (CVF) is uniquely suited for that task.
The CVF acknowledges the existence of paradoxes and the co-existence of
seemingly opposite demands on organizations and managers. While a description of
the CVF is beyond the scope of this paper, some examples are presented below.
</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Competing Values Framework.</b> From an organizational
effectiveness perspective, the CVF identifies Innovation/Adaptation as the
conceptual opposite of Stability/Control. Improving organizational effectiveness
by increasing the Innovation/Adaptation parameter will result in a decrease in
the Stability/Control parameter. The organization’s attempt to become more
effective (approach ideality) results in a technical contradiction. The typical
method for dealing with contradictions is compromise or trade-off. TRIZ resolves
contradictions without compromise, however. The CVF also takes a unique
approach; it recognizes that opposite parameters can co-exist; people only
assume the parameters are mutually exclusive in a real system. In fact, the CVF
is based on the belief that it is actually desirable to pursue opposing
parameters simultaneously. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The CVF also identifies eight roles performed by effective
managers or leaders; each role has a conceptual opposite. For example, the
conceptual opposite of the Monitor Role is the Broker Role. The result is a
technical contradiction. As the manager devotes more energy or attention to
performing the Monitor Role, the manager moves away from performing the Broker
Role. The manager’s attempt to become more effective (approach ideality) results
in a technical contradiction. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Physical contradictions are at the heart of the CVF. For
example, an effective manager is a Broker and is not a Broker. Clearly, the
separation principles can be used to resolve this physical contradiction.
Finally, the CVF emphasizes the need for innovation and creativity; one of the
eight roles, classified as the Innovator Role, is devoted to this end. In
summary, the CVF provides a unique framework for integrating TRIZ into the
overall business curriculum. </p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Decision Making.</b> Ruchti and Livotov [68] argue that
TRIZ-based thinking methods can improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of
decision making in organizations. They note that, although sophisticated
decision making tools and methodologies are used in many organizational areas
(product development, supply chain management, production, etc.), many other
managerial decisions are based largely on intuition and personal experience.
TRIZ-based tools could offer managers access to systematic and powerful thinking
tools that would assist them in making day-to-day decisions. While undergraduate
and MBA programs should provide instruction in TRIZ, Executive Education
programs should be strategic targets for diffusing knowledge about TRIZ. At the
very least, executives need to be exposed to TRIZ, since they control the
resources necessary to advance TRIZ instruction in their organizations.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Science Education. </b>Potential application for TRIZ in the
sciences is unlimited. TRIZ yields tremendous efficiencies in the sciences by
systematically eliminating the majority of solution variants and providing
completely new solutions paths for research. This promises to revolutionize the
scientific method and accelerate scientific discoveries. TRIZ-educated students
in physics, chemistry, biology, etc., will not only leverage their disciplinary
knowledge, but also draw upon knowledge found in other disciplines. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crucial task is to reach science instructors and educate
them about TRIZ. This may prove to be difficult. Most science instruction is
narrow in focus and scientific research is even narrower in focus. This is due
to the belief that a high degree of specialization is required to advance each
scientific sub-field. TRIZ has the potential to liberate both science
instruction and scientific research by leveraging knowledge found across
scientific disciplines and providing an entirely new methodology for solving
problems.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">K-12 Curriculum. </b>The call to integrate TRIZ into the K-12
curriculum is as strong as the educational imperative in higher education. The
need to teach students to think clearly has never been greater. (See [69] for a
third-grade course that utilizes TRIZ.) The entry points and issues for
integrating TRIZ into the K-12 curriculum are similar to those of higher
education. Teaching science classes to middle school or high school students
without giving them access to TRIZ is doing students a great disservice.
Traditionally, acquiring knowledge in the sciences has been separate from the
ability to apply scientific knowledge. While educators might deny that
assertion, studies show repeatedly that students using TRIZ can apply scientific
principles to develop solutions when their “book knowledge” of science has
failed them [70,71]. TRIZ unequivocally leverages scientific knowledge and unlocks
the power of science. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ has the capability to make science far more interesting
to students. Because students systematically discover solutions that involve
applications of scientific knowledge, they begin to see immediate value in the
sciences. In an era in which student interest in science education is of
concern, it is heartening to realize that TRIZ may prove to be an effective way
to stimulate students’ interest in the sciences. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The perceived need to develop entrepreneurial skills and
attitudes among children in the United States is shared widely. In response,
schools have introduced curricula designed to develop these skills and
attitudes. The benefit of integrating TRIZ into such programs is self-evident.
In Ames, IA, middle school students were exposed to TRIZ as a tool to advance
entrepreneurial spirit with astounding results [72,73]. The program was designed to
determine if there was a better way to teach young students to be inventive
problem solvers and entrepreneurs. Previous attempts to improve students’
problem solving had been modest. The results of the TRIZ-based program were
dramatic.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Summary.</b> TRIZ deserves to hold its own place in the
curriculum. Ideally, if TRIZ were taught as a separate subject, it would be
formally integrated into other areas of the curriculum. Even without formal
integration, however, students instructed in TRIZ methodology will develop the
ability to think differently. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Integrating TRIZ into the curriculum may take time, since
curriculum development is both difficult and political. The greatest challenge
facing TRIZ proponents is the natural resistance to change embedded in most
organizational cultures. Furthermore, the cultures of educational institutions
are among the most resistant to change. Organizational cultures that embrace and
institutionalize change will be needed to integrate TRIZ into the curriculum
successfully.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s society faces a world replete with complex problems
begging for innovative solutions. A methodology is needed to address these 21st
century problems. Today’s businesses operate in an environment characterized by
change and competitive pressures. This environment requires a problem solving
methodology for systematically eliminating roadblocks to new business processes
and new product development processes. To be of value, any such methodology must
be reliable, repeatable and teachable. TRIZ meets these criteria. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although TRIZ was originally applied to technical problem
solving, it has evolved into a system for creative thinking and innovation
appropriate for a multiplicity of applications. TRIZ has grown to include
applications for education, business, social and political issues, as well as
the sciences [74]. TRIZ even includes systematic methods for forecasting the
future development of technologies, uncovering causes for disasters, and
eliminating potential disasters. New applications are continually appearing in
<i>The TRIZ Journal </i>[75].</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Integrating TRIZ into the curriculum is an educational
imperative. Due to the circumstances surrounding the historical development of
TRIZ, however, only a limited number of people have a working knowledge of TRIZ.
The number of people capable of providing instruction in TRIZ is even smaller.
This presents a challenge for developing TRIZ curriculum and for systematically
integrating TRIZ into mainstream education venues. Curriculum development and
integration are critical, however, to the diffusion process. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While developing curriculum, educators must keep in mind that
students vary considerably in terms of their desire to learn TRIZ. The
curriculum must be designed to help students achieve success in the early stages
of training. The degree to which students experience success is believed to be a
critical factor in determining whether they will continue to expand their TRIZ
knowledge base [76].</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ practitioners and specialists continue to build upon
Altshuller's work, further advancing the science of TRIZ. Creating a mechanism
for diffusing these advancements provides yet another challenge. Organizations,
such as the Altshuller Institute, can play a critical role in that diffusion
process, serving as liaisons between TRIZ specialists and North American
educational institutions. Computer technology may also aid the diffusion process
and offer new opportunities for TRIZ instruction.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The challenge facing K-12 schools, colleges, and universities
is leading the dissemination of knowledge about the science and practice of
TRIZ. These institutions will need to make a deliberate effort to incorporate
TRIZ into their curricula. They will be dependent on liaisons, however, who can
bridge the gap between TRIZ specialists and educational institutions.</p>
