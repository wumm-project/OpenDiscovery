<p></p>
<p>Value Engineering: A Plan for Invention</b> is related to TRIZ through its
intense focus on rigorous function definition and analysis and a structured job
plan application process as a pathway to improvement and creativity for
products, systems and projects. It further gives considerable attention to
various forms and expressions of value equations (principally Value = Function /
Cost) that may help students of TRIZ gain deeper understanding of Ideality.
Discussions of barriers to creativity are reminiscent of the TRIZ concerns with
psychological inertia. </p>
<p>The book is divided into four sections and includes extensive appendices:</p>
<p>Section I: The World Around Us</p>
<p>The author presents Value Engineering as a management system, and offers a
review against capsule summaries of other popular management systems for
organizing, defining, identifying and improving diverse operations. These
reviewed systems include Management by Objectives, Kepner-Tregoe, Taguchi
Methods, Quality Function Deployment, Kaizen, TQC, FMEA, Simultaneous
Engineering, Benchmarking, and TRIZ. These systems all together are considered
as tools for a toolbox. All are scored by the author for their utility to a
broad set of business applications and criteria. He predictably finds VE by far
the most powerful. Unfortunately, only limited and elementary versions of
several of the systems are described and used as a basis for comparison. </p>
<p>Section II: The Economics of Profit</p>
<p>Discusses Cost, its elements, and various techniques to estimate, analyze,
and determine the costs of products, systems, and projects. </p>
<p>Chapter 5 in this section is titled �Function: The Foundation of Clarity�. It
is likely this chapter, together with its application in chapter 12, are the
most important in the text. Mr. Park observes that function definition and
function analysis are the elements of VE that set it apart from other management
systems. He introduces and defines the concepts of Function as the objective of
an action, and emphasizes that two-word, verb-noun definitions of a function are
imperative for in-depth understanding. The author offers this requirement as a
forcing technique to help assure �maximum creative opportunity is achieved.� The
author provides guidelines for defining verb-noun function statements (which may
<u>not</u> include the word �provide�), emphasizes they should be measurable in
unit terms, should offer creative opportunity, and introduces example statements
for both products and operations.</p>
<p>This section also includes a chapter on Value, its definition and
measurement, and a chapter on Quality, as a component of Value. These
discussions, always related to function, may be useful to those students of TRIZ
who are seeking a deeper understanding of the concepts of Ideality. </p>
<p>Section III: The Human Element</p>
<p>This section includes four survey chapters on communications, motivation,
teams and teamwork, and creativity. The discussion of creativity espouses
brainstorming and a technique named Blast-Create-Refine as the principal
recommended methods. No mention is made of TRIZ, even though it was explicitly
reviewed earlier in the book. </p>
<p>These chapters do not present themselves as new work. They do offer a concise
and potentially useful introductory guide for students of TRIZ who are not
practiced in facilitating problem solving or innovation teams.</p>
<p>Section IV: The Sum of the Parts - A Practical Method </p>
<p>Described by the author as the objective of the book, this section brings
together all the elements that have been developed in previous sections, and
presents them in a very workable guide to Value Engineering application. The Job
Plan, a multi phase structured team approach to guide analysis and creativity,
is introduced and developed. The Argus chart, the author�s version of FAST
diagramming, is demonstrated. This provides a graphical representation of an
entire product / process / project, based on a why-how-when analysis of
functional relationships.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 - �Value Engineering: A Total System� provides an extensive
product based case study example illustrating the use of the job plan and
function definition and analysis. The case study is a multi-year application of
VE, with work sheets, showing the progression from analysis of an existing
product to implementation of a new design. The case is well illustrated and
informative.</p>
<p>Approaches to organize and implement a VE system in a business are discussed,
and the book closes with a collection of mini-case study examples of
applications ranging from industrial equipment, to construction projects, to
automotive assemblies, to business re-engineering and social studies, to a small
parts analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Appendices</b></p>
<p>An extensive appendix contains methods summaries, worksheets for the elements
of the author�s approach to Value Engineering applications, and �Park�s Catalog
of Frequently Used Functions In Value Engineering�. This catalog is based on the
author�s varied project experiences. It includes 277 verbs and 446 nouns, and is
organized for multiple applications in ten categories. The categories are:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Administration/Management Information Systems</li>
  <li>Capital Equipment Product Analysis</li>
  <li>Government/Community Affairs</li>
  <li>Hospitals/Healthcare</li>
  <li>Manufacturing</li>
  <li>Personnel</li>
  <li>Product Analysis</li>
  <li>Product Planning/Marketing/Advertising</li>
  <li>Real Estate/Building Management/Construction</li>
  <li>Technical Operations</li>
</ul>
<p>Alphabetic listings of all the function verbs and nouns utilized in these
categories are also provided. These listings are offered as example, and to
demonstrate process. The author has previously cautioned that teams or
individuals cannot just copy lists of functions for similar applications, but
must actually follow the process to get real results. These examples and
listings should be extremely valuable to the TRIZ practioner who is not already
highly experienced in function analysis.</p>
<b>
<p>Value Engineering: A Plan for Invention</b> overviews the concepts and
methods the author has utilized in an extensive consulting practice, especially
his Argus chart methodology of constructing FAST diagrams, and his particular
approach to job planning. As noted above, VE is presented as a management
system. The author repeatedly expresses his opinion that it is the most complete
and powerful of all the systems he catalogs. </p>
<p>The book is readable, well illustrated with case studies and examples,
provides both background and working tools, and should be of considerable
interest to students and practitioners of TRIZ.</p>
