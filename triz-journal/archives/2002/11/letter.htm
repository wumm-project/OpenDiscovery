<p>Critique on &#8220;The Simplified TRIZ&#8221;-book, and the Book Review</p>
</b>
<p>By Pentti Soderlin<br>
Management Consultant<br>
Helsinki, Finland<br>
<a href="mailto:pentti.soderlin@netlife.fi">pentti.soderlin@netlife.fi</a></p>
<p>I have been reading a book on TRIZ, namely <i>&#8220;Simplified TRIZ: New
Problem-Solving Applications for Engineers &amp; Manufacturing Professionals&#8221;</i> by
Ellen Domb, Ph.D, and Kalevi Rantanen. </p>
<p><a href="../../archives/2002/06/g/index.htm">In the June number of TRIZ-Journal</a> Dr.
Michael S. Slocum and Ms. Catherine Lundberg have reviewed the book<i>. </i>The
TRIZ part of the book has been rewritten or translated from the previous book in
Finnish by Mr. K. Rantanen. Ms. Domb has probably written the latter part of the
book. However this is not clearly stated or mentioned in the book.</p>
<i>
<p>I cannot recommend this book to any potential reader.</p>
</i><b>
<p>The review</p>
</b>
<p>Suppose you are searching a book to get acquainted with TRIZ and you will
find this book review. What do you expect? The beginning of the review loads you
with superlative expectations: <i>&#8220;&#8230;excellent introduction,&#8230; directed to
professionals, &#8230;to learning a new science&#8221; </i>to quote but the first three
lines.</p>
<p>The uncritical and misleading text continues already in the next paragraph:
<i>&#8230; authors do outstanding job&#8230;, the examples are clear, concise,&#8230; personal
examples, &#8230; technical and manufacturing examples&#8230;</p>
</i>
<p>Apart from explaining the topics, the review praises even more the authors:
<i>... the authors are well versed,&#8230; have done excellent job, &#8230; the book is ...
a positive contribution,&#8230; the authors should be commended&#8230;, the book is a must&#8230;</p>
</i><b>
<p>For your information: I cannot agree. </p>
<font SIZE="2">
<dir>
  <dir>
    </font></b><i>
    <p>I don&#8217;t know how to describe the book, the book review and what kind of
    epitome to give each of these. So misleading and uncritical a review one
    hardly ever reads. So confusing is the book itself.</p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>
<b>
<p>What do you expect from a book review?</p>
</b>
<p>What is the function of a book review? The answer is very simple and obvious:
it serves as a recommendation or guide especially to a hesitating potential
buyer or newcomer. Normally the buyer expects to hear not only positive comments
but also possible faults or shortcomings, and even some negative arguments of
the text. This is what I personally think the <i>coutume</i> is, or at least has
been. But &#8220;<i>everything is different in America</i>&#8221;?</p>
<p>Who is responsible if the book is a flop or a complete misinvestment? The
reviewers? The authors? The buyer? Whom to send claims?</p>
<p>There has been a discussion in April number &#8220;If TRIZ is such a good idea, why
isn&#8217;t everyone using it?&#8221; One of the critiques was presented towards TRIZ books.
Why? </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>One major reason might have been the fact that there exist confusing
    books and procedures by different TRIZ writers.</i> <i>This book in question
    is one and not at all a good one. Even the review is a complete flop, a
    disservice for TRIZniks.</p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>
<b>
<p>The Book</p>
</b>
<p>&#8220;Simplified TRIZ&#8221;, what do you expect? Simplification normally means to
explain (to those not familiar), clarify, make simple (pure and simple, easy to
understand), to streamline etc. How does this book contribute to these? It
doesn&#8217;t. </p>
<p>Let us start from the beginning, the terminology. Would it had been more
rewarding if the authors have not caused additional confusion by inventing &#8220;new&#8221;
terminology. I mean the basic concepts like Technical and Physical
Contradictions. Why &#8220;Trade-off&#8221;, why &#8220;Inherited contradiction&#8221;? Especially when
the author himself uses the old terms as synonyms later in his book. </p>
<p>The author also mixes the contradiction concept with that of system. He
writes: &#8220;A contradiction is a conflict in the system&#8221;. Further the author names
the &#8220;tool and object&#8221; in the &#8220;trade-offs&#8221;. Is there a need or request for
simplification to talk about &#8220;tool and object&#8221; in this context? </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>A contradiction appears simply in the product characteristics, not in the
    system. See [1] pp.89 -91. Consider the fact that the solution of Technical
    Contradiction is found in the Matrix of <u>product characteristics</u>. How
    do these &#8220;tool&#8221; and &#8220;object&#8221; contribute to the contradiction? I didn&#8217;t find
    any answer.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</i>
<p>The author describes in fact the Substance-Field Analysis elements, now
renamed &#8220;contradiction&#8221; or &#8220;trade-off&#8221;. The author further confuses the reader
by speaking with everyday terms, tool as an axe, and soon after as TRIZ
(Substance-Field) term. There is no explanations whatever of the difference. How
enlightening!</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t the concept of tool and object be used and reserved for the
Substance-Field Analysis only? Now a newcomer is again in the centre of a mess.
<i>Later in the book the author again describes contradictions between tool and
object in the case of Su-Fi analysis.</i> Isn&#8217;t it simply a problem in the
system, which could and should be solved by Substance Field Analysis and
&#8220;Standards&#8221;? See e.g. much better definitions by Savransky [2] pp 60-61. Now the
&#8220;pearl&#8221; of TRIZ is presented as a side step in three pages with no mention what
so ever of &#8220;Standards&#8221;. Fortunately the reference by Salamatov [3] uses some 200
pages to clarify the approach, not to mention &#8220;Tools of Classical TRIZ [4].</p>
<p>The author also mixes the concepts of Macro and Micro level with that of
Super and Sub level. These concepts are totally different things. See Altshuller
[5]. </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>The author should have been precise or understood the difference to avoid
    additional confusions like this.</i> </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>Further the &#8220;Simplified TRIZ&#8221; goes to the presentation of &#8220;Principal
Resource&#8221;. What is that? Isn&#8217;t it simply the Object? What about the &#8220;Auxiliary
Resources&#8221;? Aren&#8217;t these simply a part of Substance Field Resource Analysis? </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>What additional benefits do these terms bring with? The answer is nil.</p>
    <p>These new terms do nothing but cause additional mess. There is no actual
    use or benefit of these &#8220;new&#8221; definitions. </p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>
<b>
<p>Examples with wrong explanations</p>
</b>
<p>There are additional wrong concepts or simply misinterpretations. The author
seems to think that a void is the same as &#8220;micro&#8221; level. In the Fiskars axe
example the author describes the &#8220;micro level&#8221; of making the handle hollow. To
be precise, this example is a &#8220;Level one&#8221; invention according to Altshuller[5].
There is a simple technical task to replace a wooden handle with one made of
glass reinforced plastics (or equivalent). Since the latter is much more durable
than wood, you don&#8217;t need such a diameter as in the case of wooden handle.
However the GRP has at least twice as much specific weight than that of wood. If
the handle is solid GRP it becomes too heavy etc. What is an ideal handle? If
you are playing and enjoying golf, you&#8217;ll know that a shaft weighting nothing,
is the ideal one. There are no &#8220;micro level&#8221; whatever explanations but simple
engineering understanding of moment of inertia. This would have been a more
&#8220;scientific&#8221; approach and explanation. Further it is obvious that the author
doesn&#8217;t understand the difference between energy and power.</p>
<i>
<p>Had the author known his mechanics he had avoided these fallacies. </p>
</i>
<p>The same continues in the lawnmower muffler example. Had the author known the
principles of sound absorption, he had described the whole situation as in the
actual case: the invention was based to the need to find another &#8220;muffler&#8221; to
replace that broken. What are the basic &#8220;tricks&#8221; in a muffler design?
&#8220;Everybody&#8221; knows how to dampen the combustion engine noise but the author. </p>
<i>
<p>Had the author described the functions of muffler, he would have known what
to search for?</p>
</i>
<p>The same inexperience in engineering and lack of knowledge in manufacturing
continues with the example of the visor latching. The proposed solution will not
simply work. Why? Consider the actual conditions in the use and the
manufacturing tolerances. The conditions might be e.g. such while in harbour the
port side of the visor is in the bright sunshine, the starboard in the shadow.
The temperature difference might be several tens of degrees, while the
dimensions of the visor are tens of meters. Calculate or simply give a thought
how much distortion this might cause? Further the visor is a very large piece of
ship, preferably manufactured in advance with all latches etc., ready installed.
<i>This is the common advanced practice in shipbuilding today.</i> How can you
manufacture such a part with the latches &#8220;dead sharp&#8221; or how can you be sure
these dimensions will last? The answer is you can&#8217;t. The fact that the patentee
had acquired a patent for the conical pin doesn&#8217;t prove anything about the
suitability of such an innovation in practice. Why just the angle 15.4 degrees?
What is the (&#8220;scientific&#8221;) explanation of that? Anybody else with some
engineering and manufacturing experience would most likely have rejected the
patent as an example. Everybody can draw a picture of that design and find it
will not work as described. </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>A thoughtful and experienced engineer or naval architect finds these
    kinds of examples naive and frustrating. The reader will simply omit TRIZ.
    Thus these examples are only harming the acceptance of TRIZ.</p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>In some examples it is obvious that the author doesn&#8217;t understand cost or
investment. This is the case particularly in the &#8220;Thinning out&#8221; of carrot seeds.
Let alone the author will use the 40 principles as an independent source of
solutions versus the correct use of Matrix. What have been the correct Technical
Contradictions? What are the suitable or recommended Principles from the Matrix?
What is the correct definition of Physical Contradiction (is it the one
presented)? What about the thinning out or removal of weeds? Had the author any
experience in allotment gardening he had understood the example correctly.</p>
<p>There is additionally some naive and frustrating advice to find a solution to
problem. One should analyse all the resources in the system &amp; environment. Wait
a moment! The list will be enormous! Sure, the answer is there, isn&#8217;t all the
human knowledge there? The &#8220;HOW&#8221; is missing!</p>
<b>
<p>Some peculiarities</p>
</b>
<p>In the book there are many attempts to explain the &#8220;What&#8221;. What should be
done or found. The &#8220;What&#8221; is of course important, but the &#8221;HOW&#8221; would have been
the most important of all. This is laid down. No actual &#8220;How&#8221;s are explained.
The author tries to explain the end result with the help of <i>a priori</i>
knowledge of the solution. This is, however, not very innovative nor explaining.
Further it would have been more rewarding with recent innovations than
explaining very ancient examples. The most aged of the examples date some 50 to
60 years ago. The authors explain this hypocritically with the confidentiality
of their projects. </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>Wouldn&#8217;t it have been more honest to leave this kind of &#8220;confidentiality&#8221;
    statements out and use the examples as they are, just a collection from
    scientific papers or technical newsletters?</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</i>
<p>If however the authors have been working over two decades with TRIZ, why
can&#8217;t they present any innovation of their own some 5 to 10 years of age? These
would of course be well known for the competitors by now and thus of any harm to
the client. </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>Now the reader has been given the illusion of highly competent author
    with a lot of projects, which unfortunately are not allowed to publish.
    Would you believe?</p>
    </i>
    <p>All the examples are <i>a posteriori</i> or simply retrospective examples
    <i>what could or would have been done with TRIZ if the inventor had had any
    knowledge of TRIZ (if they in general are suitable as examples).</p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>Some other peculiarities in the text: in the Job Plan part the author claims
that the problem statement is not important at all. However later in the text
that is again very important? </p>
<p>The author pinpoints that the importance of features (and not the functions).
Features are of course easy to describe but functions are much more important
for the results. Altshuller himself already emphasized this. The function
concept is a major part of the method. </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>The author has no deep understanding in Value Analysis. Hence the
    &#8220;features&#8221;. To &#8220;simplify&#8221; TRIZ this way is again a major flaw.</p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>&#8220;When the velocity of car increases, safety worsens.&#8221; &#8220;Long distance
communication technology first expanded- telegraph and telephone wires- and then
trimmed - wireless technology.&#8221; How come? These kind of ridiculous and faulty
definitions or misinterpretations the book is full of. (I thought the safety
depends mainly on the driver, does it not? What about the wireless technology?
Is it the result of trimming?)</p>
<p>The above examples are but a few of careless or false statements which the
book is loaded. A careful proofreading by somebody familiar with techniques
would have been an asset.</p>
<p>Something good: </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>t<i>he book is at its best when giving the explanations to 40 principles
    loaned from other TRIZniks. The outlook is also O.K. Some citations from
    Homer will probably excite somebody.</p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>
<b>
<p>The &#8220;scientific approach&#8221;</p>
</b>
<p>The author claims that the book represents a &#8220;scientific&#8221; approach. I would
say it doesn&#8217;t. See the comments above. The same applies to &#8220;cognitive&#8221;
learning. It appears that the author has found a fancy term and tries to give a
&#8220;scientific&#8221; impression. The result is more likely something to do with
&#8220;scientology&#8221;. A book is not simply &#8220;scientific&#8221; nor &#8220;cognitive&#8221; on the sole
bases that the author says so, the reader have to be convinced about that. The
frequent repetition of the previous examples in the text is nothing but boring,
not at all cognitive experience, only yawning. This was supposed to be an
introduction of TRIZ to adult readers?</p>
<p>The author even loses good taste and goes even further to praise himself: </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i>
    <p>&#8220;The model presented in this book is based on modern TRIZ, on recent
    achievements of innovative design in industry and on the latest results&#8221;</i>.
    And a few pages later: <i>&#8220;&#8230;on the feedback from many students of TRIZ over
    the past two decades&#8221;. </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</i>
<p>For the sake of precision I would like to ask: </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <u><i>
    <p>Which achievements, which research and by whom? These are faulty
    statements without any proof and made only to praise the book by the author
    himself. These kinds of statements might perhaps be accepted in the spoken
    sales talk, but certainly not in a book.</p>
    <p>The reader would like to have references. Without them these kinds of
    statements are simply intentionally misleading and even impostorous?</p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>
</u>
<p>There is an unwritten consent that everything new in TRIZ is and has to be
tested in numerous cases with positive results. Where are the cases? How many
are they? Who has verified these? The questions about TRIZ are more than
justified? [6].</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <i><b>
    <p>The more you read the book the more you&#8217;ll find similar confusing
    explanations, paradoxes and misinterpretations without any real show how.</p>
    </b></i>
  </dir>
</dir>
<b>
<p>The latter part</p>
</b>
<p>The latter part of the book is beyond my experience ( QFD, Robust Design, DFM-A,
Concurrent Engineering?, TOC, SIX Sigma). This part of the book is actually not
needed or relevant. Or is it to acquire readers from the experts of these topics
only? I sincerely hope that these have been explained more correctly.</p>
<b>
<p>Conclusion</p>
</b><i>
<p>I don&#8217;t simply understand the praise of this book in the review. Maybe Dr.
Slocum and Ms. Lundberg have simply botched their critiques?</p>
<b>
<p>I cannot recommend this book to any reader.</p>
