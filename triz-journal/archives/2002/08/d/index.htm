<p>Abstract</p>
</b>
<p>The 40 Inventive Principles of classical TRIZ are useful creativity tools in
a variety of problem solving situations. On the other hand, they are often
criticised for being too abstract, for their often illogical sequencing, their
level of overlap, for the gaps that they contain and, most of all, for the
difficulty most people experience trying to remember them all.</p>
<p>The article describes an ongoing piece of research aimed at not only
overcoming these issues, but also trying to improve the richness of the
Principles. In defining a revised Inventive Principle structure that is both
richer and easier to remember, a contradiction has had to be solved. The article
describes the resolution of this contradiction. It describes how the richness of
the Principles has been increased through the integration of
contradiction-breaking strategies from outside TRIZ (namely the Osborn
�SCAMMPERR� and WOIS models), and how the ability to remember the Principles has
been influenced by psychological work on the mechanics of the human mind -
namely that we have a short term memory capable of remembering no more than nine
things at a time.</p>
<p>Applying TRIZ trends to the Inventive Principles strongly suggests the
benefits of using Principles in combination. Looking further forward, the
article shows how the re-structured Principles facilitate greater ease of use
during problem solving situations in which it is helpful to utilise more than
one Principle at a time. </p>

<font SIZE="1"></font><b>
<p>Some Principles Are Stronger Than Others</p>
</b>
<p>Any regular user of the Inventive Principles will have experienced the fact
that some Principles tend to give results that are more powerful than others. In
this sense, it appears that some of the Principles work at a higher level than
others. Based on the experience of this author, the higher level Principles are
closely related to the philosophical pillars of TRIZ described in Reference 1
and reproduced in Figure 1.</p>

</b></font>
<p>In particular, it was noted that two Principles - 25 Self-Service and 22
Blessing in Disguise very specifically related to the Ideality and Resources
pillars respectively. The connection between �self� and the Ideal Final Result
element of the ideality concept has previously been made in Reference 2
alongside the recognition that the Self-Service Principle does not feature very
often in the classic Contradiction Matrix. Similarly, the Blessing in Disguise
Principle is featured only infrequently in the Matrix. This despite the fact
that the definition of a resource within TRIZ very definitely encourages users
to consider that even the things that are currently thought of as �bad� can be
transformed into something useful. One of the things meant by �higher level�
here in fact is that they are Principles that should be considered all the time,
and not just when the Matrix suggests they be used.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As described in Reference 3, when examining the SCAMMPERR
model in more detail (for those that don�t know, the letters that make up the
acronym are <b>S</b>ubstitute, <b>C</b>ombine, <b>A</b>dapt, <b>M</b>agnify, <b>
M</b>odify, <b>P</b>ut-to-another-use, <b>E</b>liminate, <b>R</b>e-arrange and
<b>R</b>everse), we found that while 8 of the 9 strategies in the model were
covered by the Inventive Principles and by the 5x3 matrix framework above, the
�P� - �put to another use� was not. In SCAMMPERR, this trigger encourages users
to solve problems by changing function. This is not normal TRIZ practice, but,
again, when we asked the question �would it be possible to challenge a
contradiction by changing function, the answer was an unqualified �yes�. For
example, here is a quote from Reference 4:</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font><i>
<p>�Not long ago, Pfizer invested considerable energy and resources in a drug
for treating hypertension. Tests indicated that its effects in hypertension were
not all we had anticipated. This disappointment was offset by tests indicating
that it would prove a much better treatment for arrhythmia - irregular heartbeat
- than any other available medication. Another medicine, which was slated to
treat anxiety, seems to be a very effective headache remedy.�</p>
<p>�On another occasion, our researchers were dissatisfied with the performance
of a new medication we had developed to treat angina; it failed to alleviate
angina�s paroxysmal chest pains. Serendipity intervened, however, and defeat
emerged as opportunity. By chance we discovered the medication�s extraordinary
side effect: It restores sexual vigor to the impotent. The US market for such a
drug is significant. Impotence afflicts some 20 million men in this country
alone.�</p>
</i><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also noted that the �change function� means of
resolving a contradiction is also a feature of some of the �additional�
Inventive Principles included in the WOIS methodology (Reference 5).</p>
<font SIZE="1"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taken together with the above Principles 22 and 25, we
believe this �change function� Principle forms a useful third entry in a trio of
special Principles linked directly to the five philosophical strands of TRIZ -
as illustrated in Figure 2.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 2: Higher Level Pillar-Related Inventive Principles</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again as reported in Reference 3, the space-time-interface
dimensional thinking pillar acted as an important start point for rethinking the
structure of the remaining Principles. Many users, for example, will have
noticed how some of the Principles can be related to all three dimensions -
Segmentation for example can be applied as a contradiction breaking strategy
with respect to physical segmentation, segmentation of time (see also �Periodic
Action�) and segmentation of the interfaces between things. It was also noted
that some Principles had analogues that reversed the Principle - e.g.
�Segmentation� and �Merging� are often interpreted as two opposites. On the
other hand, some didn�t - Asymmetry being one such example. When asking the
question �would it be possible to challenge a contradiction by making something
symmetrical instead of asymmetrical, we again answered with a definitive yes.
The opposite can also occur, balance and proportion then becoming important
factors. The same happened with many other Principles.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Later on while looking at the space-time-and interface
entities it was observed that within each category, all of the Principles
grouped into just five different strategies for modifying a system :-</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>segment or merge (i.e. change the number of entities)</li>
  <li>make the entities bigger or smaller</li>
  <li>change the external geometry</li>
  <li>change the internal structure</li>
  <li>substitute the existing structure for something else.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was then found that the existing Principles fitted very neatly into a 5x3
matrix as illustrated below:-</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="03.gif" width="500" height="308"></p>
</font><font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 3: 5x3 Matrix of Remaining Inventive Principles</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="1"></font>
<p>Each box in the Matrix is split into two halves - a yellow triangle
representing the usually positive interpretation of a given strategy, and a blue
triangle representing the opposite interpretation (for example segmentation in
the top left corner has a segment (yellow) interpretation and a merge (blue)
interpretation).</p>
<p>In showing how the matrix of Principles can be interpreted in each of the
space, time and interface categories, Figure 4 provides a visual representation
of basic images and how the five different (number, size, external shape,
internal structure, substitute) modification strategies affect those basic
images.</p>
<p>The basic idea behind the revised means of structuring the Principles is that
although it is easier to remember (basically just the five modification
strategies plus space, time and interface interpretations at the highest level),
it actually contains a degree of richness greater than the original 40
Principles. For example, most users tend to naturally interpret the �Asymmetry�
Principle in the context of a physical entity. What the �re-shape� modification
prompt is intended to provide is the image that �asymmetry� can equally well
also be applied in both time and interface contexts - as illustrated in the
Figure.</p>

</font><font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 4: Visual Interpretation of the 5x3 Matrix Elements for
Space, Time and Interface Categories</p>
</b></font>
<p>Taken together, then, with the previously identified �higher level�
Principles, gives the comprehensive Inventive Principle map illustrated in
Figure 5.</p>

<b>
<p>Future Work</p>
</b>
<p>The initial experience of this author is that the revised Principle structure
gives a significantly richer structure with which to solve contradiction related
problems. Undoubtedly, the revised structure is still in a process of iteration
- with, for example, ongoing tasks to show how the Principle sub-categories also
fit into the overall structure (Principle 35A through E fitting into several
different boxes in the 5x3 matrix) and to more explicitly incorporate some of
the WOIS and other �missing� inventive strategies - e.g. the �use of reducing
agents� analogue to Principle 38 described in Reference 6.</p>
<p>More importantly, it is also emerging that the revised structure can be
connected to the Contradiction Matrix of classical TRIZ, the physical
contradiction separation strategies and the more effective use of Principles in
combination with one another. This work - including a new Contradiction Matrix
based on the revised Principle structure - will be published in Reference 7.</p>
