<p>Abstract</p>
</b>
<p>In this paper, I explore the nature of contradiction and
analogy as a basis for inventive thinking. In doing so, I find that
contradiction is not only a primary constituent of <b>TRIZ</b>, but fundamental
to creating scale, perspective and orientation -that is all the �dimensions�
perceived in our mathematics, neurophysiology and, indeed, the physical world.
Contradiction is likewise fundamental to the process of determining analogy -or
creating fields of relationship, in technical innovation. Both analogy and
contradiction are most easily represented by relating elements in a triangle,
reminiscent of the relationships created in Su-field models. There may be many
nested levels of triangular relationship required to describe an integrated
system, sub- and super- system during its evolution from past to future. Both
the presence of analogy and resolution of contradiction force us to identify the
system level within which we function, and from which we must<b> </b>remove
ourselves to apply a domain-specific idea at another level, or in another
context. On the basis of both mathematics and intuition, contradiction is
intrinsic to multi-dimensional, analogic and inventive thinking.</p>
<b>
<p>Introduction</p>

</b>
<p>In Western science, the formative years of our training are
traditionally based on Newtonian abstraction. The methods we are taught do not
make us comfortable with relating to, or resolving, contradictory information or
modes of thought. They teach us, instead, to screen out one of the options. They
force us to eradicate apparently extraneous data and opinion, in the interests
of over-simplicity, predictability and economic or temporal efficiency, just as
soon as they seem irrelevant to our original aim. </p>
<p>The fact is, however, that in this way, we often throw our
proverbial baby out with the claw-footed bath. First, because abstracted
thinking is inappropriate for dealing with a natural world of chaotic, dynamic
and complex behaviours. Second, because, as modern psychologists Howard Gardner
[1, 2] and Bernice McCarthy [3, 4] point out, the acknowledgement of
contradictory information is an important part of the rational learning process,
the creative process and the evolution of integrated intelligence. </p>
<b>
<p>TRIZ</b> has become a highly popular aid for creating
innovative technologies in the West. Compared with other �thinking systems� used
commercially, it delivers considerably more complex tools and information. It
also allows for both rational and intuitive thought. The fact that it does so
successfully is likely due to an internal simplicity -the suite of <b>TRIZ</b>
tools is permeated by two outstanding features: </p>
    <font COLOR="#008000">
    </p><ol>
      <li>The supposition that recognizing and resolving
    �contradiction� is intrinsic to problem-solving</li>
      <li>The application of analogy. </li>
</ol>
    </font>
<p>In this paper, we will explore how these two factors are
intimately related and may fundamentally underlie both our perception of the
existing world and our creative construction of new ones. There are three main
questions we will address:</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff">
    </p><ol>
      <li>What <i>are </i>contradiction and analogy? </li>
      <li>How do we find perspective and depth by resolving
    contradiction and seeing analogy? </li>
      <li>And how do we use contradiction and analogy to
    identify and exploit multiple dimensions or levels of solution within a
    super-system? </li>
</ol>
    </font>
<b>
<p>Contradiction</p>
</b>
<p>The Oxford and Macquarie dictionaries [5, 6] define
contradiction as, �a lack of agreement between facts, opinions, actions etc.�
From Roget�s Thesaurus [7], we can also add the synonyms; �being contrary; a
contrast, dissent, discordance, difference, diversity, discrepancy,
incompatibility, opposite, antithesis.�</p>
<p>That said, what absolutely constitutes contradiction is, of
course, a matter of opinion. </p>
<p>The lack of agreement between observers/observations is
totally a function of their respective starting positions (both conceptual
axioms and assumptions or physical position and orientation) with respect to the
object of interest. The discrepancies in their data are likely scale-dependent.
Dissent may exist only in the reference frame within which one or other observer
primarily operates -for we can certainly find a relationship of elements within
contradiction, which simultaneously separates and unites concepts. And we can
sanely redefine our starting points, to find that the contradictions were only
apparent, and not �real� - i.e. a paradox. </p>
<b>
<p>TRIZ</b> defines two types of contradiction -technical and
physical. The first (eg. desiring both A + B) can be considered �conceptual� or
�apparent�, and is presumed to be resolvable, by considering the problem from
outside the existing system (using one of the given tools). The second (eg.
desiring A + not A) is usually considered absolutely �real� or �actual�, and
unable to ever be resolved. Of course, in the terms just discussed, this may
also not be true. The definition of contradiction as �antithesis� will allow us
to get rid of personal opinions as to what contradiction might be.</p>
<p>In any case, as Nikolay Shpakovsky [8] also pointed out, we
can see the resolution of antitheses very clearly and simply in a triangle
(Figure 1), where two extreme positions during the problem-solving process are
ultimately united in a third position -the final or ideal result (IFR). At the
apex of the diagram, the distinct situational levels of object, concept and
abstraction are merged. Along the way to resolution, there is some conceptual
�to-ing and fro-ing� between endpoints, over the central axis, creating a kind
of �Christmas tree� effect. And, of course, the process of resolving
discrepancies may stop before reaching the ideal endpoint. However, that will
not change the shape of the relationship -merely leave us in a �nested� tree, or
sub-system level solution, a situation to be further explored below.</p>
<b>
<p>Analogy</p>
</b>
<b>
<p>TRIZ</b> presupposes that, �whatever your problem is, someone, somewhere, has
already solved it�, and that we can draw on the experience of others and a
database of solutions approximately, if not exactly, the same as our own,
through analogously applying the 40 Principles of Invention to our problem
system.</p>

    axis is degree of abstraction of the situation. Vertical axis is ideality of
    solution concepts. Points along this axis correspond to situations in which
    contradiction appears to exist, because concept and physical object levels
    are mixed. The problem-solving process involves many transitions between
    expert competence with object knowledge, and specialist competence with
    abstract knowledge.</p>
    </blockquote>
    </i>
<p>Analogy is recognized as perhaps one of the most important teaching methods,
especially where some linguistic difference exists between speaker and listener.
As a symbolic representation, it is natural to many cultures, important as a
means of popularizing or guiding complex, abstract concepts. It creates a
shortcut or �fast-track� to comprehension, as it offers the advantage of drawing
on some pre-existing capacity to see similarities and differences, rather than
assuming a lengthy education is necessary. It may have a central role underlying
the architecture of all thought<i> </i>[9]. </p>
<p>The world�s great scientists have recognized analogy as being important in
their research and variously labelled it as: a useful story, hypothesis,
assumption, model, theory, standard, proof, reference frame or framework [10].
The Collins and Macquarie dictionaries describe analogy as a �plan, blueprint,
template, definition, concept, representation� [<i>ibid</i>]. The Encyclopaedia
of World Problems and Human Potential adds to this list with; allegory,
synecdoche, metonymy, parable, symbol [11].</p>
<p>In short, the modern Western world regards analogy as an abstraction; a vague
aesthetic, linguistic, symbolic, visual or mechanistic approximation. It
supposes analogy is a �state of being something�, occurring at a single point in
spacetime. It demands analogy to be a singular event, mental state or
observation, even though this greatly limits its usefulness (please see Appendix
for further information). </p>
<p>In the strictest sense however, analogy is not any of these things. </p>
<p>Analogy is a mathematical relationship, responsible for the repetition of
individual and group elements in natural and artificially produced systems. It
is the means whereby music, art and architecture achieve their precision and
complexity. Related to stereology and also known as projective geometry, it is
classically a technique whereby all conceivable 2D and 3D geometries can be
compared at a single scale of observation: <i>actually</i> distorted in 2D, in
order to be <i>apparently</i> preserved. </p>
<p>Classically, according to the ancient Greek philosophers, analogy does not
just �exist�. It is formed. Analogy is a <i>process</i>, achieved via a certain
sequence of steps [12]. </p>
<p>These are: </p>
<font COLOR="#0000ff">
<p>1/. Scale or <i>Ratio</i>: the measure of differentness; a comparison of two
sizes, quantities, qualities or ideas, expressed by the formula for division,
a:b. </p>
<p>2/. <i>Proportion</i>: the determination of sameness; which can be</p>
        <i>
        <dl>
          <dd>discontinuous</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the relationship of equivalence between four terms
        in two ratios a:b :: c:d</dd>
        <i>
          <dd>continuous</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the relationship of equivalence between three terms in
        two ratios a:b :: b:c</dd>
        <i>
          <dd>golden</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the reduction of a three term proportion to two, a:b ::
        b:(a+b)</dd>
</dl>
        </font>
<p>The final proportion requires the largest term to be a wholeness or unit,
composed of the other two terms -ie. a repetition of pattern involving at least
two scales. It should be obvious that growth is here achieved simultaneously by
addition, multiplication and division, in a sequence or series.</p>
<p>Two interesting correspondences are implicit in the classical
process of analogy, which are potentially important for our understanding of its
function in <b>TRIZ</b> and inventive thinking in general. </p>
<p>These are:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>When we create a ratio, we are comparing or
        examining differences of entities assumed to be largely the same. That
        is, we are comparing magnitude, though not identity. Then, determining
        �differentness� can be made more exacting through determining �sameness�
        - that is, by reducing the number of variables in the equation. The
        process thus first requires objects to exist as isolated entities in
        their own, local, frames of reference, somewhere apart from a hidden
        observer, who is also in her own local frame of reference. Then it
        requires that all reference frames, including that of the observer, be
        related to each other. In other words, as the steps of analogy are
        followed and resolution is increased, the observer both becomes explicit
        and is built into the system. <b>In the final, continuous and golden
        steps, where we are using the fewest terms or objects for comparison, it
        is the perceiver herself, <i>b</i>, who consciously integrates or forms
        the equivalence and identity between the observed differences</b>. That
        means all previous mismatches, discrepancies or apparent contradictions
        in our thinking should have been resolved at this stage.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The whole process of establishing analogy is
        fractal or scale-independent, since the reference frame is complete at
        each stage yet is simultaneously additive, multiplicative and divisive,
        as new elements are introduced and made consistent with the primary
        observation. At all points in the process of creating analogy, the
        system involves more than one scale. The penultimate system includes all
        scales. In other words, there are hidden �dimensions� and related system
        levels at every stage of both time and space. This concept can perhaps
        be further exploited in the context of <b>TRIZ</b> �system operator� or
        �9-windows� [13]. We must assume that there are hidden but related
        systems in our problems, at every stage, even when we cannot immediately
        see them. </li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, classical analogic thinking is creeping into
the modern study of chaos and complexity. Creations like �Pseudo Phase Space�,
for instance, involve only one variable changing in time [14]. First, new
variables are created by comparing the original identity with a time-lagged
identity and then both starting and finishing points are tracked as they create
sets, (sub)series or sequences of ratios. eg. xt: xt+1, xt: xt+2, xt: xt+w�
Similarly, there exist Non-integer or Exponent -so-called �Fractal Dimensions�,
which relate the number of increments needed to measure an object, to its
evolution. The variables are thus directly proportional to the size of the scale
or measurement tool and come close to including the observer in the system [15].

    contradiction of the situation. Vertical axis is ideality of solution
    concepts. Points along this axis correspond to situations in which
    contradiction is resolved, as if the result were final or ideal. It is
    however, possible to achieve ever-increasing levels of resolution, hence we
    can identify or track relative subsystem, system and supersystem levels.
    Again, the problem-solving process involves many transitions back and forth
    between concepts or parameters, considering fully first one side of the
    argument, then the next.</p>
    </blockquote>
    </i>
<p>Again, we can illustrate these concepts of analogy very
clearly and simply in a series of nested triangles (Figure 2), of intermediate
solutions (labelled relatively as subsystem, system, supersystem), where two
extreme positions are ultimately united in an ideal situation -the IFR. Note
that the axis of ideality is also an axis of time. In contrast to Shpakovsky�s
model, contradiction does not exist as a point in space, but as a line between
conflicting parameters. Accepting that contradiction is therefore our very
journey back and forth, we can be, in this case, perhaps more fully engaged with
the process of resolution than when we start from the divisive standpoint in
which contradiction exists as a static entity. Necessarily, before resolution,
there may still be some conceptual �to-ing and fro-ing� and different levels of
solution which are not ideal (although often, in some sense, final).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Perspective and depth </p>
</b>
<p>A similar model of triangular relationship is necessary to
understand depth and perspective.</p>
<p>Neurophysiologically and mathematically, it turns out that <i>
depth</i> is an attempt to symmetrically resolve a mismatch of 2D information.
It is not always necessarily a measure of �real� or physical space. </p>
<p>We have, for instance, two eyes, rather than one cyclopian
one, so that slightly different orientations of an object are presented to each
eye [16]. As the brain tries to find a relationship between them, we interpret
their difference as a third spatial dimension or depth (Figure 3a).<b> </p>
</b>
<p>Now, in the ideal situation, where an object is located at
the centre line of vision, we would say that depth of data is the common side of
two identical, symmetric triangles sharing a common, primary reference frame.
The situation gets trickier when we move off the centre line, for that
introduces at least two more (local or non-primary) frames of reference (one for
each eye), which are either slightly rotated or at different scales, with
respect to each other (Figure 3b). In other words, the system evolves, each time
an element moves� we get a new set of contradictions and triangles and <i>quasi
</i>Su-field relationships*.</p>
<p>Objects located off the centre line of our binocular vision
always have one object-to-eye path, which is slightly shorter than the other and
which will take less time to complete [17, 18, 19]. And there are two ways in
which we can resolve the discrepancy in object-to-eye distance:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>(I) If we preserve symmetry, there are two possible
      positions for the object to occupy; O1 and O2, which create the same total
      discrepancy in object-to-eye distance and whereby the angles of rotation
      will cancel out. This will create four local frames of reference. </p>
      <p>(II) If we account for scale, there is a single
      reference frame on one of the object positions, which can harmonize the
      discrepant angles via two similar triangles: RF1B and RF2B sharing a
      common side.</p>
    </blockquote>
<p>We exploit this phenomenon in modern computer graphics, by
encoding left-eye and right-eye images on alternate fields, and juxtaposing
these temporally on our monitors. The faster this happens, the easier it is to
sustain an image, so the fastest machines today change image direction
approximately 120 times per second.</p>
<p>Ears, analogously, find �timbre� and �beat frequencies� in
music, via superposition of dissimilar sound waves received in stereo [20].
Depth, in other words, can result from temporal mismatches as well as spatial
ones.</p>
<p>We can also presume that the ability to find depth, or
additional meaningfully related information, in a given philosophy or theory
(such as <b>TRIZ</b>) follows the same rules. Deep understanding of a subject
usually follows from resolving apparently conflicting information and finding a
relationship between elements that creates some useful analogy. </p>

  </i>
  <b>
  <p>Perspective</p>
  </b>
<p>The ability to see a given subject from different points of
view is linguistically referred to as �<i>having perspective�</i>. In both
engineering and daily life, we know that being able to view a problematic engine
or tactical dilemma from various angles often leads to unique insights and
solutions.</p>
<p>We can treat this issue as a corollary or extension of depth.
</p>
<p>It was the great painters of the Renaissance, who developed
the system of �focused perspective�, which depicted objects as they appeared to
the eye. Their discovery heralded a significant departure from the traditionally
�flat� art and thinking of the Middle and Dark Ages.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle of perspective is the projection of
multi-dimensional objects onto a lower-dimensional -usually 2D plane, through a
given focus. It visually preserves all angular relationships of elements within
the original <i>n</i>D object, though usually this necessitates an actual
distortion of shape on the (<i>n-1 </i>D) page, in order for the visual effect
to remain true [21, 22] In chaos theory, we say that the different viewpoints
remain topologically equivalent. But this means the visual geometry requires
that volumes shrink with distance and parallel lines converge to a vanishing
point on the horizon. This simplest example of this principle is parallel
railway lines converging to a point (Figure 4a).</p>
<p>A slightly more complex example in which distortion of a shape conserves
visual geometry is Leon Batista Alberti�s (c1440) outline of the general method
to represent horizontal squares in a vertical picture plane as trapezoids [23]
(Figure 4b). </p>

<p>Let the eye be at a station point, <b>S</b>, that is <i>h</i> units above the
ground plane and <i>k</i> units in front of the picture plane. The intersection
of the ground plane and the picture plane is called the ground-line; the foot,
<b>V</b>, of the perpendicular from <b>S</b> to the picture plane is called the
centre of vision or vanishing point; the line through <b>V</b> parallel to the

of squares in the ground plane.</p>
<p>Perspective requires increasingly sophisticated methods of
geometrical analysis, involving not only straight lines, but conics. It means we
coincidentally apply the principle of scale in order to depict object
orientation and depth accurately. </p>
<p>In the <b>TRIZ</b> framework, we might say that once we have
established how a problem or object, with its local reference frame, sits in our
primary reference frame, ie. in relation to ourselves, the observer at the
origin, then we can then rotate, translate or otherwise move it (or ourselves)
and look at it from different angles - introducing <i>perspective</i>. True, we
must temporarily separate ourselves from our conceptual or physical starting
point and move to another point of view, or to the object itself to do this (at
which point we can use the �Smart Little People� tool) and so, in many cases,
create an apparent contradiction. However, as long as we remember to relate the
multiple reference frames, via a strict set of angular proportions, we can turn
the contradiction into analogy.</p>
<b>
<p>How do we use contradiction and analogy to identify and
exploit multiple dimensions or levels of solution within a super-system? </p>

</b>
<p>In the same way that mathematical or visual depth is created
by juxtaposing opposing or angled points of view, the most refined methods of
facilitating problem-solving attempt to lead the thinker through different
angles of approach, to create psychological depth or insight. </p>
<p>Essentially, what contradiction implies, is that there is
more than one reference frame or worldview in the equation. It implies that
there is multi-dimensional, analogic or �9-windows� information available to us,
and not that there is actually a flaw in the system.</p>
<p>When contradiction is apparent, we are being called upon to
identify the boundaries of our existing reference frame and move outside it. We
are being asked to identify a geometric relationship and integrate the scale and
perspective of our starting point, with the scale and orientation of our desired
finishing point, so as to resolve the mismatch. </p>
<p>In essence, I am proposing that �multi-dimensional�,
�systems-� or inventive thinking is a process of resolving contradiction, to
create a field of analogical, and hence triangulated, information. And, what is
important in exploiting multiple levels of solution, is assuming a ubiquity of
triangular relationship in nature and understanding their properties.</p>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#ff0000">
</font>
<p>As problem-solvers, TRIZ allows us to add arbitrary elements
and fields or dimensions, or remove them from the system, to enhance, decrease
or remove undesired effects. We can do this in time or space and each time we
do, the manipulation can be represented in a triangular relation. </p>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#993300">
</font>
<p>Of course, mathematically we know that, because it can
maintain both links and separation between opposites, the triangle is the most
stable relationship for three elements. </p>
<p>More technically, it has no degrees of freedom. The triangle
is totally deterministic, so a change in any one part will necessarily engender
a change elsewhere in the triangle. Thus we can be sure of a result. If there is
no obvious result, then we don�t have a triangle (though the converse isn�t
true). By corollary, if we want to make a change in one part of a system without
affecting another part, which might be vulnerable, we need at least 4 components
-introducing a second level of triangulation.</p>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#ff0000">
</font>
<p>It is well known that triangulation is the basic method of surveying, and
that any topological problem can be broken down into a series of triangular
relationships. Triangulation provides a �short-cut�, in that we can afford to
ignore whole sets of data when we do our analysis, especially since we are
projecting the problem onto 2D. The same method is used in computer-aided
visualization of 3D surfaces and volumes [27]. Gross triangulations are made
smoother by continually decreasing scale of triangulation. We can create a
complete picture of our physical world in this way.</p>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#993300">
</font>
<p>We could create a similar map of the changes in our
psychological orientation and perspective during the process of problem-solving.
A good artist could perhaps even apply the rules of scale and focussed
perspective to the elements of this map, linking the original problem and
coincident �primary� triangulated reference frame of the observer, to all
successive reference frames built onto it. At the conclusion, we would have
quite a complex and certainly multi-dimensional representation of our solution
on the page. Of course, in the Western tradition, we generally try to represent
our problem in the simplest possible manner, so we never make pictures like this
and it perhaps not obvious how multi-dimensional our thinking has been. However,
as we resolve apparent contradiction of parameters via a process of analogy, we
are always employing multi-dimensional thinking, whether we can see it or not.</p>
<p>In classical <b>TRIZ</b>, it is also known that the simplest
model of a well-functioning technical system is the triangle, even though one of
the elements (usually the field) may become hidden or �invisible� when the
desired effect is achieved. Triangulation can be exploited in Su-field analysis*
and we might assume that contradiction is most easily resolvable when this tool
is employed. Of course that is not exactly the case. However, with the existence
of Su-field analysis, we can see that there is self-consistency within our
toolbox; the concept of contradiction is not separate from the tools we use to
resolve external contradictions, but intrinsic to them. In terms of this paper,
we can say that the triangular relation is necessarily a <b>TRIZ</b> principle
or Su-field principle because it is necessarily fundamental to the process of
analogy. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
</b>
<p>In our daily lives and in technological innovation, we are
often asked to deal with contradictions that Western scientific training does
not well equip us for. In this paper, I have attempted to explore this issue by
introducing analogy in its classical sense -not as a static entity or <i>fait
accompli</i>, but as a process linking simple elements or dimensions up into
more complex ones. Understanding that process allows us to find meaningful
relationship where initially we see only irreconcilable difference.</p>
<p>In essence, I have proposed (1) The psychological concept of
contradiction can be mathematically resolved, depicted and explained (2) The
simplest geometric resolution of mismatched information occurs during
triangulation. This is responsible for the creation of scale and orientation or
depth and perspective in 2D and 3D -in our eyes, ears and minds. (3) The
triangular relationship of elements, substances, fields, dimensions or reference
frames is classically an analogic one. </p>
<p>I also propose that contradiction of any sort is best
considered to be antithesis or paradox, rather than actuality. For, if we follow
the steps of classical analogy to find proportional relationship between the
elements, then the resolution of conflicting information or parameters is a
means of achieving both stability and simplicity. In other words, recognizing
that contradiction exists at various levels in our system is not considered to
be a flaw or a problem <i>per se</i>, but a vital indicator that our preferred,
primary thought system or physical orientation is at odds with respect to a
second or <i>n</i>th reference frame and that we must find a relationship
between them.</p>
<p>On the basis of the models presented in this paper, we can
say that seeing contradiction is likely a fundamental part of the process of
determining analogy -or creating fields of relationship. Conversely, the
principle of triangular and analogic relation is the essence of contradiction
both within and outside <b>TRIZ</b>,<b> </b>and the reason why <b>TRIZ</b> works
so well. </p>
<p>In conclusion, we can say that the ideal final result of
resolving contradiction <i>is</i> the process of analogy. And it would be
exceedingly pleasant to also add that contradiction and analogy are fundamental,
natural and universal rules of invention or decision-making -which is quite
within the realms of possibility [28]� But of course, proof as to whether that
is indeed the case must remain for another paper

<blockquote>
<p>* Of course Su-field models, which consist of 3 points and 2 arrows, are not
geometrically complete triangles, and the action of the second physical element
on the first takes place in an indirect manner, through the field. However, in
this paper we are essentially concerned with Machian principles [29], where all
our frameworks are relative ones, and not absolute. Thus, it should be possible
to recast the arrows of time and effect in Su-field, so that the relationship
between elements and fields can be seen as triangular and time independent. It
is beyond he scope of this paper to explore the intimations further, except to
suggest that such a reorientation of the model may allow us to better link
future and past of our problem-situation, rather than remain in the context of
the present action and event. </p>

<p>Analogy in modern mathematics</p>
</b>
<p>The relation between a model and the thing to be modelled can
be:</p>
<font COLOR="#0000ff">
<blockquote>
      <p>(a) Logical, in a formal system where there is structural similarity
      between model and system, and the same formal axiomatic and deductive
      relations connect elements and predicates of both system and model<br>
      (b) Replicative, in which there are material similarities between the parent
system and its replica, and structural</font> relations appear to
be exactly reproduced, though in varying scale and degrees of detail, and/or in
different media.</p>
    </blockquote>
<p>In either case, a member, x, of a set, is analogous to its
fellow member, y, when either:</p>
<font COLOR="#008000">
  <p>(a) x and y share several objective properties (or are equal in some respects)<br>
  (b) there exists a correspondence between the parts of x or the properties of x
  and those of y.
  </p>
  </font>
<p>If x and y satisfy the first condition, they may be said to be substantially
analogous (e.g. in the case of any two atoms). If the second condition holds,
then x and y are formally analogous, irrespective of their constitution. If both
conditions hold, the analogy is known as an homologous one. </p>
<p>Of course, homology implies both substantial and formal analogy exist, and
substantial analogy implies formal analogy, but not conversely.</p>
<p>Further, if x and y are sets, then correspondence under condition (b) allows
for several degrees of formal analogy: </p>
<font COLOR="#0000ff">
<blockquote>
  <p>(1) plain, or some-some analogy, when some elements of x are paired with some
  elements of y.</p>
  <p>(2) injective, or all-some analogy, when every element of x is paired with an
  element of y.</p>
  <blockquote>
        <p>If relations and operations (which may be defined as structures) in
        the injecting set are preserved and not modified, injective analogy is
        further defined as <i>homomorphic</i>.</p>
      </blockquote>
<p>(3) bijective, or all-all analogy, when the preceding relations hold both
ways.</font> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The special case of homomorphism from x into y and also from y into x, while
the two morphisms compensate each other, is <i>isomorphism</i>. In modern terms,
this is actually perfect analogy. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dimension </p>
</b>
<p>A <i>dimension</i>, in an everyday sense, is any measurable
quality. It does not exist as an inherent feature of the cosmos. Rather, the
creation of separated dimensions is an arbitrary, intellectual convenience,
which originally comes to us courtesy of Euclid [23, 24] and Descartes [25, 26],
and allows us to systematically, mathematically plot particular changes in the
behaviour or qualities of the object or event of our interest on an imaginary
graphical space. Usually, it is designed to separate an object of interest into
discrete, measurable chunks and separate the result �done� from the �doer� and
the �process of doing�.</p>
<p>However, we know a dimension, by its function, or what it
does. Using only a static definition of dimension will keep us from seeing
difference as intrinsic to establishing a relationship connecting identities or,
conversely, to identifying the contradiction which breaks a harmonic
relationship down.</p>
<p>Needless to say, factors which are hidden or implicit in our
worldview are those which lead to paradox or apparent contradiction, when high
levels of resolution are required. They can cause us to see lacunarity -
glitches, gaps, other mismatches and apparent noise in our data, rather than
coherent patterns.</p>
<b>
</b>
<p>Consider, for example, that we only know a straight line
exists, by tracing it out from A to B in our minds or with a pen, in time as
well as space. In Euclidean space, a straight line is defined as 1D. That means
time (ostensibly a second dimension) must always be hidden, embedded or implicit
in our measurement. Furthermore, it also means the observer (ostensibly a third
dimension) must be hidden, embedded or implicit.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the line is only straight, if we collapse,
suspend or remove time and project all the incremental reference frames created
during the process of drawing onto a single piece of paper and consider this
view is perpendicular to the �time axis�. Were we to take enough photos to
completely cover the process of drawing our line on a flat page and then stack
the individual frames, so that their bottom-left coordinates overlap with the
origin of a Cartesian reference frame... and were we then to make an arbitrary,
oblique slice through the stack, the cross-sectional view would not be straight
but skewed or even arcuate. This is because when we stand at an oblique angle to
our primary reference frame, we introduce perspective (an additional rotated
reference frame) and apparently stretch space and time.</p>
<b>
<p>Reference Frame </p>
</b>
<p>The graphs we prefer in the Western world usually have one,
two or three mutually perpendicular straight line axes, labelled x, y and z, and
allow us to speak of matter, energy and spacetime for example, as having 1D, 2D
or 3D -as having respectively position, area and volume. These are our <i>
reference frame</i>; a worldview or higher order starting point that results
from combining one or more dimensions.</p>
<p>Regarding the function of a reference frame or worldview: It
effectively allows contradictory variables to co-exist. It enables differences
to be measured and depth to be created. If we say that each individual has a
preferred worldview, called the <i>primary reference frame</i>, we can also say
that that this may or may not be identical with the primary reference frame of
the scientific society. Two or more reference frames may be related in analogic
relationship, whereby new information can be immediately applied in apparently
unrelated areas.</p>
