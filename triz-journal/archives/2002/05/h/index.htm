<p>TRISolver 2.1� is the first English-language version of the software from
TRISolver Consulting Group in Germany. (In our review of a competitive product
in March, the editors explained their history and possible biases in working
with TRIZ-based software-the same conditions apply to this review.) For readers
who want explore the product for themselves, see
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.trisolver.com">http://www.trisolver.com</a>.</p>
<p>You can use TRISolver 2.1� as a database for TRIZ problem solving or as a
guide to the methodology. The databases include</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>40 TRIZ inventive principles </li>
  <li>The Contradiction Matrix</li>
  <li>4 groups of TRIZ separation principles </li>
  <li>12 innovation principles for business &amp; management. See the December 2001
  issue of the TRIZ Journal for the article �TRIZ-based Innovation Principles
  and a Process for Problem Solving in Business and Management� by Bruno Ruchti
  and Pavel Livotov for a discussion of these principles and their use.</li>
  <li>Checklist for the identification and utilization of system resources </li>
  <li>76 TRIZ standard solutions with approximately 100 situations of
  substance-field analysis </li>
  <li>5 groups of patterns of evolution of technical systems </li>
  <li>Catalogue of physical, chemical and geometrical effects. </li>
</ul>
<p>Users can add their own examples to each of the databases as text, or
illustrations can be added as bmp files. This points out one major difference
between TRISolver and some of its competitors that allow users to add examples
from web pages, Word, PowerPoint or other sources, and competitors that animate
the illustrations-this is a text-based program, with very limited use of
pictures, graphics, or illustrations. </p>
<p>One somewhat annoying feature is the unpredictability of the examples. When
the users right-clicks on any of the database items, a menu pops up that offers
the choice Display Examples and Insert Examples. But, only certain databases
(the 40 principles, the 12 management principles, the 76 Standard Solutions)
have examples in those databases. The effects, the separation principles, and
the patterns of evolution do not have examples. A new user can waste a lot of
time looking for examples that don�t exist. </p>
<p>Another problem for new users is that many of the features are accessed by
right click menus. If you haven�t read the Help files, and you don�t know that
the features are in the program, you might never find them! </p>
<p>The TRISolver Method part of the program is based on ARIZ-85. The user is
guided through each of the steps of ARIZ, with questions to answer, lists to
complete, etc. The software does some processing of the lists. For example, it
generates pairs of components as candidates for contradiction pairs that could
generate technical contradictions, and it guides the user into defining the
functions that link each pair of components. </p>
<p>The program enforces the discipline familiar to ARIZ users-it won�t let you
skip steps. Some users will welcome this help, and others will find it
constraining. If you don�t know how to answer a question or complete a step, you
can consult the comprehensive Help files or view the case study which is
included in the system. These Help files constitute an excellent ARIZ textbook,
and the case study is very well documented. For future versions of the software,
we would like to suggest context-sensitive Help (It can take a long time to find
the Help for the particular issue that the user is working on!) </p>
<p>The Idea Manager accumulates the ideas that the user generates, either in the
course of applying ARIZ or in accessing the databases directly, and has many
options for organizing the ideas into reports for printing, posting to a web
site, etc. </p>
<p>Internet-based patent search tools have become standard in TRIZ-based
software, and TRISolver has a good capability for searches. The German heritage
of the program shows through in the choice of databases to be searched, and in
occasional non-English spellings of words (�effects� becomes �effekts�
occasionally, etc.) but there is no problem understanding or using the program
for non-speakers of German, and no problem adding the users� favorite patent
offices or search sites. </p>
<p>The scientific effects catalog is simply a catalog. There is no explanation
of the effects. For example, this is the listing for Change of Friction:</p>
<div align="left">
  <center>
  <table CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="3" cellpadding="7" bordercolor="#00FF00" style="border-collapse: collapse">
    <tr>
      <td><font COLOR="#000080">CHANGE OF FRICTION</p><ol>
        <li>Johnson-Rahbec-effect</li>
        <li>Action of radiation</li>
        <li>Effect of abnormal low friction</li>
        <li>Kragelsky-phenomena (wearless friction)</li>
        <li>Oscillation and vibration</li>
      </ol>
      </font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>(Note: Text in the green boxes is copyrighted material taken from the
TRISolver 2.1� software, and used for purposes of showing examples in this
review.)</p>
<p>If the user has never heard of the Johnson-Rahbec effect, or doesn�t know how
radiation can reduce friction, she�ll have to look in other references to find
out what it is, and if it can help solve her problem. </p>
<p>The listing itself has one unique feature that may be useful to some users.
The effects are cataloged both as actions generating effects and effects
generating actions. An example of the latter is shown below:</p>
<div align="left">

<p>The former method is more familiar to those who have learned to identify the
function to be performed, then look for effects that will perform it, but the
second method could be very useful in situations where functional resources have
been identified and the users is looking for ways that those resources could be
exploited.</p>
<p>TRISolver 2.1 sells for 990 Euros. Readers who are shopping for TRIZ-based
software should give it serious consideration.</p>
