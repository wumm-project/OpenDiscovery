<p>ABSTRACT</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ research has shown that the strongest solutions and
ideas are the ones in which the problem or opportunity owner has successfully
challenged the conflicts and trade-offs that others have assumed to be
fundamental. Classical TRIZ includes a Matrix that enables owners of technical
problems to quickly identify the inventive strategies used by others facing
similar design conflicts. The paper describes the creation of a brand new
Contradiction Matrix tool aimed specifically at business applications of TRIZ.
The tool is believed to offer problem solvers the same ready access to the best
of other business solutions, and as such offers a previously unknown problem
solving capability. The new tool has been constructed from the analysis of a
large proportion of the published knowledge on businesses that have successfully
challenged the win-lose contradictions their competitors had not recognised or
assumed were not challengeable. In all, several hundred win-win cases have been
identified and included in the analysis. The paper describes some of the most
well known of these cases - and how they have influenced the structuring and
content of the new Matrix. A short final section of the paper describes how the
new Matrix is beginning to be used to successfully generate win-win solutions to
real business problems that would normally be solved using conventional
either/or thinking strategies.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
</font></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Question. What have Cisco, Virgin, Schwab, GE Capital,
Benetton, Enron, South West Airlines, Home Depot, Wal-Mart, America West, eBay,
Barnes and Noble, Body Shop, Sephora, IBM (e-business), Sony Computer
Entertainment, Shell, Dell, Disney, Harley-Davidson, IKEA, Tesco, Starbucks,
Hotmail and Toyota have in common? Answer. Two things. One; non-linear growth
patterns. Two; they have achieved their phenomenal business performance by
successfully challenging the prevailing trade-offs and conflicts of their
industry and �eliminating� key contradictions their competitors assumed were
inherent. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most leaders and managers are at least beginning to recognize
the inherent weaknesses of compromise-based thinking approaches. The idea of
win-win solutions is, conceptually at least, highly appealing. The database of
win-win solutions in the business environment is, however, sparse. It is also
though highly revealing; win-win solutions pay enormous dividends in terms of
business performance. Figure 1 illustrates three such examples taken from
Reference 1 - one of the first published articles quantifying the benefits of
win-win approaches.</p>

</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the business environment, win-win is commonly viewed from
a �nice to have, but there is no method, so we can�t do it� perspective. There
is probably also a considerable element of conditioning to several millennia of
either/or thinking systems. One of the basic tenets of the TRIZ (2, 3) is that
�someone, somewhere has most likely already solved something like your problem�.
One of the key elements of the TRIZ philosophy is that different disciplines
don�t talk to each other, and consequently much re-inventing of wheels takes
place. Another key finding of TRIZ - via the analysis of a considerable
proportion of the world�s most successful engineering solutions - is that the
most effective solutions occur when a problem solver has identified and
�eliminated� a contradiction rather than accepting the trade-offs their
prevailing contemporaries have taken to be inherent. The net result of this
patent analysis is that there are - so far at least - just 40 different
strategies available to help in this process of contradiction elimination.
Subsequent research has thus far confirmed that it is precisely the same 40
strategies that are being used in achieving successful contradiction-breaking,
win-win solutions in a business context (4).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We explore here the codification of these strategies in their
business context and the construction of tools to help problem, conflict or
opportunity owners achieve win-win outcomes in systematically reproducible
manners.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>
<p>BUSINESS MATRIX</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Contradiction Matrix contained within classical TRIZ (3)
enables a user to identify pairs of conflicting parameters from a list of 39
most commonly used engineering parameters - length, weight, power, reliability,
etc. The Matrix then provides the three or four Inventive Principles found by
others to successfully challenge the particular conflict. The classical Matrix
was compiled from an analysis of a substantial number of successful engineering
solutions. Although the tool is now relatively old, and is dismissed as a �toy�
in some parts of the TRIZ community, the concept is believed to be fundamentally
sound and that its only current flaw is that it has not been updated to match
the evolving world of invention.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While initial work has confirmed the validity of the
Inventive Principles in a business environment, the parameters of the classical
Matrix bear only passing relevance to the issues of relevance in a
non-engineering context. One of the first tasks of the work to generate a
business version of the Matrix, therefore, was to formulate a structure offering
direct relevance to business issues. The business environment is of course
highly diverse, multi-dimensional and highly complex, and there were many
possible ways of segmenting the total picture.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The pioneering thinking of W. Edwards Deming (5) in which the
production of goods (and services) was drawn as a process for the first time was
used as a start point - and resulted in a segmentation of problem areas in terms
of the different fundamental parts of that process - initial research,
development and �pre-production� activities, the production process, the supply
process and the post-supply �support� activities - Figure 2. </p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font><font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 2: Production Viewed As A System - </b>W.E.Deming
(1950)</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="08a.gif" width="586" height="264"></p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within each of those elements, then, the primary parameters
of interest were segmented in terms of physical attributes (essentially
specification, quality, capability, and means), time attributes, cost
attributes, risk attributes and, in-line with emerging thinking (6) that it is
often not the �things� but the �thing between the things� that are the important
elements, �interface� attributes. Added to this basic framework were then the
other important attributes that we observed from the business literature that
were commonly of interest in tackling business problem situations. In order to
make the size of this list manageable, a degree of abstraction was performed
similar to that done when the Matrix of classical TRIZ was formulated. The
eventually selected list of 31 parameters is reproduced in Figure 3.</p>
<font SIZE="2"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font><font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 3: 31 Parameters of the Business Contradiction Matrix</p>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<img border="0" src="08b.gif" width="399" height="214"></font></p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the subsequent process of identifying case studies
that fitted the structure, and beyond to the present time, a philosophy of
flexibility and amenability to change has been adopted. As it happen, the
analysis has supported the segmentation structure used, but as with any new
tool, the current version is very much viewed as a �useful start� rather than a
�definitive end�. The new Matrix is intended to function in much the same way as
the classical Matrix; the user is encouraged to think about what they are trying
to improve and then what is stopping them from making the improvement. The
numbers in the boxes representing the intersection of the improving and
worsening parameters then represent the inventive strategies used by others who
have successfully challenged the particular either-or trade-off under
consideration. The idea is illustrated in Figure 4.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike the original technical Matrix, this new one has been
constructed in a symmetrical form (i.e. the same results are obtained by looking
up an A versus B as a B versus A contradiction) in order to ease use. In the
fullness of time, as more examples emerge, it is likely that the Matrix will be
expanded to allow any dis-similarities in strategy between improving one of a
pair of conflict parameters over another to be presented to the problem solver.
</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In constructing the Matrix, each box was completed through a
combination of two mechanisms; the first involving an equivalent of the original
TRIZ research - identifying successes from known existing solutions and
abstracting the information they contain - the second involving simulation of
hypothetical conflict scenarios and, one-by-one, identifying the Inventive
Principles which generated the most effective looking solution directions. With
the total number of available published case studies numbering only in hundreds
(as compared to several million patents), the current version of the Matrix is
thus viewed as a first step towards eventual maturity as progressively more
win-win conflict resolution cases emerge and become integrated into the
framework. The next section illustrates a few of the case studies used and the
method of abstraction used during the construction of the new Matrix: </p>

<font FACE="Arial">
<p>1) South West Airlines</p>
</font></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The story of South West Airlines� success represents
something of a phenomenon across the business spectrum with the book of the
story (7) being one of the most widely read business books of the 90s. South
West Airlines is known particularly for being �the� low cost airline with
�positively outrageous service�. Thus, in the terms of a contradiction, they
have successfully challenged the conflict between cost and quality; as much in
terms of customer interface as quality of service - e.g. food on the airline
usually consists of a bag of nuts) which their competitors (and most passengers)
assumed was fundamental.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To distill the success of South West into one or two
Inventive Principles would be somewhat trite in light of the breadth of
solutions that have contributed to their overall success, but for the purposes
of the Matrix, the following strategies were abstracted from the reference:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Principles 38 �Enriched Atmosphere� - for the way the whole
  organisation works together as a truly empowered team to achieve not just
  legendary service but the fastest turnaround times, highest ratio of customers
  served per number of employees, highest customer retention figures and overall
  profitability of the whole airline industry.</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Principle 1 �Segmentation� - in the way it segments its
  route plans and determines which cities and airports it will serve</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Principle 25 -�Self-Service - in the way it empowers and
  encourages employees to make decisions themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2) Schwab</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The case of security brokerage Charles Schwab�s transition to
leading e-based share dealer has been discussed on several occasions (8, 9). As
discussed in (9), the company has successfully challenged the richness (quality
of information or service) versus reach (number of customers reached)
contradiction present in many industries. Figure 5 illustrates how they
originally adopted trade-off approaches involving first telephone brokerage and
then touch-tone dialling as means of increasing reach (at the expense of
richness). The figure also illustrates how, when they introduced on-line dealing
in 1998 they successfully broke the contradiction and became able to reach a
very wide customer base with a service they now claim to offer higher richness
than that achievable via a full service broker.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 5: Richness versus Reach Contradiction Broken by the
Internet </p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of the new Matrix, the �richness versus reach�
contradiction was judged to most closely match a conflict between the Matrix
parameters �supply specification� and �supply interface�. The use of an Internet
solution to the contradiction represents use of Principle 6 �Universality� (i.e.
the Internet provides a universal communication protocol) and Principle 40
�Composite Structures�, and both of these parameters consequently appear in the
Matrix. Reference 9 also describes other cases of organisations successfully
challenging the richness versus reach contradiction. These and other cases
feature application of Principles 15 �Dynamics� and 30 �Thin &amp; Flexible� and
hence the Matrix tool contains all four suggestions.</p>

<p>3) Benetton</p>
</font></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fashion industry faces a challenge every year in the race
to get product to the customer once the season�s colours have begun to
demonstrate their popularity. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Benetton�s success is to a significant extent built from the
way they have solved the contradiction between the time available to commit a
production decision versus the versatility of the clothes that get produced.
Before Benetton�s arrival, other clothing manufacturers adopted an essentially
trade-off based approach to the problem, with often intricately calculated
optimizations to achieve acceptable values of product match to fashion demands
versus production commitment time.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Benetton overcame the contradiction by first recognizing that
the greatest fashion uncertainty was colour and then working out the means to
knit and assemble the clothes before they were dyed. In this way they were able
to commit to the time consuming parts of the manufacture process early and then
once the season�s fashionable colours had emerged, they only had to conduct the
final dyeing operation. Thus Benetton used Principle 10 �Prior Action�.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Benetton contradiction is located in the Matrix as the
conflict between �Production Time� and �Versatility� - Figure 6. Analysis of
other cases shows this use of �prior action� to now be a common strategy in
solving this type of problem. The Matrix reflects this by placing Principle 10
as the most likely strategy.</p>

<p>4) Lockheed Skunkworks</p>
</b></font><font FACE="CG Times">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lockheed Skunkworks is a world renowned centre of excellence
in terms of its ability to complete leading edge aerospace R&amp;D in uniquely low
lead-times and costs (10). </font>Like many high-technology organisations,
Lockheed faced the contradiction between the desire to effectively harness the
R&amp;D capabilities of the organization in a cost environment geared up to operate
on a production line basis.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Compromise solutions to the conflict usually involve parallel
operation of prototype and production facilities with prototype jobs done when
there is capacity in the production side of the business.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lockheed famously decided to completely separate out the R&amp;D
operation into what has now become a watchword in rapid, low-cost prototyping.
Although again simplistic, in terms of the Matrix, they used Principle 2 �Taking
out� to successfully challenge the contradiction between R&amp;D
specification/quality and R&amp;D cost.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The above four examples are but a tiny sample of the several
hundred cases examined in constructing the Matrix. Reverse engineering of
historical business success stories to help generate a knowledge framework and
the subsequent application of that framework to solve as yet unsolved problems
are of course two different things. The new Business Matrix has been validated
in this application role over the last two years on a number of real business
conflict issues. The majority of these cases are unfortunately not available for
circulation in the public domain. A case - looking at a problem involving poor
transition of research to market - is however available in Reference 11. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The full Business Matrix is available in electronic form at
Reference 12. Further case study applications of the Matrix will be published in
coming months. We turn our attention now, however, to the consideration of
physical contradictions in a business context:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>
<p>PHYSICAL CONTRADICTIONS</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Physical contradictions of the sort �X should be Y AND notY�
or �A is right and B is right, but their two rights are different� are very
common in business situations. Resolution of such conflicts is often amenable to
use of the strategies contained within the separation tools within classical
TRIZ. It is important to note, however, that a vital prior step is to gain a
clear understanding of the root causes of the conflict. We have found that the
most effective means of achieving this understanding comes through the use of
the three-dimensional form of the TRIZ system operator tool described in
Reference 13. The concept of segmenting space, time and �interface� (14) and the
key phrase �the map is not the territory� (15) - see Figure 7 - are crucial in
terms of identifying where, when and how conflicts arise. A very simple means of
applying the Figure 6 tool is to describe the given problem situation in each of
the boxes. The emergence of differences between boxes then identifies the form
of contradiction present. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most common type of contradiction to emerge based on
experience to date is the one drawn in the figure - that of different
interpretations (maps) of the actual situation (territory). Often the conflict
is resolved immediately upon drawing this picture. In cases where it is not, the
physical contradiction separation strategies become the next available set of
triggers to act as a focus for identifying win-win (as opposed to win-lose
compromise), after the figure has been used to identify the type of
contradiction present. In this regard, we have found that the time, space,
condition and transition separation strategies found in classical TRIZ apply
equally well in business situations. We have also found that the same basic list
of Inventive Principles is relevant in each separation strategy - albeit the
size of the lists can be usefully expanded to encompass more of the 40 available
Principles. The list typically then used for business-type physical
contradiction situations is reproduced in Figure 8. </p>

  </tr>
</table>
</center>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of the four separation strategies, we also note differences
in the rate and power of application. Thus, for example, analysis of published
cases suggests that Principle 1, �Segmentation� is easily the most commonly
applied means of resolving many physical contradictions. On the other hand, the
strategies recommended by the separation on condition and transition
contradiction types seem to present the opportunities for the most substantial
win-win outcomes.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By way of a simple illustration of both of the above points,
a brief example is illustrated below. The case is real, but the details have
been abstracted in order to make it relevant to a TRIZ audience.</p>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p>The Patriarch</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">X is a self-made man. He has set up a pre-prepared food
products company and nurtured its growth over a period of 20 years. The company
now employs over 200 people. X has been the source of nearly all of the sales
made by the company to the extent that the company doe not possess a sales team.
The basis of X�s success has been the personal relationships he has built up
with the client base over the life of the company. It is now time for X to
retire, however, and he is in the process of handing over the running of the
company to his oldest son. He has stated that he still wants to help in the
sales area during the transition. One of the first things the son does, however,
is to appoint a sales manager. He does this because a) he is not interested in
the sales side of the business, and b) because he wants to help his father
transition to a happy retirement as soon as possible. Within two months of the
appointment of the sales manager, two major clients have been lost, and total
sales are down by over 20%.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(As initially presented, this problem was expressed as �how
do we recover/improve sales?� - the above description is the result of an
initial problem definition session using the �why/what�s-stopping� root cause
analysis described in reference 16.)</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The outcome of the root cause analysis was a recognition that
the father and the new sales manager had very different maps of the client
territory - the father thinking that the clients were primarily buying from the
company because of his personal relationships; the sales manager thinking they
were buying because the product offered the best value on the market. It was
eventually agreed that after taking into account the different map issues, there
was a real contradiction; that �the father should be present and not present�.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Separation in both space and time using �segmentation�
offered an immediate resolution strategy to the contradiction - in that both the
father�s and the sales manager�s maps were correct at different times and with
different clients. Segmentation turned out to be simple and easy to apply, and
it did indeed restore sales very quickly, but it didn�t resolve the longer term
issues associated with the fact that those clients who bought from the company
because of their personal relationship with the father were eventually going to
be disappointed when his retirement was full-time.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The eventual solution to the problem came from the -
initially un-promising sounding - Principle 27, Cheap/Short Living suggestion
emerging from a transition to the sub-system solution direction.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The answer; placing an image of the father on the labelling
of the company�s products. The method; the clients who bought from the company
because of the father could now see him on every product they bought from the
company (a la Colonel Saunders).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font FACE="Arial" size="2">
<p>FINAL THOUGHTS AND FUTURE WORK</p>
</font></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new Business Matrix and physical contradiction resolution
tools have been borne of a desire to abstract the win-win strategies employed by
the world�s most successful businesses. Although the benefits of win-win over
either/or thinking strategies are apparent to many, the application of TRIZ
abstraction strategies to codify the established good-practice of business into
a form that makes it generically applicable to organisations in other industries
or fields, is only just beginning to emerge. The original TRIZ Matrix was
constructed from many thousands of examples of technical success. The equivalent
database of �business success� is far smaller and so the new tool cannot offer
the same level of either authority or guaranteed effectiveness as the original
tool. On the other hand, based on the growing database of business problems they
have been used to successfully solve, it seems at the very least that they offer
a �useful start�. The long-term aim is to expand the database to include more
examples, and a programme of systematic research is underway to continue this
process.</p>
