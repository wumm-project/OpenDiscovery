<p>Abstract</p>
</b>
<p>�Root cause analysis� is often described as an essential step in the problem
definition process. Many organisations devote considerable resources to the
technique. In line with the Deming dictum �the most important numbers are
unknown and unknowable, few appear to reap the due rewards of their efforts. It
is our contention here that there are times when it is either not possible or
not affordable to ascertain the root causes underlying a manifested problem. We
propose a better way - root contradiction analysis - one requiring less analysis
time and effort, and more often than not capable of delivering more powerful
solutions. We present two case study examples to demonstrate the method and how
it should change the way we think about many problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Introduction</p>
</b>
<p>All of the disciplines within any kind of organization routinely seek to
solve their problems. All of us who are a part of an organization are problem
solvers . . . and root cause analysts, although many of us may prefer to think
of our problem solving process as something less fancy than &quot;root cause
analysis&quot;. But, as we come to our problems in an effort to control and prevent
interruptions, obstacles, errors, and counter-quality occurrences, we
none-the-less are all looking for the same things: root causes of problems that
when removed prevent the problem. So, whether our work is Quality, Engineering,
Safety, Production, Maintenance, or just about any other function in the
organization, we should be comfortable with the concept of root cause analysis,
or whatever we want to call the task of finding the root causes and best
prevention solutions to our operations problems.</p>
<p>First let�s clarify what it is we are talking about when we say &quot;prevention
solutions&quot;, or rather what we are not talking about. Fixing things, cleaning up,
removing, reworking, redesigning, modifying, and fortifying, are not prevention
and control steps. They instead are correction steps. These actions may or may
not be a result of prevention actions, but they in themselves are not prevention
steps. Prevention has to do with WHY the design was inadequate, WHY the machine
needs repair, WHY cleanup is necessary. This is not to say that these
correction-step responses are not important to the operation. Certainly we want
to discover immediately when things need early repair. Root cause analysis
should uncover such opportunities to remedy, but clearly, as our primary goal
for analysis, we want to design out of our operation the need for avoidable
repair, rework, clean up, and expensive redesign. We are trying to find
something that someone can do to keep the problem from ever happening again.
Obviously the act of cleaning up the mess every time the problem occurs is not
prevention. We must instead design <i>prevention</i> and <i>control</i> into how
we do things. That is what meaningful root cause analysis is all about.</p>
<p>So much for the theory. When we actually get down to the mechanics of root
cause analysis, on the other hand, things have a tendency to get out of hand
very quickly. Quite simply, root cause analysis requires data. Asking �why�
means we have to understand the system. To understand the system requires data.
Usually, lots of data. Very often the cost and time involved in capturing that
data can be prohibitive.</p>
<p>One particular example that springs to mind was a case study we were asked to
work on regarding a manufacture operation to drill a row of 40 very small (circa
30</font><font FACE="Symbol">m</font><font FACE="Arial">m diameter) holes
simultaneously through a relatively thick (circa 15mm) structure. The basic
problem was that the method used to drill the holes coupled with the length of
the holes meant that some of the holes were mis-aligned relative to the others.
During the course of finding out WHY this was happening a team of four
root-cause analysts spent over 3 months each configuring and running experiments
to try and get to the bottom of the matter. Four people times three months each
is a lot of man-hours and a lot of money, never mind the cost of running the
experiments and all the scrap parts produced.</p>
<p>The team were using a proprietary root cause analysis method which is both
rigorous in its approach and known to generate results in a good many instances.</p>
<p>The problem with it, and root cause analysis in general is that it only stops
when the root cause has been found. If this takes a few hours, this is not a
problem. But if it means a person-year and still no answer, we should start to
ask whether there is a better way.</p>
<p>The suggestion here is that there is indeed a better way. We call it �root
contradiction analysis� (Reference 1). The key similarity between this method
and root cause analysis is that both are built on the question �WHY?� The first
key difference is that, while root cause analysis has a voracious appetite for
data, root contradiction analysis requires only that we gain a qualitative
understanding of what is happening in a system.</p>
<p>The second key difference - one even more important than the first - is that
root cause analysis is a method closely allied to optimisation of processes,
while root contradiction analysis is about recognising systems hit fundamental
limits, beyond which no amount of optimisation will go. In other words, you
could spend an infinite amount of time gathering data to help optimise something
that refuses to be optimised any further. This �fundamental limit� concept lies
at the heart of system evolution s-curves - the levelling effect at the top of
the curve being the net result of a limiting contradiction in action.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>Desires to reduce defects during manufacture offer a simple demonstration of
the limiting contradiction effect in action. Six Sigma techniques are there to
help deliver such reductions. They are fine until such times as a system hits a
fundamental limit - as illustrated in Figure 1. At the top-most limits of an
s-curve, no amount of additional analysis or improvement effort is going to
deliver the stated improvement aims; the system has to be changed in some way -
and a new s-curve has to be found.</p>

</b></font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>The Contradictions part of TRIZ is the only systematic way in existence for
helping us to jump from one optimised system to a better way of doing things.
Root Contradiction Analysis is about helping us to find the key contradictions
we need to solve if we are to make the jump to that new system.</p>
<p>In the case of the hole-drilling example, the Root Contradiction Analysis
took around an hour to establish that a) the current system was at the limits of
its fundamental capability and the root cause analysts were simply pushing it
over the edge of a cliff, and b) the root contradiction was quickly traced from
the fact we knew that there was no problem when the hole length was only 12mm,
or if there were only 30 holes to be drilled. The cliff the system had fallen
off was a contradiction between the length of the drill and its stability.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later we had a segmented design solution. Two hours after that we
had our first working prototype.</p>
<p>The example is not intended to say that Root Contradiction Analysis works
miracles. We still have to do a lot of thinking - �why� is the most difficult of
the 5Ws (Reference 2) - but at least we don�t have to accompany it with a
warehouse full of expensive-to-acquire data, and we know that solving
contradictions is fundamentally good direction to travel in any event.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" size="2"><b>
<p>Root Contradictions Example - 1) A Better Wind-Turbine</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>A good example of technical contradictions in action and why it helps to
think about �root contradictions� comes in the form of a look at a real problem
associated with the design of wind-turbines. As well as showing TRIZ in action
on a problem that has not yet been solved, the example seeks to offer an
additional learning point as we transition from conceptual to specific
solutions, linking in to other parts of the problem solving toolkit. </p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>The problem under consideration concerns an issue affecting all
wind-turbines, but especially the large scale (500-750kW) machines - a typical
example of which is illustrated in Figure 2.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="02b.jpg" width="200" height="281"><br>
Figure 2: Typical Large-Scale Wind Turbine </p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>The basic problem concerns what happens to the turbines in high winds, where
- perhaps surprisingly - as wind speed rises above a certain level, the turbine
wants to rotate too quickly, the centrifugal forces from which then cause the
blades to want to fly off. The current strategy for solving this problem is to
stop rotation altogether when the wind is too high. Paradoxically, therefore,
when the wind contains the most energy, the wind-turbine captures the least. It
is desirable to not have to stop the turbine during high wind conditions.</p>
<p>The problem very definitely contains a contradiction; the basic thing we
would like to improve in this situation is the ability to operate in high winds;
the thing that stops us is that the blade falls off. Relating these two sides of
the contradiction to the Matrix, it appears clear that the improving parameter
connects best to SPEED. More difficult is the worsening parameter. From �the
blade falls off�, we might make connections to Harmful Side Effects, Force,
Stress, Area, Reliability or Strength. Maybe even Loss of Substance if we�re
thinking very laterally. Now, we could chose to look up the conflicting pairs
for each of these possibilities - in which case we would end up with the rather
high number of 19 different Inventive Principle suggestions, with only three
appearing more than once. There is nothing wrong with this approach of course,
but it would be rather time consuming and difficult to maintain level of effort
at an acceptable level as we try and generate solutions from all 19 of the
Principles. The alternative is to think a little more specifically about the
problem and try to focus in on exactly what the problem is using a form of �root
contradiction� analysis.</p>
<p>The logic for this goes something like:</p>
<dl>
  <dd>The blades fall off. (Matrix parameter = Loss of Substance, Reliability)
  </dd>
  </font><font FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000ff">
  <dd>Why?</dd>
  </font><font FACE="Arial">
  <dd>The loads are too high. (Matrix parameter = Force, Stress, Area)</dd>
  </font><font FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000ff">
  <dd>Why?</dd>
  </font><font FACE="Arial">
  <dd>Insufficient strength of material. (Matrix parameter = Strength)</dd>
  </font><font FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000ff">
  <dd>Why?</dd>
</dl>
</font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>Limits of science.</p>
<p>At which point we reach the end of the line. So, what we learn from this �ask
why five times� route (apart from the fact we ran out of why�s after three), is
that the root contradiction is the one involving Strength. What we mean by
�root� is that if we solve the contradiction at this level we automatically
solve the other problems (whereas if we solve the contradiction at the �blades
fall off� level, we could still have a strength problem).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if we have a situation like this where the list of
possible contradictions and the resulting list of Inventive Principles is
unworkably high, then it is a good idea to focus in at root level.</p>
<p>So what happens when we do that, and focus this wind-turbine problem on the
speed versus strength contradiction?</p>
<p>For a start, the Matrix recommends the following Inventive Principles:</p>

      <td>-</td>
      <td><font FACE="Arial">&nbsp;Curvature</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>Rather than repeat the mechanics of connecting these triggers to possible
solutions as we have done in previous articles (if we were doing this for real,
we would of course do exactly what we have suggested previously), it is perhaps
useful to examine another, different strategy. In this case, the strategy
involves a link with the knowledge/effects part of the TRIZ problem solving
toolkit, or rather with the patent-search element thereof.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to see if anyone else has already made the connection
between the Inventive Principles being suggested and something like the system
under evaluation.</p>
<p>The easiest of the four Inventive Principles recommended from the root
contradiction to do this with is �Curvature�. The question we pose through an
on-line patent search engine is, � has anyone developed a blade with a curve?�
To answer the question requires us to investigate searches of �blade� (and
synonyms) and �curve� (and synonyms). Simply combining the two words should,
irrespective of anything we find on the patent database, suggest to us the idea
of a curved blade. The key point of finding other solutions where this
connection has already been made is in helping us to pin down exactly what sort
of curvature others have applied, and whether, when they have applied it, it has
solved a speed versus strength contradiction. Very quickly using the �blade�
plus �curve� search idea reveals that quite a few people have already combined
the two words to precisely help solve a speed-v-strength contradiction. These
include:-</p>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li><font FACE="Arial">propeller design</li>
  </font>
  <li><font FACE="Arial">jet-engine fan blade design - �sword-fan�</li>
  </font>
  <li><font FACE="Arial">a centrifugal compressor</li>
  </font>
  <li><font FACE="Arial">high speed wing design</li>
  </font>
  <li><font FACE="Arial">a boomerang-like toy</li>
</ul>
</font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>Not only do these findings confirm the validity of the �curvature� direction,
they give us some pretty good steers on exactly what sort of curvature to use -
in this case to curve the blades away from the wind, and also swept back from
the direction of rotation.</p>
<p>Applying a similar search idea to �blade-and-counter-weight� and
�blade-and-copy� also reveals some promising ideas. �Blade-and-local quality� is
a more difficult search to conduct as �local quality� is a rather generic and
unlikely to be described in such terms within an invention disclosure. Here we
need to e a little bit more creative in our search strategy. Local Quality - as
detailed in the list of Principles at the end of the chapter - is about turning
uniform things into non-uniform things; making parts of a system function in
conditions most suitable to their operation, changing the local environment.
These suggestions might encourage us to search for patents featuring blades with
special tip, root, leading edge, or trailing edge geometries, local protrusions
or depressions, roughened profiles, different length segments, and so on. The
general point being that here we�re making hopefully useful connections between
problem component and solution trigger and using the patent database to validate
those connections. As it happens, several of the above have been used in a
variety of industries to solve precisely the contradiction we are tackling.</p>

<p>Root Contradictions Example - 2) WindShield/Backlight Molding Problem</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>Reference 3 provides an excellent example of the shift away from the
trade-off/optimisation way of doing things (�<i>Windshield and backlight molding
squeak problems have been in existence for several years. The issue became more
complicated about 10 years ago when a</p>
<p>change from metal molding to plastic was undertaken. Over the last five years
several teams tried to resolve the situation and a number of design alternatives
were explored. Unfortunately, no robust and cost effective solution was found�
</i>and<i> �a temporary solution has been developed and recently implemented by
the Vehicle Program Team that resolves this concern, however, additional
materials, assembly labor and variable cost were required. In addition, this
solution only addresses the flutter (buzz) problem and has no effect on molding
squeak.�) </i>A problem that has been around for ten years and consumed an
awfully large amount of effort to try and identify the root causes represents a
classic case of �the most important numbers are unknown and unknowable�.</p>
<p>For example, the report also quotes �<i>In our recent review of the test
equipment setup, several major faults were identified. Important test parameters
such as humidity, quality and handling of the test samples were not controlled,
resulting in poor test repeatability�.</i> </p>
<p>The classic response to conclusions like this is to set up an even more
complex set of experiments. Fortunately the report authors chose to shift to a
contradiction-eliminating strategy at this point - otherwise, the problem might
well still be in the root-cause identification phase another three years after
the article was published.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the authors summarised the problem they faced as <i>�The
molding lip must not squeak when subjected to small scale random oscillations
against the painted body sheet metal and, additionally, the lip must not buzz
when presented with any high speed air flow situation likely to occur during
usage.�</p>
</i></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>This problem description is derived after the connection between the two
problems of �squeak� and �buzz� had been made. What if they hadn�t? A root
contradiction analysis for the squeak problem should look something like this:-</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="02c.gif" width="407" height="256"><br>
Figure 3: Root Contradiction Analysis for Wind-Shield �Squeak� Problem</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>And similarly for the buzz problem:-</p>

<p align="left"><img border="0" src="02d.gif" width="407" height="256"><br>
Figure 4: Root Contradiction Analysis for Wind-Shield �Buzz� Problem</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>So, in other words, the analyses take us to a point where we establish that
material stiffness issues lie at the root of both problems. It then transpires
that for one problem we require high stiffness, and for the other we require low
stiffness. And thus we have identified a root contradiction - in this case a
physical one where we want the stiffness to be �high and low�.</p>
<p>If we then recognise the requirement for the different properties is in
different <i>places</i> (we want high stiffness on surfaces exposed to the
effects of the airflow (buzz), and we want very low stiffness at the point where
the molding touches the sheet metal (squeak)). We should thus look to the
Inventive Principles tailored for use in solving physical contradictions
separated in space. Such solution triggers will point directly to some of the
elegant solutions derived by the article authors, and also one or two they
didn�t.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Arial" size="2">
<p>Summary</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Arial">
<p>�The most important numbers are unknown and unknowable.� So said W.E. Deming.
The quote is particularly relevant to traditional root cause analysis - which
often has a seemingly never-ending appetite for data (experience says you will
almost never reach the point of �enough�). Finding root contradictions is
generally easier, cheaper and quicker than finding root causes. </p>
<p>It doesn�t mean, of course, that we need <i>no</i> data - the windshield
problem quite clearly highlights the fact that we need to know that there are
dependencies between different design parameters. But it quite clearly <i>does</i>
mean that gathering experimental data for several years is not the best way of
doing things. Several years - or even months or weeks - should suggest to us
that we are stuck in the traditional �trade-off� mind-set, and that there ought
to be a better way.</p>
<p>Root cause analysis is great for optimising systems. If the system has been
optimised to the limits of its capability, however, (as many manufacturing
processes have - thanks to years of �continuous improvement� initiatives) no
amount of additional optimisation will improve the result. The only way to
improve a fully optimised system is to change the system. Solving contradictions
is a great way to achieve this. Root Contradiction Analysis is a great way to
find the <i>right</i> contradictions to solve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Foot-Note</p>
</b>
<p>As stated in the quote at the beginning of the article, Edward De Bono has a
somewhat different perspective on eliminating the causes of problems -
suggesting that often it is better to find means of working to turn the root
cause into a resource and �designing around� a problem rather than trying to
literally eliminate it. Interested readers may care to explore this philosophy
further by checking out Reference 4.</p>
