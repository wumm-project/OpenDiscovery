<p align="left"><b>If TRIZ is so Good Why Isn�t Everyone Using it?</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Brian,</p>
  <p align="left">I read with interest <a href="../../04/e/index.htm">your
  letter</a> about the reasons why TRIZ isn�t as widely spread as it might be.</p>
  <p>Some of your points are valid, especially around books but this is being
  helped by publications such as the TRIZ journal. One analogy I would like to
  make here is that you do not become a stress analyst by sitting down and
  reading a book by Timoshenko. You will have to spend a considerable amount of
  time in a class room learning the basics and practising with them on simple
  problems first before you are let loose on analysing structures.</p>
  <p>Whilst TRIZ looks simple there are many years of development work gone into
  it and many people seem to forget this and try to run before they can walk.</p>
  <p>I hope the following will help the TRIZ community understand why it is
  where it is and no further on.</p>
  <p>Here at lford Imaging we have always tried to line up a number of problems
  in advance. This definitely helps keep our group going.</p>
  <p>I like your idea of a problem scheme and I will certainly follow this up
  with other managers.</p>
  <p>On your point of fashion fatigue I am not sure that this is true. Over the
  past number of years we have seen many initiatives coming down from above and
  companies have invested heavily. Many of these initiatives are about improving
  production, traceability and gaining control of the manufacturing process.
  From my experience TRIZ has not arrived like that. It has slowly emerged and
  been taken on by a few who see the benefits in the design office or laboratory
  and because of this there has not been the ground swell seen by these other
  approaches.</p>
  <p>Another reason might be because companies are using TRIZ in the development
  stages and they do not want to publicise their methods for developing new
  products, people may not be keen on telling others about the problems they
  have they would rather discuss the successes.</p>
  <p>The other reason for this is largely due to the Internet. For me if it were
  not for a chance meeting with Graham Rawlinson at an exhibition I would
  probably still be none the wiser. Much of my reading about TRIZ has come from
  the Internet and for most people this is done in isolation.</p>
  <p>From this develops a champion, if they are so inclined or otherwise they
  will keep it close to their chest and believe that they have a very powerful
  tool that they do not want to tell anyone else about. Depending on how good
  this person is at publicising this throughout their company will depend on
  whether it is adopted, developed and used on a regular basis. Only recently
  have large seminars on the topic of TRIZ been organised and the organisations
  who send out the mail shots will reach an audience of thousands not just the
  few who the existing TRIZ community have managed to get into contact.</p>
  <p>When speaking to our TRIZ group it becomes very clear that too many people
  spend their time fire fighting and to integrate TRIZ into everyday work
  becomes more difficult.</p>
  <p>I have been very lucky here at Ilford Imaging because although there has
  not been a great deal of money to work with I have been able to work with a
  group on a very regular basis. In doing this the knowledge that the
  methodology exists begins to filter through into the rest of the organisation.
  We still come up against people who know about TRIZ but don�t really trust it
  and they will only come to us as a last resort. They are always surprised at
  what we can do even after only a few sessions. </p>
  <p>Without a doubt there is a lot to learn in the TRIZ method and it cannot
  all be learnt in a two day course. Even after four years here at Mobberley we
  are looking at how to use the tools on a very regular basis and it is only by
  taking this drip feed approach will you become confident in their use.</p>
  <p>Another stumbling block I have seen on a number of occasions is when to use
  what tool. This is a real issue when first attempting to solve problems and
  until would be practitioners can break through this barrier they will
  struggle.</p>
  <p>John Terninko�s book Step By Step TRIZ makes a very useful point that often
  doing a function analysis will reveal the solution and if the solution is a
  level one solution and it solves your problem that does not matter. The fact
  that you have started a thought process that you would not normally have
  considered is going in the right direction. This may not be the purest
  approach but most of us do not have the luxury of hours and hours to analyse
  the system down to minute detail and there comes a point when we have to say
  enough is enough.</p>
  <p>Your suggestion that a person returning from a course would not have enough
  problems to work on is interesting. The group here at Ilford Imaging have
  worked on problems posed in Altshuller�s books and others as well as our own
  problems. We have also worked on Logic, Number and reasoning problems to try
  and develop our skill at thinking in different ways.</p>
  <p>At first the newly trained practitioner will still struggle to ask the
  right questions to find out what the actual problem is. Contradictions are
  easy to talk about but it takes practice to route them out of every day
  problems.</p>
  <p>This is where having a multi-disciplinary team helps a lot. If you cannot
  see the wood for the trees a different set of eyes is always helpful.</p>
  <p>Until TRIZ becomes management lead it will not get completely integrated as
  other methodologies have. However, we must be careful here. There are a great
  many companies who have invested in these approaches and I am not convinced
  that they have all taken on board the new techniques to the level we are made
  to believe they have. </p>
  <p>Those people who have invested many hours of effort will for the
  foreseeable future have to continue working away to publicise their successes
  and when they start to save money the their managers and accountants will
  begin to take note.</p>
  <p>I don�t necessarily believe that we should restrict this method to
  engineers and it doesn�t always make good engineers great. What it does do is
  make people better thinkers at the concept stage because they will be able to
  see the contradictions before the design has left the drawing board or
  laboratory.</p>
  <p>At this stage you will not have to answer the question did you use TRIZ.
  Once it is part of your thinking process everything you do will be tainted
  with TRIZ whether you realise it or not.</p>
  <p>Anyone who sets out to learn TRIZ starts on a long journey and you can
  begin to reap the benefits of the method soon after starting but your best
  solutions will take more time.</p>
  <p>However, you must not shy away from trying your techniques because without
  that practice you will not be able to think the unthinkable.</p>
  <p>Brian, I hope this goes someway to helping you answer your question.</p>

  <p>Dear Mr. Brian Campbell,</p>
  <p>CC: Dr. Ellen Domb, Editor of the TRIZ Journal,</p>
  <p>I read your article &quot;If TRIZ is such a good idea, why isn't everyone using
  it?&quot; (April 2002 TRIZ Journal) with much interest, because I had the same
  question in my mind for many years. </p>
  <p>To answer The question, I presented a paper in ETRIA Conference last
  November with the title of &quot;Learning and Applying the Essence of TRIZ with
  Easier USIT Procedure&quot;. The paper is posted in my Web site &quot;TRIZ Home Page in
  Japan&quot; in English: </p>
  <p>
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.osaka-gu.ac.jp/php/nakagawa/TRIZ/eTRIZ/epapers/eETRIAPapers0111/eETRIAPaper011107.html">
  http://www.osaka-gu.ac.jp/php/nakagawa/TRIZ/eTRIZ/epapers/eETRIAPapers0111/eETRIAPaper011107.html</a>
  <br>
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.osaka-gu.ac.jp/php/nakagawa/TRIZ/eTRIZ/">
  http://www.osaka-gu.ac.jp/php/nakagawa/TRIZ/eTRIZ/</a></p>
  <p>Let me summarize some of the points in my paper:</p>
  <p>(1) Penetration of TRIZ is slow not because TRIZ is poor, but rather
  because TRIZ is so rich.</p>
  <p>(2) Large body of handbook-type knowledge such as 40 Inventive Principles,
  76 Inventive Standards, Trends of Evolution, Contradiction Matrix, Effects
  database, etc. is presented to TRIZ students as basic knowledge, and often
  overwhelms the students.</p>
  <p>(3) TRIZ also contains a large number of methods for solving problems, such
  as Su-Field model, multi-screen method, Contradiction Matrix method, modeling
  with Smart Little People, ARIZ, etc. </p>
  <p>They are voluminous and some of them are partly redundant among others. </p>
  <p>(4) The essence of TRIZ (behind such knowledge-bases and problem solving
  methods) is seldom stated/taught clearly. Thus students feel difficulties in
  understanding the TRIZ philosophy and mastering TRIZ way of thinking in
  problem solving. </p>
  <p>(5) For overcoming these situations, we should present the essence of TRIZ
  in a clearer way. See Nakagawa's &quot;Essence of TRIZ in 50 Words&quot; in the paper
  (also reposted in the TRIZ Journal: <a href="../../../2001/06/d/index.htm">
  http://www.triz-journal.com/archives/2001/06/d/index.htm</a>)</p>
  <p>(6) We should also reorganize the TRIZ way of problem solving into a much
  simpler procedure for industrial applications. I believe this was in fact
  achieved by USIT (&quot;Unified Structured Inventive Thinking&quot;), which was
  developed by Ed Sickafus in 1995 at Ford. USIT is explained in my ETRIA paper,
  and in full detail in my paper to be presented at the coming TRIZCON2002. </p>
  <p>(7) Essence of TRIZ philosophy and simplified TRIZ/USIT procedure should be
  taught and applied to real problems, not in a hurrying-forcing strategy but in
  &quot;Slow-but-Steady Strategy&quot;. </p>
  <p>Hoping that many more people understand the essence of TRIZ and use TRIZ in
  their real problem solving.</p>
  <p>Best wishes, <br>

  <p>Hello Ellen,</p>
  <p>I just read the interesting article &quot;If TRIZ is such a good idea&quot; and I
  recognised several of the issues posted. Apperantly there's been a lively
  discussion on it somewhere (where?) but perhaps another point of view would be
  interested. I'm not sure if you're the proper person to send this to, or if I
  had better send it elsewhere. Let me know if it's proper to send it elsewhere.</p>
  <p>Use these lyrics as you see fit,</p>
  <p>Cheers,<br>

  <blockquote>
    <p>As a (rather creative) engineer, I've been lurking around the TRIZ
    community for a few years, with peaks of time investment every now and then.
    Even after reading a few books and quite a few articles in triz-journal, I
    still consider myself a beginner in TRIZ. `Why is that?' you may wonder.</p>
    <p>As I see it, there's no training path of any kind. Sure, the 40
    principles are straight enough, I've even implemented them on
    trizard.sourceforge.net; but I cannot seem to get beyond that. The S-field
    analysis for example, has a rather strong appeal to me, but even though I've
    searched for introductions for a few years, I've only been able to find
    articles that were less than self-explanatory. I looked for such articles on
    triz-journal.com, and articles published there can be perfectly useful if
    they summarise things already known, but not to the newcomer. That's not an
    attack on those articles, merely a comment that no explicit introductions
    seem available. In spite the clear desire to share knowledge that lives in
    the community.</p>
    <p>What I would need, would be a clear learning path, perhaps an independent
    one for different TRIZ tools. Also, an overview of available tools would be
    rather helpful, as well as an overview of books, and how they should be
    considered in a learning trajectory. In other words, I need what educational
    people call a curriculum.</p>
    <p>I happen to be someone who learns well from reading and fiddling around
    with things myself, but I am well aware that others have a learning
    preference targeted at practice. Those people would be greatly helped with
    workshops and courses. And if it is up to me, those need not be formal at
    all. I would enjoy spending an evening a week at a local `TRIZ community
    gathering' where people of varying levels of experience come together and
    try to crack some problem. Not necessarily for the solution, but for the
    sheer fun, as well as to learn to use TRIZ. When learning is like play (and
    need not be planned with marketing etc) it works best. I only wonder if TRIZ
    has sufficient touch base in the world to make that happen. Those who live
    near Enschede/Netherlands are quite welcome to contact me!</p>

  <p>Dear Rick van Rein: </p>
  <p>The discussion that got us the comments on &quot;IF TRIZ is so good&quot; was on the
  e-mail discussion group. Go to www.topica.com, use their search engine to find
  TRIZ, and join the discussion group. You will get occasional e-mails, and the
  opportunity to answer the whole group, or the person who posted it. </p>
  <p>Yes, I'm the right person to send your comment to. May I publish it (along
  with some others--so far I have one comment from a group of several people in
  the UK) in our May issue? </p>
  <p>In addition, as editor of the TRIZ Journal and a person who does seminars
  and consulting in TRIZ as a business, I agree with you. The small comfort I
  can offer is to that it is better now than it was 8 years ago, when there was
  one (really badly translated) book available in English, one in German, so if
  you didn't read Russian, you were out of luck!!</p>
  <p>I am thinking about doing a beginners' section for the TRIZ Journal, with a
  curriculum and a set of tutorial articles. Your comment will help persuade me
  to stop talking about doing it, and actually do it. </p>
  <p>There are several TRIZ discussion groups that I know about--one in
  Minneapolis, MN, USA, and one in the Midlands, in the UK, and one in Los
  Angeles, USA. Perhaps your comment will starte one in NL!</p>
  <p>Re Su-Field analysis--I prefer functional analysis, and almost never use
  Su-Field analysis, unless the client specifically wants to learn classical
  TRIZ. See Zinovy Royzen's article on TOP in Sept. 99 TRIZ Journal and John
  Terninko's in Feb. 2000. For Functional Analysis, see any systems engineering
  textbook. </p>
  <p>Hope this helps! And please let me know if I can publish your letter.</p>
