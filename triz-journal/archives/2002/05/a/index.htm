<p>The Advanced Institute of Technology of the Samsung Corporation has
recognized the work of Nikolay Shpakovsky with a very significant corporate
award. </p>

</font>
<p>The savings of 120 billion won is the equivalent of US$ 91,200,000. </p>
<p>Nikolay described the TRIZ training being done at Samsung, for more than 2000
employees, at the ETRIA meeting and in his paper in the December 2001 TRIZ
Journal. Samsung has generously agreed to allow Nikolay and his colleagues to
share their training methods with the TRIZ community through a series of
articles that will appear throughout the year. </p>
<p>When the editors asked if we could publish the announcement of the award,
Nikolay asked if he could add the following note, about the people who
contributed to all the TRIZ work at Samsung:</p>
<p>“This award was undoubtedly a pleasant surprise to me. I am happy to have
made that contribution to our TRIZ thriftbox , which is a weighty proof of the
TRIZ efficiency. During all my work I had to solve problems of different degree
of complexity, to turn aside patents and to forecast the evolution of technical
systems. It is interesting enough that the simplest problems that arise in mass
production generally turn out to be difficult to solve. This is because there
are certain limitations; it is necessary to remove a disadvantage practically
without changing anything in the production process. That is, it is necessary to
apply to the full extent the TRIZ approach according to which <i>everything
remains as it was, but the disadvantage is removed . </p>
</i>
<p>“I am certainly grateful to the management of Samsung Advanced Institute of
Technology. This is not only a natural feeling of gratitude for the award, but
the expression of respect for the far-seeing and forethoughtful people who
discerned the possibility of getting high profits by using TRIZ and provided for
the efficient work of TRIZ specialists. </p>
<p>“It is quite natural that such the appreciation of my work is the merit of
our entire group working for Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology. First of
all I would like to thank the TRIZ specialist from Sankt-Petersburg Vasily
Leniashin, who has been my workfellow for some years. I confirm with great
pleasure his active participation in solving many of the problems and I am
grateful to him for efficient cooperation. In addition to problem solving we
actively work on perfecting the TRIZ methodology in order to tie it up to the
full extent to the process of solving real production problems (see our article
published in your journal http://www.triz-journal.com/archives/2002/01/f/index.htm).</p>
<p>“I also think it appropriate to recognize the great personal contribution of
Nikolay Khomenko who was the first to start teaching TRIZ to Korean specialists
and who continues this work today. It is necessary to make mention of Dmitry
Kucheryavy, why developed and confirmed this first success by practical
consulting work for LG. I also express my gratitude to other TRIZ specialists
who successfully work today here, in Suwon. They are, first of all, Peter
Chuksin and Alexander Skuratovich from Minsk, Valery Chernyak from Sankt-Petersburg
and many other Russian and Korean specialists working mainly for LG and SAMSUNG.
This is just owing to their work that the atmosphere of cooperation in the
development of TRIZ methodology was created here and the Korean Group of TRIZ
study was formed with the professor of Korean Polytechnic University Young-Il
Kim at its head. The group unites over 120 representatives of production
companies, research institutes and universities from different regions of
Korea.”</p>
