<p>If you have read articles on TRIZ by me before you will know that one thing I
like to do is apply TRIZ to everyday life. I have reported in previous journals
ideas relating to TRIZ and decorating. I would now like to take you through the
journey I made with TRIZ and design for redecorating my whole house, a journey
which entails an increasing use of TRIZ room by room, until in the end we had
(my son and I) some firm ideas about TRIZ and design which really works!</p>
<p>In the earlier article we were using TRIZ simply to solve technical problems,
like removing wallpaper, applying paint using unusual resources like an oil can,
and getting paint lines to look straight (by using TRIZ Principle Segmentation,
if you create a line which is non-uniform - spots say - then the line looks more
straight than if it is continuous).</p>
<p>But basically the design of the room was fairly standard, though we did
choose to use external light (a bright green from trees outside) to enhance the
colour readmitted from the wall paper.</p>
<p>In the second room, a bedroom, we chose to segment the colours more, so the
lower walls were a darker green than the upper walls, and the rugs were also a
matching green. For the next bedroom we were ready to apply Trend of evolution
to a greater extent. The segmentation of colours was still applied to upper and
lower walls, but this time the lines of separation on each wall were complex
curves, running from ceiling downwards, leaving a gap and then from floor back
up with a slightly different curve. This continued around the room. The
interesting effect was to lessen what could have been an over dominant red in
the lower part of the wall.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="e01.jpg" width="369" height="277"></p>
<p>The next room was a small bedroom which was to be converted to the office but
without losing the potential to put a small double bed in for guests on
occasions. As this presented greater contradictions for use of space this would
provide more opportunities for TRIZ.</p>
<p>The first function tackled was the design of the bookshelves. They had to
store a lot of books and papers and office stuff but they must not take up too
much room.</p>
<p>Combining Principles of Asymmetry, Segmentation, Another Dimension led to the
making of the main shelves as an A frame between two walls, with either leg of
the frame resting against the outer wall. This meant that the main structure was
mostly self-supporting and was very easy to make. Instead of many uprights to
hold the weight of shelves, all needing to be secured, the system was mostly
self-standing. Shelves inside the A frame were put at different heights
(segmentation and non-uniformity) as were the shelves resting on the outer
frame. Not only did this make the whole structure need far fewer securing points
it also looked great (well, beauty is in the eye of the beholder perhaps). But
best of all, because books and papers are all different sizes the storage space
in the shelving system was much greater. The usual gaps that occur above small
books put on deep shelves was not evident. In fact the system stored so much
that space was left over after storing all the stuff that had previously been
put on the same shelves in an upright rectangular design.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="e02.jpg" width="369" height="277"></p>
<p>The A frame shape suggested a new segmentation of colours for lower and upper
walls. The darker colour was again chosen for the lower wall and painted as a
repeated tooth shape around the walls (the tooth shape came from the inner A
shape with the top cut short). The computer desk was made to match this shape as
triangular shelving on the far wall. At that height is also allowed a bed to be
placed under it but not completely covering the bed end, so making it easy to
get in out of the bed.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="e03.jpg" width="369" height="277"></p>
<p>So by choosing to use other dimensions and other angles than right angles we
had maximised use of space and creating some interesting visual effects.</p>
<p>The final room reworked was the kitchen. Here we had even more contradictions
because there was more functionality required. Asymmetry, other dimensions,
local quality and segmentation helped create a novel design.</p>
<p>The first decision was to place almost all of the function of storage in one
place, so the end of the kitchen became one large floor to ceiling cupboard.</p>
<p>The wide upright struts enabled us to use the width of the struts to allow
curved cuts in the doors without revealing gaps between them. The gap line
wavered, plant like, from floor to ceiling.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="e04.jpg" width="369" height="277"></p>
<p>By placing most of the functional storage in these cupboards there were no
other cupboards on the walls and so the sense of roominess increased
considerably. There remained the issue of worktop space. One worktop was simply
a curved piece of maple. That was an easy decision, replicating the curves of
the cupboard doors. The second worktop area was around the sink.</p>
<p>The usual rectangular sink and draining board would not fit the design at
all, and also seemed to use space which at times had a different function.</p>
<p>At times the area could be used for preparing food and at other times for
washing the dishes and such like. We did not think it too easy to segment the
sink in time, sometimes being there and sometimes not, as that would require
some very quick fit plumbing! But we could segment the use of the worktop area
in time, sometimes being a clear area for preparing food and sometimes being an
area for washing up.</p>
<p>So the draining board could be moveable. We decided that a simple large tray
would suffice, being there to protect the worktop from metal damaging the
surface, but removable to under the sink when not in use.</p>
<p>This enabled us to have a very simple round sink and a clean and clear
worktop area.</p>
<p>To finish the design the tiling behind the sink worktop was of matching
colours but the tiles were of two sizes, very large and very small, which
allowed us to play with the patterns to fill in the space and make it
non-uniform, more like a work of art!</p>
<p>There were many other uses of TRIZ in the practical �how to do it� world of
building the worktop and cupboards and the required plumbing. But the suggestion
is that it was the use of TRIZ in thinking about design that was most fruitful.</p>
<p>It was not that we would not have seen some of the ideas in magazines and
such like, but TRIZ gave us the courage to explore the ideas systematically, and
as we did so we got more and more willing to take risks with the design. This is
one of the major benefits of using TRIZ. Maybe you could use other approaches to
solving the problems and contradictions, but with TRIZ you can be confident
about the kinds of decisions that TRIZ suggests.</p>

<p>TRIZ and design</p>
</b>
<p>Good design is about combining good functionality with good aesthetics.
Fortunately when using TRIZ these seem to go together.</p>
<p>Any parameter, or feature, can be segmented, shifted in dimensions, made more
non-uniform, moving from straight lines to curves and complex curves.</p>
<p>Increased use of asymmetry not only seems to look better but usually supplies
more possibilities of functionality, with some parts able to deliver different
functions to other parts.</p>
<p>It is easy to use any of the 40 Principles as a �What if?� question, and
combining these with separation in time or space, trends towards non-uniformity
and complexity, using Ideality to guide choices, we can have a lot more fun and
come up with ideas which we can trust will be heading in the right direction.</p>
<p>The more I use TRIZ in an easy way, just for everyday decisions, the more I
trust that it works. People seeing the design decisions we have made through the
house are making very positive comments, including that they are not so sure
they would be so brave! Well, when we started we were not so brave either. So
now it is back to the first room to see what might be done to develop that room!</p>
<p>All comments welcome.</p>
