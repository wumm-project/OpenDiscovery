<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Abstract</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several methods of modeling systems are common in TRIZ for
problem solving, system simplification, and improvement. Subject - Action-
Object models are based on specific physical components of a system and the
explicit effects they exert on other components of the system, and are derived
from the Su-field modeling method of classical TRIZ. “Operational” models,
generally known as “problem formulator” models, allow broader definition of a
system’s elements to include actions as well as components. Both models focus on
whether those elements ultimately contribute useful or harmful effects to the
primary purpose of the system or to elements supporting that purpose.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no direct way of using these models to deal with
time-variable elements in the system model, or to deal with different aspects of
a problem that occur at different levels of the system. Most TRIZ teachers
emphasize the need to clearly identify the problems at each level of the system,
and to solve them separately. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Causal loop models are useful in TRIZ to identify the system
elements and actions in a system that are most pertinent to causing a desired
change in performance, and add a powerful ability to understand the time
dependence of conflicts. Organizing the views of the problem in a hierarchy of
macro-performance, trends and patterns, accumulation of discrete results, and
discrete events also clarifies the situation and makes the solution space more
accessible. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Canadian agricultural problem will be used to illustrate
these issues. Flax straw from plants grown to produce seeds for oil is extremely
tough material. Deciding whether to burn the straw, sell it for use as fiber or
in wood-substitute products, or use it to feed cattle requires that farmers make
many time-dependent and condition-dependent decisions to survive in the highly
variable economic and physical environment in which they function.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. INTRODUCTION</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All TRIZ processes include a stage usually called “analysis
of the zones of conflict,” which emphasizes understanding the situation in
detail in time, space, and circumstances. Altshuller made it clear that TRIZ
analysis must reflect the nature of the real world:</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“Complicated? Yes, indeed. The world in which we live is
constructed in a complicated way. And if we want to learn about it and transform
it, our thinking must reflect this world correctly. The complex, dynamic,
dialectically developing world should find in our consciousness its full model
which is complex, dynamic, and dialectically developing.”</i> (1) </p>

  <font FACE="MS Mincho" LANG="JA">

</font></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the first paper of this series, we examined the use of
various functional analysis and modeling techniques (2), and found that the
techniques which model the time dependence of a situation gave more useful
suggestions for solving the problem than the static, or time-independent models.
The time graphs in the Product Analysis module of Invention Machine’s
TechOptimizer™, D. Mann’s essay on functional analysis (3, 4), and P. Apte and
D. Mann’s work on non-linear problems (5) all suggest a growing awareness of the
importance of time-dependence in modeling a system, before applying any of the
TRIZ methods to solving the system’s problems. Likewise, the popularity of A.
Seredinski’s (6) and D. Mann’s (3) system operator work show the awareness of
the need to look at a problem from the perspective of time sequence and the
magnitude of time intervals for complete understanding of the system. </p>

</font></b>
<p>Experienced TRIZ practioners have always done time-dependent real world
system modeling as part of the preliminary analysis of a situation, but they
have not created tools for TRIZ beginners to use to develop these insights.
Rantanen and Domb (7) introduce the metaphor of Scylla and Charybdis from
classical mythology to emphasize that a problem may have radically different
nature at different times-Odysseus had different problems before, during, and
after sailing between the monster and the whirlpool. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only the highest level of ideal solution will resolve
problems from all the time zones simultaneously. <i>The ideal system doesn’t
exist, but performs all its functions.</i> Neglecting to model the time
relationships will lead to sub-optimum, sub-ideal solutions that may only
perform some of the functions, in some of the time zones. Experiments with
time-dependent causal loop models (8, 9, 10, 11, 12) demonstrate that a
hierarchy of levels of analysis of a system under study will make the TRIZ
problem solving opportunities much clearer.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.3 Agricultural case study: Management of Flax Straw.</p>
  <font FACE="MS Mincho" LANG="JA">
</dir>
</font></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to explore these modeling systems with a real case
study, the problem of flax straw in Saskatchewan Canada was selected.
Agricultural systems are complex, time dependent, and subject to variation
outside the control of the operator (weather, world market prices, investment in
processing facility), but they are fairly easy to explain to audiences with a
wide variety of technical knowledge and experience, as demonstrated in earlier
work on functional analysis models using the no-till farming method (2).</p>

OF THE FLAX CASE: Flax Harvesting and Residual Straw Disposal</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flax (<i>Linum usitatissimum</i>) straw from plants grown to
produce seeds for oil is an extremely tough and durable agricultural by-product.
After harvesting, the straw is accumulated and burned to clear fields. This
requires human labor, equipment and fuel and may cause significant pollution.</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">L. usitatissimum</i> grown for oil is a short (1 - 2 feet)
multi-headed plant. Crops are rotated, as part of disease prevention, on a
(minimum) four year cycle. There is some minor production of special papers and
specialty fibers from the fibers of oil flax plants. In other regions, cultivars
<i>of L. usitatissimum </i>are grown as tall (3 - 4 feet) single headed plants
for fiber to produce fabrics such as linen. See Figure 1. </p>

</font><b>
<p align="left">Figure 1:</b> Picture of Flax oilseed plants, seeds, stems.
Note extensive fibers at the cut.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flax stems do not degrade; they last for years. Plant
segments may carry disease and / or pests from year to year if left in place.
Plant stems are too tough to be cut / chopped in the normally available grain
combine equipment. Stalks can be cut / chopped after combining, but no other
similar need / usage is observed on the farms; hence no multi-purpose equipment
is routinely available.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem occurs through economic choice: It is cheaper (or
at least more traditional), to spend the time and resources to pile or row the
stalks and burn them in the field than it is to find alternate uses for the
stalks as a product (13). See Figure 2. Processing the straw into substitutes
for wood products and using it for cattle feed have emerged as alternatives in
the last few years. See Figures 3a and 3b. These efforts to promote the use and
added value processing of flax straw have recently become more organized in
Saskatchewan (14).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. MODELS FOR THE FLAX CASE </p>
<dir>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.1 Function analysis</p>
</dir>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subject - Action- Object models are based on specific
physical components of a system and the explicit effects they exert on other
components of the system, and are derived from the Su-field modeling method of
classical TRIZ (15, 1, 2). “Operational” models, generally known as “problem
formulator” models, allow broader definition of a system’s elements to include
actions as well as components. Both models focus on whether those elements
ultimately contribute useful or harmful effects to the primary purpose of the
system or to elements supporting that purpose.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.1.1 The Operational Model</p>
</b><font FACE="Batang" LANG="KO"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The operational model (“problem formulator”) for flax farming
is shown in Figure 4. This method is described in Ref. 16 and has been
popularized by Ideation International's Ideation Workbench™ software. Each box
represents either a useful or harmful function, and the arrows between boxes
show relationships; that is, one function can cause or prevent another. A large
number of potential problem statements are generated from this model by
substitution in general formulas such as the following:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Find a way to enhance the useful effect</li>
  <li>Find a way to remove, reduce, or prevent a harmful effect without losing
  the useful effect that is generated by the same process.</li>
  <li>Find an alternate way to create a useful effect</li>
  <li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The TRIZ practioner has to examine the list of potential
problem statements, select the ones that are most appropriate for the situation,
and then re-express them in terms of the language of the situation in order to
begin solving the problem. A sample of these problem statements is shown in
figure 5. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The formulator model is typically created at a single instant
in time. Additional diagrams are created for different time intervals, if
necessary. This leads to development of problem statements that are not
explicitly time dependent. This may make them superficially easier to solve, but
it may not reflect the reality of the system. Note that this modeling system is
not really intended to show multiple alternates. Alternates were forced in this
diagram.</p>

</font><b>
<p align="left">Figure 5</b>. A partial list of the problem statements
generated by the problem formulator, from the diagram in Figure 4. The full list
has 14 problem statements, many of which can be expanded into 4-6 subsidiary
problem statements.</p>
<b>
<p>3.1.2 Functional Model (Subject-Action-Object Model)</p>
</b><font FACE="MS Mincho" LANG="JA"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The function analysis model is based on system engineering
methods of defining a function in terms of two objects and the action that one
performs on the other. The graphical form of function analysis has been
popularized in TRIZ through Invention Machine Co.'s TechOptimizer™ and Creax’s
CreaTRIZ™ as shown in Fig. 6. Solid arrows indicate useful functions, dashed
arrows indicate useful functions that are not operating at their best value
(either too much or too little) and wavy arrows or red arrows indicate harmful
functions. Problem statements are developed directly from the graphics by
examination, for example:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Eliminate harmful functions</li>
  <li>Improve inadequate functions</li>
  <li>Find an alternate way to do beneficial functions.</li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problem statements are also developed through the process of
trimming, such as </p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Delete functions. How can the useful function be performed without another
  function? Or can the result be achieved without the function?</li>
  <li>Delete components. How can the function be transferred to other
  components? Or can it be transferred to resources of the system?</li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, in TechOptimizer, solution statements are developed
by applying a list of generic problem statements, based on the 76 standard
solutions (17) to the function statement. (For a function “A does X to B” there
will be a family of statements such as “You may improve the action X by putting
something between A and B” or “You may eliminate the action X by vibrating B”
etc.) The solution to the problem requires re-formulating these solution
statements for the particular conditions of the problem.</p>

</font><b>
<p align="left">Figure 6</b>. Function analysis model diagram for flax
farming. A function is shown as two components and a linking action. Functions
can be useful or harmful, and useful functions can be adequate or not.</p>
<p>The function analysis model is also typically created at a single instant in
time, with the same consequences as for the operational model; that is, the
problem statements are time-independent, which makes them easier to solve, but
it may not reflect the reality of the system. Again, note that the modeling
system is not really intended to show multiple alternates. Alternates were also
forced in this diagram.</p>

    <b>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.2.1 Need for explicit modeling of time dependence</p>
    </b>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many operational systems include elements or sub-systems that
operate over widely diverse periods of time. In such systems change, or
sometimes the rate of change, of parametric values of the elements of the system
determine functionality. Traditional function analysis models portray static
relations between the elements of a system and offer no means to show that
elements may change the degree of their interactions over time, and may even
have no effect on any other element of a system for significant periods. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For systems in which time dependency dictates functionality,
useful modeling may require explicit portrayal of that time dependency to guide
improvement of the real system. Fortunately various means and methods to develop
and execute these models exist.</p>
<font COLOR="#3366ff"></font><b>
<p>3.2.2</b> <b>Using a Causal Loop modeling system</b> </p>
<font FACE="MS Mincho" LANG="JA"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A causal loop model is shown in Figure 7. This methodology is
based on the systems thinking discipline developed and popularized by Peter
Senge (8, 9). One automated version of this modeling method, the I-Think
Software by High Performance Systems, is described in Reference 10, and is among
several software products available (11). The modeling method utilizes a nouns
and verbs representation of the elements of a system (12). Nouns, represented by
rectangles, are amounts, quantities, accumulations, things, states of being, or
levels, etc. The verbs are activities that cause change, either positive or
negative, in the magnitude (condition) of the nouns. Verbs are shown as
directional pipes or flows, with regulators.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additional graphic elements are useful in representing causal
link model elements. First is the cloud, which can serve as an infinite source
or sink for the noun elements. This allows models to be bounded for
practicality, and allows a focus on sub-systems of particular interest. The
second additional element is an action connector, shown as a solid curvilinear
arrowed line, to show causal linkages, inputs or outputs, between model
elements.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A clear distinction of this modeling system versus those
above is that it not only shows dynamic coupling and linkages, it shows the
changes of importance of the different factors being modeled over time, and
provides for alternate operational paths within a model.</p>

</font><b>
<p align="left">Figure 7</b>. Causal Loop Model of Flax Farming</p>
<font FACE="MS Mincho" LANG="JA"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The result of operating this model, for a particular set of
parametric inputs (acreage, seeding and growing durations, and levels of demand
for both process straw stocks and fodder for livestock) is shown in Figure 8.
These curves clearly demonstrate the variation in strength of causal factors
over time, and may help reveal secondary effects not previously perceived.</p>

</font><b>
<p align="left">Figure 8.</b> Output of the Causal Loop Model</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This model output in Figure 8 makes it very clear that
different problems need to be solved at different times in the year, and under
different circumstances. Noise factors, outside the control of the farmer, have
considerable influence on the outcome of the process. Such noise factors include
rain, other weather conditions, and the market for both the flax seed and the
straw. The farmer can influence, although not fully control, certain other
factors such as soil moisture and soil fertility. The problems to be solved and
the relationships between the solutions can be explored over a range of time and
noise factors. See Figure 9. </p>

    <p>3.2.2 Need for complete modeling of time dependence at different levels?</p>
    </b>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Review of the modeling results above showed that even if
complete data existed about variations in environmental factors, market
conditions, straw and oil demand, etc, to make decisions in a single year
context, other conditions / constraints that operate over a multi-year horizon
control many decision points. Constraints of crop rotation programs, available
acreage, market demand for other crops, all combine with multiple assumptions
about anticipated market demand months and years in advance of actual commitment
to a planting program. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to effectively model a system which actually
operates over a multi-year cycle, it is necessary to change the level of detail,
and include system elements at a greater level of aggregation for decision
making. These models continue to be developed.</p>
<b>
<p>3.3. The hierarchy of models of the system</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="06.gif" width="399" height="288"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Figure 10: </b>A pictorial representation of the hierarchy of
models of systems. There is continuum of complexity levels ranging from discrete
events (typically of short duration) through the accumulation of discrete
events, to the developments of trends and patterns (typically over longer
periods of time, since several cycles of accumulation are necessary to begin to
see a pattern) to the macro-performance level, at which the system dynamics and
relationships can be seen over an extended time period, and in relationship to
the time-varying performance of the external environment.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Figure 10 shows the pictorial representation of the hierarchy
of complexity and duration that describes the nature of system models (8, 9, 10,
11). This representation is reminiscent of the System Operator (3, 4, 5) and
somewhat reminiscent of the DTC (Dimension/Time/Cost) Operator in TRIZ (1). It
is possible to build valid models of the system at each level, but until models
are built at all levels, the performance of the system over time and in the
functioning environment won’t be effectively represented.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Altshuller’s definition of a system can be used at each of
the 4 principal levels of the hierarchy:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tool</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Object</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Energy by which the tool affects the object</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Transmission by which the energy is linked to the objects</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Guidance and control method, by which the system functions.</li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Table 1 shows that systems, using Altshuller’s definition,
are operating at each of the levels of the hierarchy. The reader can easily
create several more levels between each of the levels shown. Complexity
increases over the continuum; the four levels were introduced for convenience of
discussion. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. CONCLUSION</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">None of the conclusions reached in this study will surprise
experienced TRIZ practioners and TRIZ teachers. The tools, techniques, and
methods demonstrated here for organizing information may be useful to all who
try to apply TRIZ to complex situations. The application of several kinds of
modeling methods to the problem of the Saskatchewan farmer making the decision
about how to remove flax straw from the field has demonstrated the following:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The more depth and breadth of modeling, in dimensions of
  time, space, economics, society, energy, etc., the more choices about the
  solution level as well as the solution itself will be developed.</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ tools, such as function analysis models
  (subject-action-object models and formulator models) are useful at many
  levels, but each individual model should be created at only one level. Not
  shown in this paper, but suggested by many people who have tried this, is the
  use of a map (tree diagram or table) for organizing the models and keeping
  track of the TRIZ problems and solutions associated with each level.</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tools from other disciplines that specifically incorporate
  time dependencies can be added to the TRIZ “toolbox” easily, to aid in
  developing the insight necessary to formulate the TRIZ problems.</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Altshuller’s 5-element system model is useful at all levels
  of complexity, to define the system at that level. In use, it is an excellent
  facilitation tool to help teams develop common definitions of the operating
  elements and flows of energy and information in their system. People who have
  been using the formulator model diagram or the subject-action-object diagram
  as facilitation tools will find this table to be a useful supplement. The
  table of model hierarchy may be particularly helpful when there is a
  de-coupling or shift in the very nature of an element of Altshuller’s model as
  the hierarchy levels change.</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new problem may be encountered, at a high level of
  complexity, when the very act of observing / improving large and time
  distributed systems changes the situation, while the system is operating. </li>
</ol>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The richness of TRIZ has expanded in the past as techniques
were imported from value engineering, system engineering, and strategic planning
methodologies. That richness will continue to expand both as more methods are
used to increase the depth and breadth of problems that TRIZ addresses and as
the ease of using the TRIZ methods increases the variety of people who can
benefit from TRIZ.</p>
