<P>By <A href="#authors">Kai Yang</A></P><H2>Abstract</H2><P>The 36 strategies are a collection of some of the most subtle and counter-intuitive strategies developed in ancient China in the past three millenniums covering the fields of politics, diplomacy, espionage and business operations. There are some striking similarities among the 36 strategies and the inventive principles of the <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c070326a.asp">Theory of Inventive Problem Solving</A> (TRIZ). Both strive to derive solutions for difficult problems that maximize total benefits while minimizing costs and harmful side effects. In this paper, the 36 strategies are described in detail with TRIZ comparisons using the strategies developed in ancient China.<A href="#Ref15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> The application of the 36 strategies and TRIZ in non-technical areas are also discussed with similarities and differences.</P><H2>Introduction</H2><P>The <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c080428a.asp">40 inventive principles</A> and the <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c080428a.asp">contradiction matrix</A> compiled by the founder of TRIZ, Genrich Altshuller, and his colleagues are some of the tools used in TRIZ.<A href="#Ref1"><SUP>1</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> Theory of Inventive Problem Solving research started with the study of patents; therefore, most TRIZ principles and methods are based on knowledge accumulated in technological areas. Many researchers, however, have studied how to extend TRIZ to non-technical areas. Since the 1970s, there have been continuous efforts made by TRIZ researchers to extend TRIZ into non-technical areas.<A href="#Ref19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> There are now 40 inventive business principles and 40 inventive principle analogies of TRIZ in the context of software and computing.<A href="#Ref5"><SUP>5</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref7"><SUP>7</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> The 40 inventive principles have also been adapted for service operation management, quality management and education.<A href="#Ref8"><SUP>8</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref11"><SUP>11</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> </P><P>Several researchers have also tried to link and compare inventive TRIZ principles with other existing strategies and approaches in non technical areas, including comparing the 40 inventive principles with Medieval Latin phrases.<A href="#Ref12"><SUP>12 </SUP></A>There have been discussions about several of the ancient 36 strategies written in Chinese literature and a comparison of some of the analects of Confucius with TRIZ thinking.<A href="#Ref4"><SUP>4</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> The purpose of the latter research was to try to discover whether there are common links among "fundamental and universal principles of human wisdom and creativity" from different schools of thoughts.<A href="#Ref12"><SUP>12</SUP></A></P><P>There are similarities among the 36 strategies and author Sun Tzu's book <EM>The Art of War</EM>, which focuses on military organization, leadership and battle field tactics.<A href="#Ref3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> The 36 strategies are more suitable in the field of politics, diplomacy, espionage and business operations. </P><P>The term, 36 strategies, was first mentioned in the <EM>Book of Southern Qi</EM> in its seventh biographical volume, <EM>Biography of Wang Jingze</EM>, which is a history of the Chinese dynasty, Southern Qi. It covers the period from 479 to 502 AD. The only existing known hard copy that describes the original 36 strategies was discovered in 1941; it is a brief book.<A href="#Ref14"><SUP>14</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> Though this book was printed in 1941 (by an unknown author) it is believed that the original version of this book was written some time during the Ming Dynasty (AD 1368–1644) or Qing Dynasty (1644–1911). </P><P>Stefan H. Verstappan and H. von Senger are the authors who introduced the 36 strategies to the Western world.<A href="#Ref15"><SUP>15</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> There are many sources for these 36 strategies, they include: <EM>I Ching Book of Change</EM> and <EM>Art of War</EM>; some of the sources of the 36 strategies date back to the Ming Dynasty<SUP>.</SUP><A href="#Ref3"><SUP>3</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> </P><P>The main objective of the 36 strategies is described in the summary section of the <EM>The Thirty Six Strategies</EM>: "There are many issues in warfare, such as strengthening armed forces, choosing officers, planning the wars, etc., we can certainly follow some standard practices. But there will be infinite variations, surprises, uncertainties when war really happens, 36 strategies can be tried out to deal with all that whenever you are in advantageous or disadvantageous position."<A href="#Ref17"><SUP>17</SUP></A></P><H2>Thirty-six Strategies </H2><P>The description of the 36 strategies is based on the Biography of Wang Jingze.<A href="#Ref17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> The original version of the book, however, discusses the 36 strategies mostly in the context of Chinese histories and classics. The author will describe these strategies in a more general fashion with modern day examples. For each strategy, if it is similar or somewhat related to certain inventive TRIZ principles, they will be listed. </P><P>The preface of the 36 strategies states: "Six times six equals thirty six, calculations produce tactics and tactics yield more calculations. Based on this correlative relationship, ploys and strategies are devised. Strategies can never be prescribed without adjustments; rigid application of theory will result in failure."<A href="#Ref17"><SUP>17</SUP></A></P><P>The 36 strategies are divided into six sections/strategies:</P><OL><LI>Winning <LI>Enemy dealing <LI>Attacking <LI>Chaos <LI>Proximate <LI>Defeat </LI></OL><P>In the first three sections, the decision makers have an advantageous position and in the second three sections, the decision makers have a disadvantageous position. </P><H2>Winning Strategies</H2><H2>Strategy 1: Court the Emperor to Cross the Sea <IMG height=18 alt="" src="http://www.triz-journal.com/library/graphics/2010-01-02(1).gif" width=75 border=0></H2><P>This strategy is based on a Chinese legend. Around 600 AD (after death), the Chinese emperor wanted to attack Korea, but he was not confident to bring all the troops through the sea, his top general decorated big ships like "fun ships" with wine and a party and the emperor sailed through the sea in calm. </P><P>In <EM>The Thirty Six Strategies</EM> it further explains that the strategy involves camouflage, ordinary camouflage schemes (such as moving troops in dark and shadows) that are easy to be detected. If an individual can act in open and hide his true intentions under the guise of common every day activities he will be much more effective. </P><H3>Key points</H3><OL><LI>Use of camouflage. <LI>Disguise difficult objects or goals or intents with ordinary, normal, nice things.</LI></OL><H3>Examples</H3><UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px"><LI>Spies <LI>White House state dinner crashers, Tareq and Michaele Salahi, allegedly attended a state dinner at the White House by pretending they were ordinary invitees in November 2009. <LI>Police cars disguised as ordinary cars. <LI>Gummy-bear-like vitamin pills. <LI>Disney theme park pre-shows at rides/exhibits for customers to make long waiting lines less stressful.</LI></UL><H3>Relevant TRIZ Principles</H3><UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px"><LI>Principle 24: <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c061027a.asp#Endnote1">Intermediary</A> <LI>Principle 32: <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c070409a.asp">Color change</A> <LI>Principle 33: <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c070813a.asp">Homogeneity</A></LI></UL><P>The TRIZ principle color change is relevant because color can be used as a camouflage. The homogeneity principle is somewhat relevant because it states that it makes "objects by interacting with a given object of the same material." For the first strategy it is important to make things look ordinary and normal so they have some similar elements. The intermediary principle is somewhat relevant because it states that it can use an intermediate carrier article or merge one object temporarily with another (which can be easily removed). These methods can serve the need for the first strategy well under some circumstances. </P><H2>Strategy 2: Besiege Wei to Rescue Zhao <IMG height=18 alt="" src="http://www.triz-journal.com/library/graphics/2010-01-02(2).gif" width=75 border=0></H2><P>In 354 BC, (before Christ) China was in a Warring States period; the Wei state launched a full force attack on the Zhao state. Zhao was asking its ally, the Qi state, for help. One renowned strategist of the Qi state, Sun Bin (Sun Tzu's descendent) proposed not to directly confront the strong Wei army, but launched another attack on the Wei's capital. This forced the Wei to withdraw to save its capital from sacking. This strategy used smaller forces and was much less costly.</P><H3>Key points</H3><OL><LI>Avoid costly brute force confrontation when the opponent is too strong, but attack its most vulnerable and fatal weakness. <LI>No matter how strong an enemy is, there are usually some weaknesses. Find the weaknesses so that an individual can win with minimum cost. <LI>Avoid "straight line" way of thinking – a "winding" strategy could be much less costly and more effective. <LI>Use the right tool to solve the right problems. </LI></OL><P>The fourth point in <EM>The Thirty Six Strategies</EM> further explains that: "You cannot solve a puzzle by using fist, you cannot resolve a conflict by taking side and participating the fight."</P><H3>Example</H3><P>In fighting floods, sometimes it is too difficult to reinforce dams instead selectively flood the water to less populated places. </P><H3>Relevant TRIZ Principles </H3><UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px"><LI>Principle 2: Taking out <LI>Principle 3: Local quality <LI>Principle 12: Equal potentiality <LI>Principle 14: Curvature </LI></UL><H2>Strategy 3: Kill with a Borrowed Knife <IMG height=18 alt="" src="http://www.triz-journal.com/library/graphics/2010-01-02(3).gif" width=75 border=0></H2><H3>Key points</H3><OL><LI><FONT size=2>Damage or eliminate the opponent by using the force of others. </FONT><LI><FONT size=2>Damage the opponent in an indirect manner without drawing negative effects. </FONT><LI><FONT size=2>Use third party or other means to accomplish the job without cost.</FONT></LI></OL><H3>Examples</H3><UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px"><LI><FONT size=2>Enemy's enemy is the friend.</FONT> <LI><FONT size=2>Using insects to fight harmful insects.</FONT> <LI><FONT size=2>To prevent pollutants, exhaust gas from thermal power stations is treated with alkaline chemicals.

Keep yourself calm and orderly, well fed, well rested, to await chaotic, exhausted and confused enemy."</FONT></P><H3>Key points</H3><OL><LI><FONT size=2>Avoid opponent's peak strength, use defense to consume opponent's energy.</FONT> <LI><FONT size=2>Use calm as an advantage. </FONT><LI><FONT size=2>Choose the right time, place and condition to fight.</FONT></LI></OL><H3>Examples</H3><UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px"><LI><FONT size=2>Do not try to do things first, but be a quick learner to save resources and avoid mistakes.</FONT> <LI><FONT size=2>Delay tactics in negotiation.</FONT></LI></UL><H3>Relevant TRIZ Principles</H3><UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px"><LI><FONT size=2>Principle 11: Beforehand cushioning </FONT><LI><FONT size=2>Principle 12: Equal potentiality</FONT> <LI><FONT size=2>Principle 13: The other way around</FONT> <LI><FONT size=2>Principle 39: Calm atmosphere</FONT></LI></UL><H2>Strategy 5: Loot a Burning House (Exploitation of Plight) <IMG height=18 alt="" src="http://www.triz-journal.com/library/graphics/2010-01-02(5).gif" width=75 border=0></H2><P><FONT size=2>In the <EM>Art of War</EM>, Sun Tzu described: </FONT><FONT size=2>"Now, when your army is exhausted and your resources are spent, this is the time that new opponents enter the field to take advantage of your weakness.

It shares the same line of thinking as Strategy 5 on acting on the most advantageous situation and timing. Principle 11 is somewhat relevant because it states that "preparing emergency means beforehand to compensate for the relatively low reliability of an object," it shares the same thought with strategy five on "preparing emergency means." </FONT></P><H2>Strategy 6: Make a Sound in the East, Attack in the West <IMG height=18 alt="" src="http://www.triz-journal.com/library/graphics/2010-01-02(6).gif" width=75 border=0></H2><P><FONT size=2>In any battle the element of surprise can provide an overwhelming advantage.

They were placed in an area to lead Germany to believe that the actual large scale invasion would take place in Pas de Calais. The air defense in this area was at a minimum to allow Luftwaffe to photograph them easily. Allied naval bombardment was focused on Pas de Calais instead of Normandy. Dummy paratroopers were also used to create further uncertainty on the German side regarding the actual location of the invasion. This led the German defense forces into disorder and allowed the Normandy operation to be carried out with relative ease. </P></LI></UL><H3>Relevant TRIZ Principles</H3><UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px"><LI><FONT size=2>Principle 2: Taking out</FONT> <LI><FONT size=2>Principle 3: Local quality</FONT> <LI><FONT size=2>Principle 6: Universality</FONT></LI></UL><H2>Strategy 9: Observing the Fire on the Opposite Shore (Wait to See Enemies Fight Each Other Out and Keep Uninvolved) <IMG height=18 alt="" src="http://www.triz-journal.com/library/graphics/2010-01-02(9).gif" width=75 border=0></H2><H3>Key points</H3><OL><LI><FONT size=2>Delay entering the field of battle until all other players have become exhausted fighting then go in full strength and pick up the pieces.</FONT> <LI><FONT size=2>Play the competition to an individual's advantage.</FONT></LI></OL><H3>Examples </H3><UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px"><LI><FONT size=2>British politician and anti-communist, Winston Churchill, waited to see Joseph Stalin (general secretary of the Communist Party) and Adolf Hitler (leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party) battle.</FONT> <LI><FONT size=2>Bidding war; open bid to get the best deal.</FONT></LI></UL><H3>Relevant TRIZ Principles</H3><P><FONT size=2>This strategy is consistent with TRIZ ideas of "optimal use of resource" and "use of other's resources and knowledge to our advantages." </FONT></P><H2>Strategy 10: Hiding the Dagger Behind a Smile <IMG height=18 alt="" src="http://www.triz-journal.com/library/graphics/2010-01-02(10).gif" width=75 border=0></H2><H3>Key points</H3><OL><LI><FONT size=2>Charming outside, firm inside. </FONT><LI><FONT size=2>Destruction covered by a charming offensive.</FONT></LI></OL><H3>Examples</H3><UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px"><LI><FONT size=2>Iron hand within a velvet glove.</FONT> <LI><FONT size=2>Stick and carrot. </FONT></LI></UL><H3>Relevant TRIZ Principles</H3><UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px"><LI><FONT size=2>Taking out</FONT> <LI><FONT size=2>Local quality</FONT></LI></UL><H2>Strategy 11: Sacrifice the Plum Tree in Place of the Peach <IMG height=18 alt="" src="http://www.triz-journal.com/library/graphics/2010-01-02(11).gif" width=75 border=0></H2><P>There are circumstances where an individual must sacrifice short-term objectives in order to gain the long-term goal.</P><H3>Key points</H3><OL><LI>Take a small sacrifice to avoid a big loss or exchange a big gain. <LI>Sacrifice short-term objectives in order to gain the long-term goal.</LI></OL><H3>Example</H3><P>During the Warring States period in China (476 BC to 221 BC) a general named Mr. Tian in the Qi state often played horse racing games with other noble families.

In one race, Mr. Tien's horses were inferior to his competitor in all classes.

While it is possible for a small force to put up a great fight, in the end it will lose to superior numbers." </P><P>In <EM>The Thirty Six Strategies</EM> this strategy is explained as: "When your side is losing there are only three choices remaining: surrender, compromise or escape. Surrender is complete defeat, compromise is half defeat, but escape is not defeat. As long as you are not defeated, you still have a chance." </P><H3>Key point</H3><P>If it becomes obvious that the current course of action will lead to defeat then retreat and regroup.</P><H3>Relevant TRIZ Principles</H3><P>There are no relevant TRIZ principles.</P><H2>Similarities and Differences Among the Thirty-six Strategies and TRIZ Similarities</H2><P>Though the 36 strategies and TRIZ were created under different situations and cultural backgrounds, the author found some striking similarities, which are described below. </P><H3>Common Goals: Ideal Final Result</H3><P>In TRIZ, ideality is a measure of excellence for technical solutions. <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c080303a.asp">Ideality</A> is defined by the following ratio:</P><P>Ideality = <IMG height=51 alt="" src="http://www.triz-journal.com/library/graphics/2010-01-02(38).gif" width=135 border=0></P><P>The higher the ideality, the better the technical solution is for a particular problem. The ultimate goal for TRIZ is to achieve the <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c061128a.asp">ideal final result</A> (IFR) where costs and harm will be approaching the minimum and benefits will be approaching the maximum. </P><P>In <EM>The Thirty Six Strategies</EM> all the strategies are about looking for solutions that will achieve maximum benefits with minimal costs and harmful side effects. For example, in the third strategy, "Kill with a borrowed knife" and in the seventh strategy, "create something from nothing," both are trying to accomplish a task without any cost and side effects. In the second strategy, "Besiege Wei to rescue Zhao" and in the fifteenth strategy, "lure the tiger down from the mountain," they are both about fighting to win with minimum loss and maximum effectiveness. </P><P>One of the key fundamentals of the 36 strategies can be described by this quote from the <EM>Art of War</EM> by Sun Tzu: "When we fight, the best strategy is to win by intelligence and wisdom, the second is to win by diplomacy then it is to win by battle. The worst strategy is to win by costly city by city fight." </P><P>As described by <EM>The Thirty Six Strategies</EM>, the first 18 strategies are used when decision makers are in advantageous position. An individual can see that these 18 strategies are about "how to win with maximum benefits and with minimal loss and efforts." The second set of the 18 strategies is used when decision makers are in disadvantageous or even dire positions. An individual can see that these strategies are about "how to reverse the situation to win" or "how to avoid failure" with maximum effectiveness and minimal loss. Clearly, achieving maximum ideality are the common goals of both TRIZ and the 40 inventive principles and the 36 strategies. </P><H3>Eye Openers for Unusual Solutions</H3><P>Both TRIZ and the 36 strategies serve as eye openers for unusual solutions for particular situations. The inventive principles of TRIZ are summarized by <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c071119a.asp">past inventions</A> and they are used when a technical or a <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c070129a.asp">non-technical</A> problem faces some difficult-to-solve bottlenecks or contradictions. The application of inventive TRIZ principles is a practice of knowledge and reuse. The application of the 36 strategies has a similar process and purpose. Each strategy is also a summary of past successes. Decision makers would like to reuse the strategy when it fits. </P><H3>Optimal Uses of Resources</H3><P>For both the 36 strategies and TRIZ, optimal uses of resources are one of the most important pillars of their approaches. In the 36 strategies, there are many strategies that deal with how to use other resources, optimal timing and so on. In TRIZ, many strategies on the uses of other resources, ignored resources and creation of resources from wastes are developed.</P><H3>Psychological Inertia</H3><P>For TRIZ, the study of people's psychological inertia is extensive and many thoughts are developed for overcoming people's <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c070409a.asp">psychological inertia</A> in order to develop breakthrough ideas. For the 36 strategies, the enemy's psychological inertia is noticed. Several strategies such as strategies 32, 33 and 34 respectively, take advantage of people's psychological inertia &#150; even to their advantage under some dire situations. </P><H2>Differences</H2><P>There are also several significant differences among the inventive principles of TRIZ and the 36 strategies, summarized as follows:</P><H3>Domains of Knowledge Base</H3><P>The inventive principles of TRIZ, whether the original 40 inventive principles or the newer versions are derived from <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c070226a.asp">patents</A> of various technological fields.<A href="#Ref6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> The purpose of the inventive principles is to serve as a concise, exhaustive list of principles, which are able to summarize "all the tricks" used in the technological inventions documented in patents. When the inventive principles of TRIZ are used in non-technical areas they are mostly customized re-interpretations of principles to various non-technological fields. </P><P>The 36 strategies are derived from 3000 years of theory and practices from ancient battlefield tactics, political and diplomatic practices and psychological warfare. The applications of the 36 strategies are mostly in the area of non technical fields such as politics, diplomacy, espionage and business operations. Unlike TRIZ, the 36 strategies are not formally derived from a massive study of all strategies and there are no claims that it is an exhaustive list of all good strategies. </P><H3>Application Method</H3><P>In TRIZ applications, the inventive principles are usually used in combination with the <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c080428a.asp">contradiction matrix</A>. The problem is first defined as a contradiction and then the search for relevant inventive principles begins to derive specific solutions from them. </P><P>In the 36 strategies, all 36 strategies are divided into six sections:</P><UL><LI>Winning <LI>Enemy dealing <LI>Attacking <LI>Chaos <LI>Proximate <LI>Defeat</LI></UL><P>In the first three sections, the decision makers have an advantageous position and in the second three sections, the decision makers have a disadvantageous position. The application process of the 36 strategies is simply described as "pick and choose the ones that may fit your situation." </P><H3>Degree of Overlapping</H3><P>Based on the author's analysis, out of 36 strategies, 28 strategies are somewhat relevant or share some common element with 29 of the 40 inventive principles of TRIZ. There are eight strategies that have no resemblance with the 40 inventive principles of TRIZ. There are 11 inventive TRIZ principles that are not remotely used in the 36 strategies. </P><P>These 11 inventive TRIZ principles include: </P><UL><LI>Principle 17 <LI>Principle 18 <LI>Principle 19 <LI>Principle 23 <LI>Principle 28 <LI>Principle 29 <LI>Principle 30 <LI>Principle 36 <LI>Principle 37 <LI>Principle 38 <LI>Principle 40</LI></UL><P>By examining these particular principles, it is not difficult to find that almost all these principles are closely linked to modern technological development. Examples include, principle 18 (mechanical vibration) and principle 23 (feedback). </P><P>The eight strategies that are not linked to the 40 inventive principles include: </P><UL><LI>Strategy 9 <LI>Strategy 18 <LI>Strategy 19 <LI>Strategy 23 <LI>Strategy 24 <LI>Strategy 26 <LI>Strategy 28 <LI>Strategy 36</LI></UL><P>Based on the author's preliminary analysis, some of these strategies are related to psychological warfare such as strategies 26, 27, 28, 32, 33 and 34. They are not remotely linked to technological <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c090525a.asp">inventions</A>. Some of them are multiple stage strategies such as strategies 17, 23, and 30, respectively. They are not linked to patents. Some of them emphasize discovering and resolving vital root causes such as strategies 18 and 19. If all the other knowledge bases of TRIZ are included such as use of resources, Su-field analysis, studies of psychological inertia then an individual will find that the degree of overlapping is much greater. Almost all the 36 strategies share some common thoughts with TRIZ. </P><H2>Conclusions</H2><P>In this paper, the 36 strategies from ancient China are thoroughly researched and discussed along with examples of how they overlap with the 40 inventive principles of TRIZ. Both TRIZ and the 36 strategies strive for searching solutions that achieve high <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c071001a.asp">ideality</A> and both the 40 inventive principles of TRIZ and the 36 strategies are eye openers that could help to land unusual, creative and effective solutions for difficult problems. </P><P>There are also significant differences, TRIZ principles are derived as exhaustive principles describing inventive approaches reflected in patents. The 36 strategies include a short list of fabled strategies from 3000 years of ancient Chinese practices in politics, military battle tactics, psychological warfare and human struggle. The 36 strategies can also be applied to modern day business operations, diplomacy and international politics. </P><P>The author's analysis has shown that there are significant overlaps among the 40 inventive principles of TRIZ and the 36 strategies, which underscore the fact that many elements of human wisdom are universal. The author's study also indicates that there are significant distinctions among the 40 inventive principles and the 36 strategies. The 40 inventive principles of TRIZ contain many elements that are not covered by the 36 strategies. The majority of these elements are related to modern <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c070416a.asp">technological developments</A>. The 36 strategies also contain many elements that are not related to the 40 inventive principles. Some of these elements are not related to engineering technology areas. Some of these elements are not related to inventions either, however, they are well planned multiple stage strategies or best practices. If all knowledge bases of TRIZ are included, then there is greater overlap of the 36 strategies with TRIZ.</P><H2>References</H2><OL><LI><A name=Ref1></A>Altshuller, G.
