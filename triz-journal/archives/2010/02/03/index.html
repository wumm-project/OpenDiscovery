<P>By <A href="#authors">Stan Caplan, Michael Tschirhart and Jack Hipple</A></P><H2>Abstract</H2><P>Over the past ten years, there have been several <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c080428a.asp">40 inventive principles</A> lists with examples that illustrate the breadth of Genrich Altshuller's work; the founder of <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c070326a.asp">The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving</A> (TRIZ).<A href="#Ref1"><SUP>1</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref2"><SUP>2</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref3"><SUP>3</SUP></A></P><P>The 40 principles framework has shown its robustness in its ability to capture key inventive examples across many different technologies and businesses. Though the TRIZ methodology has advanced beyond this simple characterization, these principles along with the original <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c080428a.asp">contradictions table</A> both still remain as legitimate problem solving tools. Both tools offer a way to get problem owners to think in terms of overcoming contradictions as opposed to compromising and optimizing. After this basic understanding, they can move on to more sophisticated TRIZ tools and algorithms.</P><P>Human factors and ergonomics are the sciences relating to the relationship among humans and their working environments, including:</P><UL><LI>The equipment that is operated. <LI>The environment it is operated in. <LI>The relationships among humans and the machines and processes they operate. </LI></UL><P>This entire area has become a major area of focus as the population ages and the elderly still need to drive cars, interact with machinery (even as small as a can opener) and see and interpret information on signs. Tasks that are taken for granted such as boarding an airplane or reading a speedometer in a car are not as easy for an elderly person or one with physical limitations such as arthritis. There is a classical contradiction with providing an over-the-counter medicine bottle that is easy to open for an elderly arthritic while at the same time preventing access to the same bottle with a young child that could easily open it. </P><H2>Introduction</H2><P>The authors have developed a list of examples for the 40 principles applied to the area of human factors and ergonomics. This is the area of science and engineering that relates to the relationships among humans and their working environments, including human-machine interfaces. With the arrival of several interfaces in multiple industries, this has become a major engineering challenge. As the population ages, the ability of individuals to access and use devices and systems is compromised by their physical abilities. Many designed systems are not suitable for all people. When a system is designed for one population, it may not be easily used by others. For example, a sophisticated display screen on a state of the art copier may be appropriate for a professional office assistant, but a manager walking by and wanting to make a few black and white copies is overwhelmed by the complexity of the copier. If the screen's display were to change based on the user, then a TRIZ separation principle has been used to resolve the contradiction of the display needing to be simple and uncomplicated. Another example is remote controls for televisions and other electronic devices. The tendency is to design complicated interfaces that can do everything when what is really needed is an interface that is appropriate for the use at that time only for the user.</P><P>In workplace ergonomics, there is a need to learn how to pre-position workplace materials in such a way as to minimize bodily stress in reaching for assembly components (a "do it in advance" TRIZ principle). Designs that minimize the potential negative impact on the worker while increasing productivity demonstrates the time honored TRIZ approach of resolving contradictions rather than finding some kind of optimum condition. </P><P>The following includes TRIZ principles for human factors and ergonomics with an area of science and engineering that relates to the relationships among humans and their working environments, including human-machine interfaces.</P><H3>Principle 1: <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c081208a.asp">Segmentation</A> </H3><P>A.&nbsp;Divide an object into independent parts. </P><UL><LI>Dividing a work process into separate steps. <LI>Segregate primary controls from secondary controls. <LI>Group menu options.</LI></UL><P>B.&nbsp;Make an object easy to disassemble. </P><UL><LI>Modular furniture to avoid injury in transportation.</LI></UL><P>C.&nbsp;Increase the degree of fragmentation or segmentation. </P><UL><LI>Phone numbers divided into perceptual chunks. <LI>Layering of information screens based on what is needed. <LI>Optimizing work processes through individual task analysis.</LI></UL><H3>Principle 2: Taking Out </H3><P>A.&nbsp;Separate an interfering part or property from an object or single out the only necessary part (or property) of an object. </P><UL><LI>Navigation systems using "turn by turn" versus complex maps. <LI>Removing hazardous operations to an isolated location. <LI>Recessed start button to minimize accidental starts. <LI>Progressive disclosure of information.</LI></UL><H3>Principle 3: Local Quality </H3><P>A.&nbsp;Change an object's structure from uniform to non-uniform, change an external environment (or external influence) from uniform to non-uniform. </P><UL><LI>Oversized emergency buttons. <LI>Simplified cell phone panels for people with motor skills problems. </LI></UL><P>B.&nbsp;Make each part of an object function in conditions most suitable for its operation. </P><UL><LI>Specialized setting on websites and software. <LI>Offer different ways to have software provide the same function.</LI></UL><P>C.&nbsp;Make each part of an object fulfill a different and useful function. </P><UL><LI>Individual office design to reflect different ergonomic needs. <LI>Individual televisions on airplanes. <LI>Mouse performs both point and scroll functions.</LI></UL><H3>Principle 4: <A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/content/c081103a.asp">Asymmetry</A> </H3><P>A.&nbsp;Change the shape of an object from symmetrical to asymmetrical. </P><UL><LI>Left and right handed designed products. <LI>One way insertion for two different parts.</LI></UL><P>B.&nbsp;If an object is asymmetrical, increase its degree of asymmetry. </P><UL><LI>Differ shapes to prevent improper insertion of parts.</LI></UL><H3>Principle 5: Merging </H3><P>A.&nbsp;Bring closer together (or merge) identical or similar objects, assemble identical or similar parts to perform parallel operations. </P><UL><LI>Combine different functions in one piece of office equipment. <LI>Joystick changes both direction and speed. <LI>Electronic chips mounted on both sides of a circuit board or subassembly. <LI>Using touch screens for audio and climate controls at the same time.</LI></UL><P>B.&nbsp;Make operations contiguous or parallel; bring them together in time. </P><UL><LI>Bring together through multi-tasking. <LI>Group associated controls and functions.</LI></UL><H3>Principle 6: Universality </H3><P>A.&nbsp;Make a part or object perform multiple functions; eliminate the need for other parts. </P><UL><LI>Universal design for a broad range of people. <LI>Common personal computer operating systems. <LI>Common procedure standards. <LI>Multiple back-up methods. <LI>Icon and label conventions. <LI>Conventions for links on websites.</LI></UL><H3>Principle 7: Nested Doll</H3><P>A.&nbsp;Place one object inside another; in turn, place each object inside the other. </P><UL><LI>Nesting with menu hierarchies. <LI>Nesting within graphic displays.</LI></UL><P>B.&nbsp;Make one part pass through a cavity in the other. </P><UL><LI>Radio graphical user interface (GUI).
