<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ</b></i> is the Russian acronym for <i><b>The Theory of Inventive
Problem Solving</b></i>. TRIZ is a unique knowledge-based technology for accelerated
development of design concepts. The power of TRIZ is based on the understanding of the
evolution of successful products, generalization of the ways used to solve problems in the
most innovative inventions, and ways to overcome psychological barriers. Classical TRIZ is
described in books and papers by Genrich Altshuller, the creator of TRIZ, and his
followers.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This paper describes application of Advanced TRIZ to a reliability
problem concerning a Space Shuttle Class Main Engine (SSCME). Advanced TRIZ, a further
development of TRIZ by Zinovy Royzen, guides you in analyzing your system in order to
identify the best opportunities for its development and the best use of its resources.
Application of Advanced TRIZ to the problem has helped to develop concepts allowing
improvement of the reliability of an SSCME without any changes to the hardware.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. INTRODUCTION</b></p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has become increasingly important to develop successful new
generations of products while shortening development cycles and reducing project spending.
In the most difficult cases, a desired improvement in one area causes a deterioration in
another area. Very often, a trade-off solution is accepted, while a breakthrough solution
is needed. For example, if an attempt to increase the reliability of a product increases
its weight and cost, a trade-off solution suggests neither best reliability nor minimum
weight and cost.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In problem-solving, Advanced TRIZ systematically analyzes the problem
as an innovative situation and applies a series of step-by-step guidelines to generate
solution alternatives, improving the desired product parameters while minimizing product
changes and costs.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This paper briefly describes application of two techniques of Advanced
TRIZ. They are <i><b>TOP Analysis</b></i> and <i><b>Direct Ways to Eliminate a Harmful
Action. </b></i>TOP Analysis is the advanced development of Altshuller&#146;s
Substance-Field Analysis. The<i><b> </b></i>Direct Ways<i><b> </b></i>are a class of
Standard Techniques, the advanced development of Altshuller&#146;s set of 76 Standard
Solutions. In Direct Ways, Altshuller&#146;s five Standard Solutions to eliminate a
harmful action were reformulated, detailed, and combined into four, then two new
techniques were added. The Direct Ways offer six step-by-step techniques to eliminate a
harmful action.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Applying the Advanced TRIZ methodology from the beginning of your
project can save you much time and effort in your search for breakthrough concepts. As an
example, consider the following case study.</p>
<font SIZE="4"><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF TRIZ USED IN THE CASE STUDY</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Genrich S. Altshuller, the creator of the Theory of Inventive Problem
Solving, elaborated a method and a set of symbols for describing generic types of problems
and their solutions. The method was called the Substance-Field Analysis (SFA).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Altshuller&#146;s model of the simplest useful system is composed of
three elements &#151; the tool, the object, and the field. There are two ways of
describing a useful system.</p>

Figure 2. Model of the simplest useful system having a harmful action</p>
</b></i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The progression from words to symbols was to inventive problem solving
something like the progression from words and numbers to letters symbolizing constants and
unknowns in algebra, from words to symbols in logic, or from words to symbols in
chemistry.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next step in the development of TRIZ required improvement in
modeling. The models describe a useful system but not the useful function. The useful
function has one more element &#151; the product of the function.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TOP Analysis was developed by Zinovy Royzen in 1989. TOP stands for
Tool, Object, Product.</p>
<b><i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="4.gif" alt="4.gif (5597 bytes)" WIDTH="633" HEIGHT="191"><br>
Figure 4. Model of a harmful function</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TOP Analysis is an integral component of Advanced TRIZ methods for
analyzing a situation in product development that needs breakthrough concepts. Modeling
functions helps one to understand the product performance and formulate problems to solve.
Modeling a function by describing all four components &#151; the tool, the object, the
action, and the product &#151; improves understanding of the function, the available
resources, and the best ways for improvement.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ classifies problems in innovation into five generic types.
Presence of a harmful or undesired function is one of the most difficult types. Very often
an attempt to eliminate an unwanted function deteriorates a useful function of the product
or increases its cost. As a result, a trade-off solution is accepted, while a breakthrough
solution is needed. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. A RELIABILITY PROBLEM CONCERNING AN OXIDIZER TURBOPUMP</p>
</b></font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An oxidizer turbopump is one of the most complex and expensive
components of an SSCME. It feeds the main combustion chamber with oxygen. The turbine of
the oxidizer turbopump is rotated by a high velocity flow of very high temperature oxygen,
called GOX (gas oxygen). The turbopump is made of material that resists working
temperature oxygen.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Failure of the oxidizer turbopump can be caused by a dust particle or
other wearing particle in the GOX. Colliding with the hardware, a particle, having a very
high velocity because of the flow of GOX, would increase the temperature of the hardware
in the proximity of the collision to a level beyond which its material could not resist
the oxygen. Ignition of the hardware generates more heat and could result in complete
failure of the oxidizer turbopump and, as a result, the complete failure of the whole
engine.</p>
<font SIZE="4"><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. SUMMARY OF ANALYSIS OF THE FAILURE</b></font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problem 1.</b> A particle collides with hardware (for example, with the
turbine blade).</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image112.gif" border="1" WIDTH="382" HEIGHT="62"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problem 2.</b> The heated material of the blade does not resist the
oxygen.</p>

<i>Figure 5. Analysis of the zone of the harmful action</i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Analysis of the SSCME</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The engine includes a tank with liquid hydrogen, a tank with liquid
oxygen (LOX), the main combustion chamber, and the nozzle.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fuel (liquid hydrogen) passes through a high-pressure fuel
turbopump before cooling the main combustion chamber and nozzle. The fuel is vaporized
during the cooling process. After cooling, the fuel is split between two preburners.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The preburner of the fuel turbopump is fed by a fuel-rich mixture. The
preburner produces a high velocity flow of high temperature hydrogen that rotates the
turbine of the fuel turbopump.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The preburner of the oxygen turbopump is fed by an oxygen-rich mixture,
composed approximately 98-99% of oxygen. The oxygen turbopump preburner produces a high
velocity flow of high temperature oxygen that rotates the turbine of the oxidizer
turbopump.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. SUMMARY OF APPLICATION OF THE DIRECT WAYS</font></b></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problem 1</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Application of the Direct Ways to Problem 1 led to formulation of the
following approaches to solving the problem.</p>

</p><ol>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Try to insulate the blade from the particle.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Try to introduce a field that will prevent the collision (for
    example, by repelling the particle).</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Try to protect the blade by capturing the particle before it reaches
    the blade.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Try to modify the particle to make it harmless in the case of
    collision (for example, melt or evaporate the particle).</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Try to modify the blade to be nonsensitive to the collision (in other
    words, so the collision would not increase the temperature of the blade). This approach
    leads to formulation of the following physical contradiction: the temperature of the blade
    has to be increased by colliding particles, but the temperature of the blade must not be
    increased to the point of resisting GOX.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problem 2</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Application of the Direct Ways to Problem 2 led to formulation of the
following approaches to solving the problem.</p>

</p><ol>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Try to insulate the heated blade from the GOX. A technology to plate
    the hardware of the oxidizer turbopump with ceramic is known. This technology was
    developed in Russia. It is a very expensive technology. In addition, the ceramic plating
    would increase the weight of the engine. Furthermore, if the ceramic is not strong enough,
    it could cause engine failure.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Try to modify the GOX. If GOX is replaced by hydrogen, for example,
    the possibility of burning the hardware will be eliminated completely. This technology is
    known as a Full-Flow Staged Combustion Cycle Engine System. It has another potential for
    failure if high-temperature hydrogen mixes with the pumped oxygen in the oxidizer
    turbopump. (Elimination of potential mixture of high-temperature hydrogen with pumped
    oxygen in the oxidizer turbopump is an interesting problem to consider, but it was beyond
    the initial objectives of the project.)</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Try to reduce the temperature of GOX. The technology reducing the
    temperature of GOX without any reduction of the power of the oxidizer turbopump is known
    as a Full-Flow Staged Combustion Cycle Engine System. The power of the turbopump depends
    on the velocity and mass of the driving flow. In the known technology, all oxygen that is
    not directed to the fuel turbopump preburner passes through the oxidizer turbopump.
    Increase of the mass of the driving flow reduces the required velocity, resulting in
    reduction in the temperature of GOX.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Try to modify the heated blade. Try to increase the resistance of the
    blade material to oxygen. This is a materials problem. Materials having high resistance to
    oxygen do not necessarily have strong mechanical strength. Increasing the resistance of
    the material to oxygen very often causes increase of the weight of the turbopump.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Try to cool the blade to the working temperature, at which it resists
    oxygen. This raises subsequent problems: 1) how to cool the heated blade, and 2) how to
    keep the temperature of the cooled zone of the blade from falling below the working
    temperature (otherwise, the performance of the pump would be deteriorated). An obvious
    resource for cooling the blade is LOX. But using it as a coolant presents some
    constraints: it is difficult to maintain working temperature by cooling using LOX, and it
    is difficult to have LOX in the time and place of an accidental collision.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ requires consideration of all resources, including GOX and the
blade itself. From analysis of the simplified schematic of the engine, it is known that
GOX is not pure oxygen. GOX includes 1-2% of water vapor as a result of burning hydrogen.
Water vapor is an excellent coolant. It is already at the working temperature and ready to
cool the blade down to the working temperature. It was necessary to make calculations to
determine how much water vapor is required, but the concept does not require any changes
in the hardware of the engine.</p>
<font SIZE="4"><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CONCLUSION</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ is a logical, knowledge-based technology for conceptual design.
Application of TRIZ guides users in analyzing their systems and formulating the best
directions for improvements. Application of TRIZ helps users meet objectives of new
product development projects with less cost and without any unwanted effects, by
maximizing utilization of the resources of the system. TOP Analysis improves the
effectiveness of system analysis and problem formulation. Direct Ways to Eliminate a
Harmful Action help in formulating a set of mutually exclusive but collectively exhaustive
best possible improvements. This set is the basis for both short-term and long-term
planning of innovation.</p>
