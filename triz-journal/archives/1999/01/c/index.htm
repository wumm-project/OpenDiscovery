<p>1. Introduction</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Effective and efficient development of new generations of
products and processes is the mighty weapon in the competitive struggle.
Presently, there is no structured methodology to perform this extremely
important activity and the prevailing approach is the &quot;trial and
error,&quot; somewhat enhanced by several &quot;soft&quot; technology
forecasting techniques.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ in its Russian
abbreviation) provides a powerful structured methodology for a directed
development of new products/processes (Guided Technology Evolution). This paper
describes a background and some fundamental notions of this methodology and
illustrates them by some examples of product design evolution.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">2. Why we need to forecast technology</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Technology advancement is a principal impetus in economic
development. Foreseeing technological advancements that will shape the future is
of immense importance for many industrial, financial, or social enterprises,
since they can be deeply influenced by emerging innovations.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Companies capable of undertaking technology forecasting can
benefit in numerous ways, such as:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Take advantage over their competitors and dominate the market</li>
  <li>Be able to perform optimal planning and allocation of resources
    (investment, personnel, budget, inventory, etc.)</li>
  <li>Increase effectiveness in monitoring of the market monitoring</li>
  <li>Maximize financial gains and minimize the losses</li>
  <li>Improve quality of decision making</li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As global competition becomes more fierce, an ability to make
precise and comprehensive forecasts of the impending evolution becomes of
growing importance for economic well-being of many businesses.</p>
<b>
<p>3. Traditional technology forecasting techniques</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></b>Various technology forecasting methods [3, 8-10] have
been developed over the last few decades. Several of them, such as linear
extrapolation, morphological method, Delphi method, interlocking matrix,
relevance tree, dynamic simulation model, have found some applications. While
being different and generally useful, these techniques share the common
philosophy and constraints:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Traditional technological forecasts deal with parameters (e.g., speed,
    power, etc.) rather than with structures that are capable of realization of
    these parameters. They say nothing as <i>how to achieve</i> these
    parameters.</li>
  <li>It has been almost unanimously agreed by the experts that inventions
    shaping the future <i>absolutely cannot be forecast</i>.</li>
  <li>There are no <i>objective criteria</i> for evaluation of the forecasts.</li>
  <li>The reference ground for traditional forecasts are technological
    capabilities of the systems being foreseen. Yet many consumer products
    intended to please various people’s tastes cannot be described only in
    conventional engineering dimensions and, therefore, do not submit to such a
    forecasting analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">To overcome above constraints, caused mainly by intuitive
approach to innovation prediction, and make technology forecasting a practical
tool for a long- term business development, a new approach, based upon a
systematic logical analysis, has to be introduced.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">4. Laws and Lines of Technological Systems Evolution</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">An analytical approach to technology forecasting has been
developed by Genrikh Altshuller and his school within a framework of TRIZ [1, 2,
4-7, 11]. The theoretical foundation of the TRIZ technology forecasting is a set
of the <i>Laws </i>or<i> Prevailing Trends of Technological Systems Evolution </i>revealed
by analysis of hundreds of thousands of invention descriptions available in the
world patent databases<i>. </i>These laws, along with other analytical and
solution tools of TRIZ, can be used for a judicious<i> </i>analysis and
evaluation of the future designs of the systems of interest.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Laws of Evolution reflect significant, stable, and
repeatable interactions between elements of technological systems and between
the systems and their environment in the process of evolution. These Laws are
listed below.</p>
</p><ul>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Increasing Degree of Ideality</li>
    <li>Non-Uniform Evolution of Sub-Systems</li>
    <li>Transition to a Higher-Level System</li>
    <li>Increasing Flexibility</li>
    <li>Shortening of Energy Flow Path</li>
    <li>Transition from Macro- to Micro-Level</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Laws of Technological System evolution serve as
&quot;soft equations&quot; describing the system’s &quot;life curve&quot; in
the evolution space. If configuration of the current system is given, then
configurations on the next stages of development can be reliably
&quot;calculated&quot; using the system of these Laws.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Laws of Evolution are very helpful for technology
forecasting since they identify the most effective directions for the system’s
development. For example, the Law of Increasing Flexibility<i> </i>states that
technological systems evolve from rigid structures into flexible or adaptive
ones. An illustration to this Law is evolution of aircraft structures that went
from rigid wing designs to variable-geometry wing designs. A Law of Evolution
delineates a <i>general direction for further system transformation but says
nothing about the details of this transformation</i>.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The latter is addressed by a continuous study and development
of the <i>Lines of Technological Systems Evolution. </i>These Lines describe
more specifically the stages of the systems development.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This system of Laws and Lines of Evolution is illustrated
below on the example of two Laws and the respective Lines of technology
evolution.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>4.1. Law of Transition to a Higher-Level System</b></p>
<p>This Law states that <i>technological systems evolve in a general direction
from mono-systems to bi- or poly-systems.</i></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Systems usually originate as single objects - <i>mono-systems.
</i>An example of a mono-system is a pencil. Mono-systems can be combined to
form higher-level systems: <i>bi-systems </i>(i.e., pencil+eraser), or <i>poly-systems
</i>(i.e., a set of more than two different pencils).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A higher-level system can be composed from similar or
identical subsystems. Combining several mono-systems into such a <i>homogeneous
bi- </i>or<i> poly-system </i>can enhance functional performance of each
constitutive sub-system and develop a new and useful functional properties.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Transition to bi- and poly-systems (Fig. 1) represents a very
important and very powerful trend of evolution. The following are examples of
bi-systems which resulted in enhancement of functional properties of the
original mono-systems:</p>
</p><ul>
  </p><ul>
    <li>scissors (a bi-system of two knife &quot;mono-systems&quot;)</li>
    <li>spectacles (a bi-system of two monocles)</li>
    <li>binoculars (a bi-system of two telescopes, which are themselves
      bi-systems of two lenses each)</li>
    <li>catamaran (a bi-system of two ship hulls providing enhanced stability)</li>
    <li>two-barrel hunting rifle (a bi-system of two rifles)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">These examples are based on combining identical components.
In other cases, the component sub-systems can be similar but different in size,
color, and/or functional properties. Examples of such systems are:</p>
</p><ul>
  </p><ul>
    <li>a set of wrenches for hexagonal nuts of different sizes</li>
    <li>a set of wrenches for hexagonal nuts and Allen bolts/heads</li>
    <li>a universal screwdriver with tips of different shapes (straight,
      Phillips, etc.) stored inside the handle</li>
    <li>an &quot;open&quot;/&quot;closed&quot; sign (&quot;open&quot; in black
      letters on one side of the sign board, &quot;closed&quot; in red letters
      on the other side of the board).</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Such bi- and poly-systems are called <i>shifted bi- </i>and
    <i>poly-systems</i>.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Effectiveness of bi-systems and poly-systems may increase
when their components are more diverse. Some examples of <i>heterogeneous
bi-systems </i>comprised of diverse components are a wristwatch with a
calculator; key ring with a pen knife; and a pencil with eraser. The latter case
represents an important type of <i>inverse</i> <i>bi-systems</i> - a combination
of components with opposite properties. An interesting application of combining
components with opposite properties into a bi-system is suggested in a project
of a &quot;bi-greenhouse.&quot; In one section of this greenhouse, plants are
growing that extract carbon dioxide from the surrounding air, while emitting
oxygen. In the other section, other types of plants are growing, such varieties
that extract oxygen from air and emit carbon dioxide. Such a greenhouse does not
require an air-exchange system.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Effectiveness of bi- and poly-systems can be enhanced in the
process of their <i>convolution</i>. The first steps of this process involve
elimination of redundant auxiliary components. This leads to forming a <i>partially
convoluted bi- </i>or<i> poly-system. </i>For example, a double-barreled gun has
only one butt; and a multi-boiler power station may have less smoke stacks than
boilers.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The next step of evolution is a transition to a <i>completely
convoluted bi- </i>or<i> poly-system </i>when one system performs two or more
functions.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Example 1</p>
    </i>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Protective suits for emergency rescue workers in mines
    have a cooling system and an oxygen-supply system. It was proposed by
    Genrikh Altshuller to combine these two systems by using liquid oxygen.
    First, the oxygen is used in the cooling system, and then,</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">after its temperature increases during the cooling
    process, it is used for breathing. This combination has resulted in
    significant weight reduction and allowed for increasing the resource of the
    system between recharging the life support gear.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">4.2 Law of Increasing Flexibility<i></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></i></b>According to this Law, <i>in the course of evolution,
technological systems develop from rigid structures to flexible and adaptive
ones.</i><b></p>
<p align="CENTER">Line of Increasing Flexibility</b></p>
<p align="CENTER"><img border="0" src="02.gif" width="559" height="79"><br>
Fig. 2</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A new technological system developed to solve a specific
problem, performs in a specified environment, at specified regimes, etc. Its
design reflects, accordingly, the specific needs that this system has to
satisfy. It is characterized by rigidly defined connections between its
components that usually prevent the system from adapting to the changing
environment. Such a system demonstrates feasibility of the main design concept.
It performs satisfactorily the main task for which it was developed, but its
application environment, as well as performance parameters are limited. Studies
of evolution of numerous systems have demonstrated that a typical process of
evolution involves phases during which the structure of the system is becoming
less rigid and more adaptable to the changing environment. This trend is
universal; it can be easily recognized in many commonly used systems.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For many systems increasing flexibility usually begins with
replacement of stationary components with moving ones, replacement of a rigid
linkage or a rigid structure by a segmented linkage/structure connected by
hinges, replacement of rigid components with flexible ones such as hydraulic and
pneumatic systems, introduction of nonlinear components, etc. The more advanced
stages in the increasing flexibility process are characterized by using physical
and chemical effects and phenomena, by implementing servo-controlled systems,
etc.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">4.4.4 Discussion</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The described above steps of evolution of the hair comb/brush
are not always aligned in a chronological order. This is typical for,
practically, any technological system. Some pioneering patent can be granted a
hundred years ahead of its time, and most of the patents/inventions/solutions
appear rather chaotically. However, major developments fit into basic steps of
the Lines of Evolution. Accordingly, these steps can be applied to an existing
product/process in order to develop a continuum of potential evolutionary
changes in its design/structure. This process represents the TRIZ technological
forecasting, or Guided Technology Evolution.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">4.4.5. Evolution of varifocal lens systems</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></b>The type of Conventional varifocal (zoom) lens systems
that is most commonly found in practice is the multi-element glass lens system
that is optically structured so that its focus can be varied by changing the
axial air spacing between its elements through the use of movable mechanical
lens mounts.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Another type of variable focus lens systems utilizes a pair
of optical refracting plates having surfaces that are specifically configured to
selectively define, in combination, spherical lenses having different focal
lengths as the plates are displaced with respect to one another.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">All conventional varifocal lens systems share common
fundamental drawbacks:</p>
</p><ul>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Considerable weight of and space occupied by numerous glass elements.</li>
    <li>Expensive and time-consuming manufacturing (i.e., grinding and
      polishing).</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">4.4.6. TRIZ analysis of the conventional varifocal lens
systems</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">From TRIZ standpoint (Line of Increasing Flexibility), it is
clear that the aforementioned drawbacks can be eliminated by transition from
rigid lens systems based on glass elements (lenses and mirrors) to systems that
may use elements made of other, more flexible materials.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Line of Increasing Flexibility suggests that the lens
systems should evolve through the following stages (Fig. 4):</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>One rigid glass lens</li>
  <li>Two-lens varifocal system</li>
  <li>Multi-lens varifocal system</li>
  <li>Elastomeric varifocal lens system</li>
  <li>Liquid varifocal lens system</li>
  <li>Gas varifocal lens system</li>
  <li>Varifocal lens system using various fields (first of all, fields of
    electromagnetic nature)</li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Analysis of both patent databases and R&amp;D literature,
performed by The TRIZ Group, corroborates to a large extent this assumption.
Stages 1-3 are represented by the conventional lens systems. Varifocal lens
systems corresponding to stages 4-6 can be found in many recent patents and
publications. Varifocal lens systems of stage 7 are not developed yet.<font size="2"></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">4.4.7. Overview of non-conventional varifocal lens systems</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Typical elastic lens system</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The variable focus lens system of this type comprises a lens
element formed of at least one transparent, homogeneous elastomeric material
that is shaped to provide it with a predetermined focus length when the lens
element is in relaxed or nearly relaxed state.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There are means for supporting the lens element along and
perpendicular to its optical axis and for applying radial tensile stress around
the periphery of the lens element (as shown, for example, in U.S. Patent
4,444,471, Figs 2, 3)</p>

</b>Fig. 6</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The preferred embodiment of the variable focus lens system is
shown in Fig. 5. The lens system comprises four major elements, an integrally
formed, elastomeric optical member 12, a two-part clamp 20, a circular bezel 38,
and a cylindrical tubular member 40. The optical member 12 is a three-part
structure comprising a central lens element 14, a circular flexible membrane 16,
and a circular toroidal edge 18. On the outer surface of the tubular member 40
there are two grooves 72 (Fig. 6) that are spaced 18--degrees apart into which
slidabli fit a corresponding pair of tongues 30 extending forwardly parallel to
the optical axis, OA, from the clam front section 22. Clockwise rotation of
bezel 38 about axis OA causes the tubular member 40 to displace axially along
axis OA, so that the forward edge of the tubular member 40, comprising the
rollers 66, contacts the flexible membrane 16 at a predetermined radial distance
away from the peripheral edge of the lens element 14. As the tubular member 40
is displaced along axis OA, it leading edge operates to apply a force to the
flexible membrane 16 in the direction parallel to axis OA.. The radial stress
thus created is uniformly distributed about the periphery of the lens element 14
and operates to alter its shape (Fig. 3), so that the focal length of the lens
element 14 can be changed in a continuous manner.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Typical liquid lens system</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></b>In a typical fluid lens system (as suggested, for
example, in U.S. Patent 4,466,706, Fig. 7), a variable shape/volume chamber is
filled with an optically clear fluid, having a specified refraction coefficient,
the pressure of which is regulated by adjusting the volume of the chamber. The
latter is closed at opposite ends by resilient optically clear diaphragm
elements that bend or budge with varying degrees of curvature responsive to
pressure changes induced in the fluid.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Typically, a pair of axially adjustable telescoping sleeves
defines a chamber. The opposite outer ends of the chamber are closed by a pair
of relatively thin resilient optical discs formed of available plastic material.
The discs alter their curvatures in response to changes in the fluid pressure.</p>

<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Typical gas lens system</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In these systems, gas pressure changes correlate with
movements of the lens through magnification changes. Changing the pressure of
the high refraction index gas leads to changing the focal length of the gas
lens, and, as a result, to changing the focal length of the whole lens assembly.
Fig. 8 (as represented in U.S. Patent 4,732,458) is a schematic representation
of a gas zoom lens 10. Lens 10 comprises a first lens group 22 (A, B) and a
second lens group 24 (C, D). Separating the negative meniscus elements B, C is a
cavity 26 filled with a heavy high refraction index gas. Connected to the cavity
26 is a piston/cylinder assembly 30. Piston 32 is adapted to move up and down
within cylinder 34 raising or lowering, respectively, the pressure of the gas in
the cavity 26.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">4.4.8 Major design problems of the non-conventional (fluid)
varifocal lenses</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There is a growing need for large telescopes, projection
lenses, aerial camera lenses, satellite camera lenses, and concentrating lenses
for solar energy devices that can be met by lenses formed by liquids and gases.
Despite many potential uses of the latter (mostly, because of their low cost),
they have two major design restrictions:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Waves and ripples resulting from vibrations introduced by the surrounding<br>
    environment and/or mechanisms.</li>
  <li>The varifocal lens must have a quick response to make it suitable for
    various applications. Quick response varifocal lenses can be designed by
    using a highly rigid material. However, because of the pressure applied to
    the operating liquid or gas, the use of transparent elastic films made of a
    rigid material results in the generation of harmful aberrations.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">These problems are not overcome in the existing proposed
  designs.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">4.4.9. TRIZ approach to resolving the design problems of
  the non-conventional<br>
  (fluid) varifocal lenses</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">From TRIZ standpoint, further promotion of the fluid
varifocal lenses is possible by advancing their structure farther along the Line
of Increasing Flexibility (Fig. 1). This suggests the following design changes:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>To use magnetic and electric fields as means to control structural
    properties of fluid lenses.</li>
  <li>To replace conventional optically clear fluids with optically clear fluids
    susceptible to magnetic and/or electric fields.</li>
  <li>To use materials exhibiting non-linear mechanical/optical properties.</li>
</ol>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">5. Comparison between traditional and TRIZ technology
forecasts</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The traditional and TRIZ forecasts can be distinguished by
their respective outcomes. A conventional technology forecast is concerned with
calculating the probability that a particular parameter of the system of
interest reaches certain level by the specified point in time. A TRIZ forecast
results in developing of an array of design modifications of the system that may
advance it along its S-curve.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus, the main benefits of the TRIZ forecasting are the
following:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>TRIZ forecast means developing conceptual designs of new systems. In other
    words, TRIZ forecast shows not only what will happen, but also how to
    achieve the desirable results.</li>
  <li>Higher accuracy of the forecast, since it is based on the Laws of
    Technological Systems Evolution.</li>
  <li>Detection of the point in time when development of the present technology
    should be abandoned and new directions should be explored.</li>
</ul>

  </ol>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">6.1 Analysis of the system's evolution</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Evolution of technological systems can be illustrated by an
S-shaped (Fig. 9) curve reflecting changes of the system's benefit-to-cost ratio
with time since the inception of the system. In phase 1 the system's development
is relatively slow. Phase 2 features a fast development, usually associated with
a commercial implementation of the system and perfecting of the manufacturing
processes. Then the pace of development eventually slows down (phase 3) and
stalls (phase 4). Sometimes the system enters phase 5 of degradation. In some
cases, the system undergoes &quot;renaissance&quot; (phase 6), which can be
sparked by availability of new materials, of new manufacturing technology,
and/or by development of new applications. When system A in Fig. 9 is
approaching the conclusive phases 3 and 4 of its development, usually a new
system B having a higher performance potential is already waiting in the wings.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The length and slope of each segment on the system's life
curve depends not only on technological but also on economic and on human
factors. The common sense (in the hindsight!) suggests that a new system B in
Fig. 9 should start its fast development when development of the system A begins
slowing down. However, frequently development of system B is delayed by special
interest groups which have large investments into the existing technology, job
security, etc., associated with the old system.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Analysis performed by Altshuller demonstrated that inventive
activity correlates closely with the S-curve. A typical function &quot;number of
inventions per unit time ?? time&quot; for a system (Fig. 10) has two peaks. The
first peak occurs near point a on the S-curve thus indicating the beginning of
mass implementation of the new system. The second peak coincides with the end of
the system's &quot;natural life&quot; (around point g ) and is associated with
efforts (usually futile in the long run) to extend the system’s life, to
compete with the new evolving system.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Fig. 11 shows the level of inventions at different stages of
the system’s life. At the beginning, inventions creating the basis for a new
system are usually of a high level (i.e., high degree of novelty). This level
gradually declines and then rises again in the process of implementation of the
system, when many problems associated with manufacturing and marketing must be
solved. After this peak, the levels of inventions drop again.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="1" src="9-12.gif" width="544" height="507"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Fig. 12 illustrates dynamics of change of average economic
effectiveness of a technological system in different periods. The first
inventions that lay foundation for the system , notwithstanding their high
technical level, do not bring profit since the system exists only on paper as a
promising concept. The rewards for the inventions grow in the course of
implementation of the system. At the stages when the system is in mass
production, even small improvements may result in significant economic rewards.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is usually feasible to collect information needed to plot
the above curves. Analysis of these curves helps one to determine position of
the system of interest on its S-curve.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Three typical cases may exist:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The system has not progressed up to point <img src="a_.jpg" alt="a" border="0" width="17" height="33">
    <i>,</i> Fig. 9. Position of this point should be determined by forecasting
    the potential of the system<i> </i>as compared with the competing systems.
    The condition associated with point <img src="a_.jpg" alt="a" border="0" width="17" height="33">
    develops only when deterioration of the preceding system begins. The
    existing system deters development of the new competing system.</li>
  <li>If the system evolves between points <img src="a_.jpg" alt="a" border="0" width="17" height="33">
    and <img src="b_.jpg" alt="b" border="0" width="23" height="32">, the forecast should determine
    physical limits of the system based on the objective factors (e.g., strength
    of materials, heat producing capacity of fuels, various barriers such as
    speed of sound for airplanes, manufacturing costs, etc.). An array of
    conceptual modifications of the system that may provide for its advancement
    up to point&nbsp; and <img src="b_.jpg" alt="b" border="0" width="23" height="32"> should be
    conceived.</li>
  <li>The system has passed point&nbsp; and <img src="b_.jpg" alt="b" border="0" width="23" height="32">
    (or point <img src="g_.jpg" alt="g" border="0" width="19" height="32">). In this case, the
    forecasting process is, in<br>
    essence, a search for a new system that may succeed the existing system.</li>
</ol>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">6.2 &quot;Road mapping&quot;</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After the history of the system's evolution and its position
on S-curve have been established, the Laws and Lines of Evolution are applied to
foresee (conceptually) the possible future designs of the system. Analysis of
the state-of-the-art of the present system allows one to determine the current
stage of the system’s evolution and identify the next stages. At this phase,
application of various Lines of Evolution enables identification of the missing
steps and feasible future steps of development.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">6.3 Problem formulation</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As a rule, transition from one stage of evolution to the next
stage is accompanied by formulation of design and/or production problems to be
resolved. For example, the need to increase flexibility of a system by
introducing electromagnetic field can contradict the requirement for the design
simplicity. Thus, to make the next step in the system’s evolution, a conflict
between increasing flexibility and design complexity has to be overcome.</p>
<p>Since the forecasting is carried out along several Lines of Evolution that
represent different Laws, usually there are many engineering problems, which are
to be formulated and resolved.</p>
