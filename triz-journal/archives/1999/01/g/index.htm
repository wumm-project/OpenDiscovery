1998 issue</a>. The following is a solution provided by Mr. Skir:</p>

<p>To solve the problem of Universal Socket Wrench you have, first, to use the Principle
of Dynamics: to make the wrench match himself to every nut size. The implementation of the
Dynamics Principle is performed by the Segmentation Principle. Still it is not clear how
to implement it: the Dynamics Principle pushes you to the direction of flexibility, but
you may not let the nut any freedom, you may not let the wrench clamp the nut in a
flexible way &#150; only firm. The contradiction &quot;flexible &#150; not flexible&quot;
is resolved in structure: the radial direction is firm, while the axial direction is
elastic. The socket is built of multiple rods, the rods are spring driven. They adjust
automatically, reset when you are done. Even broken nuts give way to this socket. (Popular
Science -- January 1998 -- P. 91.)</p>

<p>The TRIZ Journal ran a second problem by Yakov Skir in the <a href="../../../1998/11/index.htm">November 1998 issue</a>. The following is a solution
provided by Mr. Skir:</p>

<p>The question of the Wing Walking was to find the Resource helping Teresa Stokes to
perform gymnastic routines on the plane wing during plane flight. Not magnetic boots, not
centrifugal force, and nothing that you have on earth. The right answer is that the force
lifting her body up against the steel platform for her headstand is the wind. Teresa uses
the wind to her advantage. (Popular Mechanics &#150; June 1996.)</p>
