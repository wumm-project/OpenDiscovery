<p>Over the last few years I have done my doctoral research at Stanford in
creativity. This is a short review of the research. The research adds new
insight on the subject of creativity together with providing a framework for a
systematic practice of creativity. The research builds on the current methods of
creativity. There have been steady advances in the practice of creativity (such
as TRIZ), but little towards a fundamental understanding. A critical shortfall
in the field of creativity is the lack of models.</p>
<p>The thesis of my research is that metaphor can serve as a model for
creativity, that is metaphors can provide a basis of representation,
explanation, and prediction. The selection of the specific models is supported
by surveying of the writings of creative thinkers, people who write about
creativity, people who attempt to simulate creative thinkers, and work in
cognitive science and linguistics. The common pattern among all of these
writings is that there are three primary metaphors used to describe creativity.
These metaphors serve as models of thinking including creativity as one form of
thinking. The metaphors are:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Thinking is perceiving. This metaphor gives rise to a representation model
    that deals with issues of what and how information is considered, illusion,
    and the representation of information in insightful ways. Linguistic
    evidence includes expressions such as 'I see what you mean' or 'what you
    said is fuzzy at first, but now I am clearer'.</li>
  <li>Thinking is moving. This metaphor gives rise to a search model that deals
    with issues of sequencing of actions, end state, obstacles and alternatives.
    Linguistic evidence includes expressions such as 'if we can get around this
    obstacle we will reach our solution' or 'I am following what you are saying
    until you lost me at that point'.</li>
  <li>Thinking is object manipulation. This metaphor gives rise to a
    restructuring model that deals with issues of the combination and
    interaction of ideas. Linguistic evidence includes expressions such as
    'these two ideas are incompatible' or 'if we can just find this last piece
    we will have a complete product'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the metaphors pertain to different facets of creativity. By putting
the metaphoric correspondences into a formal system the three metaphors together
form a powerful collection of models for creativity.</p>
<p>The metaphors fulfill the three functions of models. First, the metaphors
provide a basis of representation. This is demonstrated using three surveys in
each case showing a correspondence with the metaphors of thinking. As mentioned,
for a collection of descriptions of creativity the quotes correspond to the
three metaphors. In another survey of creative problems the solutions to the
problems correspond to the three metaphors as well. Most importantly, in a
survey of creative methods, each method can be described in terms of one of the
three metaphors.</p>
<p>The three metaphors also fulfill the explanation function of models. The
three metaphors exist within a larger web of metaphors. In the context of the
three metaphors is a metaphorical system describing causality, action, and state
and another system that describes conceptions of the mind. The three metaphors
of thinking are a natural product of these more fundamental metaphors. This
relation explains why we have the metaphors we do to describe creativity which
in turn explains why we conceive of creativity and approach creativity in the
way we do. Since there are three distinct metaphors it also explains why
creativity may mean different things to different people and why approaches to
creativity are seemingly so disparate.</p>
<p>The last function of models, prediction, is also fulfilled by the three
metaphors of thinking. In this case, the metaphors have suggested new techniques
for creativity. The interrelations between the metaphors also suggest how the
methods that correspond to the metaphors might be used in concert. There are
other interesting implications that come from the predictive quality of the
metaphors. One is to identify indicators of when a creative approach is
warranted. Some of these indicators tend to exist within analytic frameworks.
For example, highly complex decision problems can be represented in an analytic
framework. Decision analytic tools can be employed to indicate which components
of the decision could benefit from a creative focus.</p>
<p>The model-based approach to creativity promises to be an important step
forward. The key idea is that metaphoric models can bring structure to creative
processes. The main result is a comprehensive process that unifies and
coordinates the creative techniques. In addition, the metaphors set the new
process on a solid foundation. This new model-based approach provides a
structured way to direct creativity.</p>
<p>In an informal survey of problems the techniques that were strongly motivated
by metaphor solved a high percentage of the problems than those that were not.
Interestingly, a large percentage of current methods are not highly motivated by
any metaphor (e.g. brainstorming), and these are very unproductive as a
systematic process. Furthermore, the comprehensive and systematic nature of the
metaphors means resolving the haphazard approach that is so commonly associated
with many creative methodologies. Perhaps the most persuasive argument of the
value of the model-based approach is that it has produced solutions to problems
resistant to the best of the current creative practices.</p>
<p>Interestingly, for those individuals that have developed a creative method,
the person tended to work within one metaphor. (For instance Altshuller seems to
be oriented towards the object manipulation metaphor and DeBono towards the
moving metaphor). In essence, each metaphor serves as a different paradigm of
creativity. By making the paradigms explicit we can both better exploit the
cognitive structure that they contain and also work outside the paradigm when
appropriate.</p>
