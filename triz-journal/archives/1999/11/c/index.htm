<p>Introduction</p>
</b>
<p>It was always Altshuller’s view that TRIZ would one day expand to encompass
knowledge from the biological sciences (1, 2). In the first instance, it is
likely that a biological knowledge-base will be incorporated into the Effects
part of the Theory, thus allowing engineers and scientists to utilise biological
data in a form which relates a known biological effect to the desired functional
capability trying to be achieved. It is not difficult to see how this
incorporation process may be achieved.</p>
<p>Possibilities for the incorporation of biological knowledge into parts of
TRIZ other than ‘Effects’ - into the Standard Inventive Solutions, or Trends
of Evolution, or, particularly, Contradictions parts for example - are, on the
other hand, somewhat less clear.</p>
<p>The aim of this brief article is to examine a number of case study examples
looking at how nature has generated inventive solutions to contradiction-like
problems, at whether the same 40 Inventive Principles apply, and specifically at
whether nature uses the same Inventive Principles for a given technical
contradiction as those recommended by the Contradiction Matrix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Webbed Feet</p>
</b>
<p>The webbed feet of aquatic birds (Figure 1) offer a good example of how
evolution has produced an inventive solution to the conflict between the desire
for a high surface area and low weight.</p>

</font>
<p>In terms of the generic parameters of the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix, the
conflict occurs between SURFACE AREA OF MOVING OBJECT and WEIGHT OF MOVING
OBJECT. The Matrix indicates that the four most common methods used by man to
resolve this kind of conflict are:-</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>
      <p align="left">‘Separation’</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">‘Another Dimension’</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">‘Pneumatics and Hydraulics’, and,</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">‘Asymmetry’</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>None of these gives any real suggestion that ‘webbing’ offers a good
inventive solution. Thus inventors relying on the TRIZ suggestions are unlikely
to come up with solutions which use the excellent ‘Flexible Shells and Thin
Films’ (if thinking in terms of the 40 defined Inventive Principles) concept
suggested by the Figure 1 albatross and other birds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Man’s desire to move more quickly, and more efficiently around the planet
by either air or sea is tightly constrained by a number of technical
contradictions. In terms of the generic parameters defined by Altshuller in the
TRIZ Contradiction Matrix, a very common contradiction occurs between speed and
rate of energy consumption; in which increasing speed causes energy consumption
performance to worsen, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The Contradiction Matrix identifies the Inventive Principles:-</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Weight Compensation</li>
    <li>Dynamic Parts, and</li>
    <li>Parameter Changes</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>as the three most common and effective methods identified by the world’s
finest inventors in seeking to eliminate this SPEED versus USE OF ENERGY
contradiction. Thinking in terms of aircraft design, it is possible to see how
each of the three Principles has been employed to improve the state of the art
in recent years:-</p>
<p>‘Weight Compensation’ has been successfully used in Russian designs for
both the wing-in-ground effect ekranoplane and the ‘aerostatic aeroplane’
(Figure 2) - in which wing lift requirements are reduced through incorporation
of helium carrying cavities.</p>
<p>‘Dynamic Parts’ is an Inventive Principle commonly used in aircraft
design to solve speed/energy consumption contradictions in the form of ‘swing-wing’
designs like the F1-11 or Tornado - where drag (and hence energy consumption) at
high speed is reduced by swinging the wings backwards to reduce their frontal
area.</p>
<p>‘Parameter Changes’ (‘Change an object’s physical state’) has been
successfully used again, in swing-wing aircraft, and also in concepts using
boundary layer blowing (changing the state of the lifting surfaces), boundary
layer suction, and numerous other variable geometry wing configurations.</p>

</font>
<p>Looking at the means adopted by nature in solving this kind of speed versus
energy use contradiction, apart from the ‘Weight Compensation’ Principle
(which is used by fishes through their use of a swim bladder to tune their
buoyancy such that they require no energy in order to maintain or change depth),
it seems clear that there are again striking differences between natural
solution strategies and those adopted by man.</p>
<p>This is perhaps most vividly seen by considering how the shark resolves the
speed/energy contradiction. The shark is the fastest living sea-creature. It
achieves this in no small part due to the profile of the myriad tiny protruding
scales which cover it’s skin - Figure 3.</p>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<p align="center"><img src="Image43.gif" border="1" width="315" height="189">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="Image42.gif" border="1" width="156" height="113"></p>
<p align="center"></font><font size="2">Figure 3: Use of ‘Local Quality’
Inventive Principle in Shark Skin</p>
</font>
<p>The shark scales act as a very effective boundary layer control mechanism
giving the shark a very low drag coefficient. In TRIZ terms, the shark has
evolved this three-dimensional structure of permanently protruding dermal
denticles using the Inventive Principles ‘Local Quality’ and ‘Another
Dimension’.</p>
<p>As well as further illustrating how the natural world often uses different
Inventive Principles to those traditionally adopted by human inventors, the
shark example offers an example of a naturally evolved effect which is amenable
to direct adoption in human engineered products - e.g. boat hulls, aircraft
wings, etc.</p>

<p>Dandelion Seed Dispersal System</p>
</b>
<p>The parachute gives another speed related design contradiction. This time,
the contradiction exists between the desire to reduce the speed of descent of a
parachute versus the amount of parachute area required to achieve the speed
reduction. In other words, the parachute designer is only able to improve
(reduce) descent speed by worsening (using more) parachute material.</p>
<p>The TRIZ Contradiction Matrix indicates that inventors from across all
industries have successfully used Inventive Principles ‘Flexible Shells and
Thin Films’ (not so surprising in relation to the parachute problem!), ‘Pneumatics
and Hydraulics’, and ‘Discarding and Recovering’ as the three most
effective means of resolving the contradiction.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note with the dandelion (and indeed many other
wind-dispersed seeds found in the natural world) that the method of solving the
speed/area conflict is again markedly different to man’s solution strategies.</p>

</font><font size="2">
<p align="CENTER">Figure 4: Dandelion Seed as Parachute</p>
</font>
<p>In fact the dandelion uses Inventive Principles ‘Local Quality’, ‘Segmentation’,
and, ‘Self-Service’ (i.e. each fibre of the seed ‘parachute’ influences
the flow around adjacent fibres). Other solutions may be seen to adopt other
Principles - e.g. the sycamore uses ‘Asymmetry’. Very few appear to adopt
the three Principles most commonly used by man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Relation to Contradiction Matrix</p>
<p></b>Of course the Contradiction Matrix was never intended to be an absolute
method for identifying the ‘correct’ Inventive Principles for a given
technical contradiction, and many users will recognise that the Matrix is often
adrift in a manner which increases markedly with the complexity and type of
problem under consideration - see Figure 5.</p>
<p>The amount of data thus far gathered for macro-scale biological sciences is
unlikely to be sufficient to draw quantitative conclusions at this stage, but it
is however certainly sufficient to demonstrate that the chances of the current
Matrix mimicking Nature’s best inventive efforts is small.</p>

<p>Conclusions</p>
</b>
</p><ol>
  <li>There is considerable evidence to suggest that nature solves technical
    contradictions in inventive ways.</li>
  <li>It also appears clear that the same 40 Inventive Principles discovered by
    Altshuller through the analysis of the global patent database, also apply
    across the natural world.</li>
  <li>From the preliminary evidence provided by these cases studies, it would
    appear that nature often uses different Inventive Principles to the ones
    recommended by the Contradiction Matrix. In that the Matrix has been
    constructed from the best of man’s inventive capabilities, this fact
    suggests, that we still have much to learn from the natural world.</li>
  <li>The TRIZ framework provides a highly systemised means by which such
    natural world inventive problem solving skills can be made accessible to
    inventors and problem solvers across all fields of science and engineering.</li>
