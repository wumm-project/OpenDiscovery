<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solving difficult problems is a complex activity that is
governed by the search for knowledge. Problem solving is affected by a
combination of the searching process and by the availability of the knowledge
required to solve the problem. This paper describes the application of the
Ideation/TRIZ Methodology and specific analytical and knowledge-base tools as
used by DTM Corporation to solve a complex technological problem.</p>

  <p>Utilization of the Ideation Process</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">STEP 1. PROBLEM DOCUMENTATION AND PRELIMINARY PROBLEM
  ANALYSIS</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ideation Process begins with a six-part questionnaire
  called the Innovation Situation Questionnaire™ (ISQ™). The ISQ is a
  template for preliminary problem analysis, and consists of a set of questions
  that help define at the problem situation from a different point of view.
  These questions are not typical engineering- or management-oriented questions,
  but are <i>innovation oriented</i>, resulting from years of accumulated
  research in the successful application of TRIZ-based methods and tools in the
  solving of inventive problems. The questions in the ISQ provide the problem
  solver with a systematic way to approach the problem situation, and prompt
  him/her to consider things that are typically disregarded or go unnoticed
  during problem solving. Interestingly, 10% of the time the ISQ alone is enough
  to resolve the problem.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The questionnaire contains six main categories:</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">STEP 2. PROBLEM FORMULATION</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problem formulation begins with the development of a
  graphical model consisting of the events and conditions - in terms of
  cause-and-effect relationships - that comprise the problem situation. While
  this might appear to be similar to functional diagramming, it differs inasmuch
  as it provides for a new level of creativity in the search for (and
  im­plement­ation of) solutions. The functional language of Value Engineering
  allowed engineers to move beyond their professional language to a “common”
  language that had relevance to marketing and the needs of the customer.
  Problem formulation provides a similar language transformation: one that
  trans­forms a functional language to an <i>innovation language </i>(see
  Figure 1).</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="fig1.jpg" width="638" height="332"></font><font SIZE="2"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process of moving from a functional language to an
innovation language introduces additional levels of refinement and comprehension
of the problem situation. The underlying benefit is that, when a situation is
formulated (or, more accurately, <i>reformulated</i>), the solution often
becomes obvious or is more easily obtained than through the initial statement of
the problem situation. The process of problem formulation is the continued
through “slicing” of a complex or unclear situation into a comprehensive set
of well-defined problems. Directly attacking each “slice” is the key to the
successful generation of ideas and, consequently, to the development of
implementable solution concepts.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The notion that a problem situation can be explicated into
multiple problem statements is rooted in Altshuller’s “multi-screen” model
of creative thinking, a.k.a. the <i>systems approach</i>. This approach holds
that any system has a hierarchical structure that includes subordinate
sub-systems and at least one higher-level system (the so-called “super-system”)
to which it, in turn, serves as a sub-system. Very often, the links between
these systems, sub-systems and super-systems are rigid enough to ensure that a
change in one part of the system causes substantial changes (either positive or
negative) in other sub-systems and in adjacent systems as well. In particular:</p>
<blockquote>
</font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">·</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">A breakdown in
one part of the system can cause undesired consequences in other parts of the
system, and in the system as a whole.</p>
</font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">·</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">An undesired
situation in one part of the system can be eliminated by changing a different
part of the system</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result, one problem can be addressed in different, and
often greatly diverse, ways. Put another way, the assertion can be made that
there is always more than one way to approach a given problem.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problem formulation further differs from traditional
functional diagramming in that it includes harmful events and conditions as well
as useful ones. The developers of the problem formulation process, Boris Zlotin
and Alla Zusman, determined that by combining functional diagramming, which
addresses useful functions, and Ishikawa (“fishbone”) diagramming, which
deals with harmful functions, new benefits could be realized (see Figure 2).
Figure 2, one of several diagrams developed by the DTM team, was leveraged
through the use of a patented software algorithm that provides an exhaustive set
of <i>Directions for Innovation</i>, replacing the need for trial-and-error
attempts. The Directions for Innova­tion are the representation of a single,
complex problem by a set of simple (and more easily solved) problems. In effect,
problem formulation constitutes a “map” of the problem situation (i.e., the
events and conditions that constitute or relate to the problem) in terms of
cause-and-effect relationships.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problem Modeling and Knowledge Conversion</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is occurring when we model a problem situation? For most
of us, the knowledge we possess about a particular problem (or any situation) is
not segmented into precise, orderly units that can be easily represented with
pencil and paper, or even with a computer. Rather, it resembles a monolith of
complicated interconnections and “chunks” of information, intermixed with an
assortment of associations from the useful (possible solutions, analogous
situations, similar problems, etc.) to the distracting (such as emotional
factors or extraneous job-related issues).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Modeling a problem is a process - sometimes a lengthy one -
of converting this mass of mental data into an ordered collection of sequential
“knowledge units,” and of determining the relationships between these units.
A reasonably modeled problem can convey all the necessary information about a
problem situation - and then some.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The benefits of problem modeling as incorporated in the
problem formulation process are as follows:</p>
</font>
<blockquote>
  <font FACE="Wingdings" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">§</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">Its use
  provides increased understanding of a problem situation and thus affirms the
  TRIZ adage: “A correctly formulated problem is a problem that is nearly
  solved.” Moreover, the building of models that reveal an exhaustive set of
  Directions for Innovation is an expeditious way to gain this increased
  understanding, making the modeling process a “quick learning” tool.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">§</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">Within the
  exhaustive set of Directions for Innovation generated by the problem

  likely have been overlooked.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">§</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">The process
  helps to break down psychological inertia by providing a means for the user to

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The “Language” of Functions and Links</b></font><font FACE="Arial Unicode MS" LANG="JA" SIZE="2"></p>
</font><font SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem formulation model is composed of two main
elements: <i>functions </i>and <i>links</i>. A function consists of a box that
includes text describing something about the problem or system. Functions
represent an event or condition in the form of an action, component, condition,
process step, etc. A link, represented by an arrow, describes the relationship
between two functions.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are four types of links in the model:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">Provides (a
  single line arrow)</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">Causes (a
  double line arrow)</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">Hinders (a
  double line arrow with a crossbar)</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">Eliminates (a
  single line arrow with a crossbar)</p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These simple ingredients provide the “language” necessary
to adequately describe any problem situation for the purpose of developing
solution concepts. The situation can be either technical or non-technical; the
latter opens the door to working with business process improvement and
re-engineering situations.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note: In Figure 2, only two of the above four links are used:
provides (a single line arrow) and hinders (a double line arrow with a
crossbar). There are four boxes in this diagram (2a, 2b, 2c and 2d) that provide
a useful while also hindering something - these boxes have desirable
characteristics but also produce harmful effects. This situation is referred to
in TRIZ as a <i>contradiction</i>.</p>

<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Directions for Innovation - What Are They?</b></font><font FACE="Arial Unicode MS" LANG="JA" SIZE="2"></p>
</font><font SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the reasons complicated problems are difficult to
solve is that they cannot be solved “in a single shot” - indeed, attempts to
do so prove frustrating and fruitless. The experience of succes­sful inventors
shows that complex problems require a multi-faceted approach, something that the
“normal” mental process cannot effectively accom­modate.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To support solving of complex problems, the Ideation Process
helps separate them into a set of simple problems known as Directions for
Innovation. Successive tackling of these problems is the equivalent of the
multi-faceted approach used by successful inventors. This approach consists of
looking at a problem situation from all possible points of view.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">STEP 3. PRIORITIZATION OF DIRECTIONS FOR INNOVATION AND
GENERATION OF IDEAS</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DTM’s Subject Matter Experts prioritized the directions by
visual analysis of the Problem Formulation diagram, and then selected the
directions of particular interest.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once Directions for Innovation had been prioritized the
Innovation WorkBench</font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">Ô</font><font SIZE="2">
System software was used to generate ideas.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Utilization of a Structured Knowledge Base</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As was stated earlier, TRIZ is a science - one that has
resulted from over 50 years of research. This research is ongoing and, to date,
consists of the extraction and structurization of knowledge from two primary
sources: over two million worldwide patents, and the history of technology
itself. Research has been the identified principles, methods and patterns that
have recurred time and again throughout history. The extent and complexity of
this accumulated knowledge was the driving force for using computer technology
in order to efficiently and effectively put this wealth of knowledge to use.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For technological problems such as the one resolved by DTM,
access to this knowledge base provides a significant advantage over traditional
brainstorming, which is typically dependent on the talent of the facilitator and
the knowledge of the participants. By integrating the process of problem
formulation (including the generation of Directions for Innovation) with the use
of an extensive knowledge base, the DTM team had the ability to quickly focus
their creative abilities on specific information directly related to their
situation.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Figure 3 shows the structure of the Innovation WorkBench™
System software developed by Ideation International Inc. This software
incorporates the Ideation Process, which in turn encompasses the Problem
Formulation process. In Figure 3, the rectangular nodes represent analytical
tools, the oval nodes represent knowledge-base tools, the cloud node represents
the accumulation of ideas and secondary problems, and the rounded-corner nodes
indicate those components of the software that support the effective conversion
of ideas into implementable concepts. The final component of the software,
denoted by the star-shaped node, represents the part of the process where
implementation of the final concept(s) is analyzed and planned.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cloud-shaped node in Figure 3 represents a significant
point of differentiation between the Ideation Process and traditional
brainstorming. Traditional brainstorming (which is based on the work of Alex
Osborn) separates idea generation from the critique and evaluation of the ideas.
Extensive psychological research by TRIZ scientists has revealed that this is
effective for solving low-level problems, but not for solving complex
technological problems. These findings are based on two factors:</p>
<blockquote>
</font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">·</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">It is “natural”
for humans to critique ideas as they occur - efforts to block this natural
ten­dency has a psychological effect on the indi­vidual that hinders the
natural creative process.</p>
</font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">·</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">By stating and
documenting secondary problems, we accomplish two things; first, we clear the
mind to think freely about new ideas; and two, we “charge” the mind with
secondary problems. This process of “charging the mind” prepares us to solve
problems which, in many cases, are easily solved (in fact, secondary problems
are often easier to solve than the primary one to which they relate). When
working with TRIZ, we are continuously reformulating problems and solving both
primary and secondary problems. This process allows for the development of a
broad cross-section of ideas and, when necessary, a nearly exhaustive set of
ideas can be developed into an exhaustive set of concepts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DTM team diligently followed this process, continually
expanding their knowledge and charging their minds with the information required
to solve not one but several problems.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="fig3.jpg" width="720" height="449"></font><font SIZE="2"></p>
<p>STEP 4. DEVELOPMENT OF CONCEPTS</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In preparation for developing concepts, the DTM team utilized
affinity diagramming to group ideas. The team then followed this process by
creating a matrix, which allowed them to quantify each of the ideas based on a
predetermined set of success criteria. The actual results of the team’s work
are confidential and therefore cannot be published. What is critical, however,
is that the team followed each step of the Ideation Process as defined in the
remainder of this case study.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rationale for this part (i.e., “Development of Concepts”)
of the Ideation Process is the notion that it is a rare occurrence that one idea
resolves a complex, multi-faceted problem. Thus, a complex situation is split
into a set of different Directions for Innovation, where each Direction
represents one point of view rather than the entire complex “picture.” As a
result, each idea does not represent the solution to the entire problem, but the
entire set of ideas does indeed cover all possibilities.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because each idea resolves a different aspect of the problem,
the ideas must be combined into new, innovative concepts. An analysis of the
ideas that have been generated supports the classification of ideas based on
certain “combination criteria,” which include two options:</p>
<blockquote>
</font><font FACE="Wingdings" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">v</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">1. Combining
ideas that perform the same function in different ways</p>
</font><font FACE="Wingdings" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">v</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">2. Combining
known systems</p>
<blockquote>
</font><font FACE="Wingdings" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ø</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">2a. Combine
systems having the same functions</p>
</font><font FACE="Wingdings" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ø</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">2b. Combine
systems having opposite functions</p>
</font><font FACE="Wingdings" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ø</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">2c. Create a
system from homogeneous elements</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each of the above options can be explained in more detail, as
follows:</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Combining ideas that perform the same function in
different ways</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The approach of combining ideas that perform the same
function in different ways assumes that each idea has its own advantages and
disadvantages. As a result, the new idea should have all of these advantages and
no disadvantages. Achieving this entails the following steps:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Select two ideas that resolve the same problem in
    different ways.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. Compare these ideas; each has its own advantages.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. Consider the idea that has better functional features
    as the “source of resources”; the other idea is the “recipient of
    resources.”</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. Determine the elements that provide better
    functionality of the source idea.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. Apply these elements to the recipient.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6. Consider if some elements of the recipient can perform
    functions of the newly-applied elements, and simplify the system.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7. As the best result, the new system should consist of
    elements of the recipient and have features of the source.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. Combining known systems</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This option is used when we know at least two other existing
systems that perform the same (or opposite) function, or that have been designed
for the same (or opposite) purpose. To utilize this option, consider the
following pathways:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2a. <i>Combine systems having the same functions</p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In most situations, more than one existing system has been
designed for the same purpose, but the systems have different principles of
operation. Usually, these two situations have different (sometimes opposite)
advantages and drawbacks. Quite often it is possible to combine two systems in a
manner that maintains or adds advantages, while compensating for the drawbacks.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To find a way to combine two systems, consider the following
principles:</p>
<blockquote>
</font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">·</font><font SIZE="1"> </font><font SIZE="2">Bi-system

bi-system</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2b. </font><font FACE="Arial Unicode MS" LANG="JA">Combine systems having
opposite functions</p>
</font><font SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This option entails the integration of two systems that have
opposite functions (i.e., serve opposite purposes). The functions of the new
system can often be more precisely controlled.</p>
<i>
<p>2c. Create a system from homogeneous elements</p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Usually, several similar elements have the same features as
one element. If, however, these elements are combined to form a new system, new
features often appear. In the new system, none of the elements have these
features - only the system does. Two types of such a system can be created:</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Increased Complexity followed by Simplification</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When combining ideas, functions, and systems, the result is
often an increasingly complex (sometimes monstrous) design concept. DTM’s team
found the next step to be a natural one, as they proceeded through a process of
simplification that might incorporate one or more of the following
recommendations that they found in the software:</p>
<blockquote>
</font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">

disposable objects</p>

</blockquote>
<p>STEP 5. EVALUATION OF RESULTS</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Evaluating the results lead the DTM team to the culmination
of the five-step Ideation Process. This final step ensures that the concept(s)
have been thoroughly thought out and is implementable. There are three stages to
this process:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Meet criteria for evaluating concepts</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></p>
</font><font SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. Reveal and prevent potential failures</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. Plan the implementation</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These stages are designed to provide criteria guidelines
(through the use of a checklist of possible secondary problems) which include
the following:</p>
<blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second part of the Evaluation of Results step lead the
team to a means for predicting possible failures that could occur when the new
concept is put to use. This process of revealing hidden harmful conditions is
based on an aggressive approach of <i>inventing the harmful conditions</i>, and
is known as Anticipatory Failure Determination™.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lastly, the DTM team was concerned with potential problems
related to the actual implementation of the concept. This included identifying
roadblocks to implementation, verification tests, and R&amp;D needs. It also
included the use of Anticipatory Failure Determination™ to predict potential
failures that can occur during the implementation process.</p>
<b><u>
<p>SUMMARY</p>
</u></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DTM’s successful application of the Ideation Process,
combined with the talent, dedication, and engineering know-how of the DTM team
lead to the successful resolution of this problem and has lead to the training
of two additional teams. The training and problem solving model is as follows:</p>

critical factors in the process, and lead to the successful completion of this
project.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ideation Process and Innovation WorkBench</font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">Ô</font><font SIZE="2">
System software provide a structured, systematic approach that utilizes both
analytical and knowledge-base tools. These tools, along with appropriate
training and coaching to support the lessons learned, were used diligently by
the team to solve a previously unsolvable seven year old problem and the
coaching is ensuring a high level of self-sufficiency in inventive problem
solving is developed.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The utilization of a structured questionnaires, and of a
software-based problem formulation process that reveals an exhaustive set of
Directions for Innovation, will enhance the creative results of even the best
brainstorming sessions by ensuring that all possible Directions are considered.
Further benefits can be realized by utilizing the results of extensive research
and its structurization in the form of a unique and powerful database of
easy-to-use knowledge extracted from the world’s patent fund and the history
of technology.</p>
