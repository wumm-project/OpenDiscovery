<p align="JUSTIFY">Social and economic situations in the former USSR since the
late 1980s urged or forced many TRIZ specialists, who had much experience
applying TRIZ to technical problems, to change their main activity field into
services, business management, etc. and they are still using TRIZ.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Main interests in interviewing these people are: what aspects
of TRIZ can be used and what kind of extensions of TRIZ are necessary in the new
fields of business-related areas?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Sergey Faer, (St. Petersburg, Russia) changed his dedication
from technology to advertisement and Public Relations area in 1990 and now he is
working actively as chief of a political consultant group. He is a developer of
more than thirty advertising campaigns for various firms and services. As part
of his career he has successfully organized fourteen election campaigns in the
past several years.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Sergey Faer has elaborated and tested in political campaigns
140 methods and stratagems. Many of the 73 tactical methods and stratagems,
described in his book &quot;Methods of Strategy and Tactics of Election
Campaign&quot; (1998), are published for the first time. They are entitled by
original names and explained with formulation, comments and even with his own
statements of each problem written with poetic diction of Japanese haiku-style
poetry. There is specially allocated the essence of each method - the aspect of
contradiction, and formulation demonstrates that maximal task (contradiction),
which the given method is capable to solve.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Besides, the widely known methods are submitted also in the
book. They are marked by *. Some of them meet in the literature under the
different names. In this case author has kept the most common name. <b><i>Attention:</i></b>
a stratagem is more than the tactical method, but is less than a strategy. A
stratagem is a system of several coordinated tactical methods. <b><i>One more
remark</i></b>: The presence of methods does not exempt from the solution of
tasks. Sometimes it happens that the use of a method can cause the necessity of
solution of a new subtask, smaller than basic, on scale. It's not the reason for
refusal of method. The meaning of a new subtask is reduced to retention of
pluses of the solution and elimination of the appeared minuses. Typical mistake
- the attempt to find the one method solving all problems at once.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This book is intended for those who are engaged in election
campaigns of the candidates for the presidents, for the governors and for the
deputies of various levels, as that: candidates, strategy developers,
Image-makers, Public Relations experts, election campaigns managers, the
advisers for management in crisis situations.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">While talking to him, being in St. Petersburg, Dr. Toru
Nakagawa (Professor of the Preparatory Office for Faculty of Information
Science, Osaka, Gakuin University, the editor of &quot;TRIZ Home Page in
Japan&quot; E-mail: nakagawa@utc.osaka-gu.ac.jp) recalled the 36 tactics
stratagems written in ancient Chinese literatures, and Sergey Faer showed him
his citation of them at the end of his book.</p>
<b><u>
<p align="CENTER">Here are some of these valid methods functioning already for
three millenniums:</p>
</u></b>
<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">To make noise in the east, to attack in the west</li>
    <li>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">To extract something from nothing</li>
    <li>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">To hide a dagger behind a smile</li>
    <li>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">To be unified with a distant enemy to win near</li>
    <li>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">To do mad gestures, not losing balance</li>
    <li>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">To decorate dry trees with artificial flowers</li>
    <li>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">To transform a role of the visitor into a role of the
      host</li>
    <li>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The plum tree dries up instead of peach</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;They are similar to invisible knives which are hidden in a human brain
and sparkle only when you decide to apply them. The human life is a struggle,
and in a struggle, the stratagems are necessary. Each man stands on the
front-line. The one who is able to apply stratagems, always will keep the
initiative in his hands. Military people and scientists, merchants and diplomats
- are using them. In a palace or in a hootch they are always useful. They should
be carefully hidden from the foreigners&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"></p>

  president 1996-2000 &quot;. (Truth, with a clause: Yeltsin correctly
  dismisses, correctly nominates, and in general come back to life only at the

  find) in the person of the metropolitan punks which not only are going to
  support his nominee on a post of the president but also have begun one of
  these days pre-election propaganda in his advantage. The leaflets of the punks

<p align="CENTER">- How to distinguish political advertising from commodity
advertising?</p>
</b>
<p>- In commodity advertising there is no direct struggle even at the moment of
a fierce competition between different trade marks. Despite of it, the strong
methodology of commodity marketing has penetrated into politics and killed there
those important things, which are possible only in the personal struggle.</p>
<b>
<p>- Where it’s possible to use the methods described in your book
&quot;Strategic and tactical methods of an election campaign&quot;?</p>
<p>- </b>Everywhere, where the competitive struggle is: intraparty strife,
struggle for the good position, for the large salary, for management posts and
so on. The artist and proofreader of my book have told me, that if they could
have read this book earlier, it would help them to carve out a career for
themselves.</p>
<b>
<p>- As I have seen, commodity and political advertising are differently
developing in time. What is an election? The achievement of the fixed result in
some period. In commodity advertising the victory is unstable condition. As soon
as you have stopped - you have lost. Your book is divided into two parts -
tactical and strategic. How to proceed from the knowledge of separate methods to
the strategic intellection?</p>
</b>
<p>- The strategy is emerging itself, when you are immersing in information. At
some moment the information will &quot; spill over &quot;, and the picture of
strategy will develop itself. Looking from higher system level, you can see all
problems in their interrelation, and can find the necessary actions, when one
problem will solve another.</p>

<b><u>
<p align="CENTER">&quot; POLITICAL TRICKSTERS &quot; IN RUSSIA</p>
</u></b>
<p>- <b>How long were you writing the book?</p>
</b>
<p>- Two years. I have elaborated 140 stratagems. There are 73 in the book, I
have not found of vivid examples for others. When I began to write the book, I
had only 20 stratagems from my elective experience. Since I have described them,
I understood that it is only beginning and it is necessary to search further.</p>
<b>
<p>- Which statesman has given the greater amount of examples?</p>

<p>- Mostly those who on hearing - Luzhkov, Nemtsov, Zhirinovskiy, Lebed. Some
time back, when Nemtsov was the governor of the Nizhniy Novgorod area, he has
got popularity all over the country due to inventive, not demanding expenses
occasions. And how Zhirinovskiy is working? The essence of his main stratagem is
(on my classification): &quot; All should be concordant, consonant, co-coloured.
The falseness is beaten out from chorus &quot;. If all people &quot;yes&quot;,
he is alone - &quot;against&quot;, and always wins on it.</p>
<b>
<p>- Which stratagems are most popular among Russian statesmans?</p>
</b>
<p>- Most simple stratagem- from the hyping category &quot;Attraction and
retention of attention&quot;. It works with culture and sports, they are often
near to politics. It is not expensive to statesmans and the effect is good. The
most widespread pre-election policy - is a chain of creation of information
occasions &quot;out of thin air&quot;. For example, scene-stealer Zhirinovskiy
perfectly wields this method, but it is impossible for someone else to repeat
it: which is possible for &quot;hooligan&quot; - is inadmissible for the hero
with positive image, for which to work on public as effectively, but &quot; in
an atmosphere of plus &quot; - a task more difficult. Luzhkov tries to do the
same, but he works with big spending, all his information occasions cost dearly.</p>
<b>
<p>- And Lebed works inventively? This history with the invitation of Alen Delon
in Krasnoyarsk during pre-election campaign …</p>
</b>
<p>- Lebed is brave, he has learned to adhere to that image which has resulted
him in success, but he has lost the ingenuity when has come out from a disfavour.
And earlier there were interesting ploys one behind another. Remember a case,
when he has arrived on inauguration of Bill Clinton, ostensibly invited by one
of the Congressmans? Clinton, knowing that Lebed is in disfavour, did not want
to look poorly before Yeltsyn, and apologetically said, &quot;we did not invite
Lebed&quot;. What a boom was worked up! The artful trick, and I’m familiar
with its author - (he reviewed my book), former scout, he helped Lebed in that
difficult period. And now, when his hand on a pulse of the whole region, it is
difficult for him to be inventive.</p>
<p>After a statesman has achieved something, then the real businesses, instead
of virtual occasions, are required from him. Now, for example, Yavlinsky -
&quot;in white clothes &quot;, in not responsible post, he has the large field
for an ingenuity, for treatment of events. As soon as he will receive authority
- he will turn in Lebed which, being a man set in authority and therefore
responsibility, now can only to adhere to the image. To be the inventor in
authority - it is a talent of a high order, and a few people are able to do it.</p>
<b>
<p>- In Russia &quot;inventors&quot; in authority frequently solve a tasks of
personal enrichment, the experience of last years shows also, that some
innovations have resulted in fall of a living standard of the population and in
economic crisis …</b></p>
<p>- I shall bring an example of the strong positive decision from experience of
the United States. Some tens years back there were imposed a new tax on the
vacuum contained in closed vessels. The formulation sounds very modestly, but in
consequence of this well elaborated invention of &quot; those who in authority
&quot; was the breaktrough in the field of new technologies of
microminiaturization! The vacuum lamps then became simple not profitably for
making. A society in an advantage: the applied and fundamental science develops,
the new workplaces are created.<b></p>

<p align="CENTER">ELECTIONS IN KARELIYA AS A MIRROR OF THE RUSSIAN POLITICAL
ADVERTISING</p>
</u><i>
<p>- </i>I know, that you are an empiric, and make pre-election campaigns. For
example, this spring you worked on election of the Head of Government of the
Karelian Republic (it's a part of Russia). Please tell about this case.</p>
</b>
<p>- It is a theme for separate clause, and here we can tell only a little... It
was the election of the chairman of Government of the Karelian Republic. We were
running short of time - there was a month before election, our candidate - the
known man, mayor of Petrozavodsk (capital city of Karelian Republic), Katanandov.
Our competitor on these elections was the previous Head of Republic, communist
Stepanov. Within eight years people loved Katanandov as Luzhkov in Moskow, for
eight years he was the mayor, remarkable mayor.</p>
<p>Four months prior to our arrival one of the Moscow consulting teams with the
help of unfair methods of antiadvertising has reduced his image almost to zero.
This is the style of their work on all Russia - &quot;destruction&quot; of the
competitor. On all Kareliya tens circulations of two free-of-charge newspapers
with defaming of our candidate were distributed. Through the newspapers and
through the special people the hearings were started - we counted them
approximately 150. The hearings were stratified: for the soldier - one, for the
grandmothers - others, for the Byelorussians - third, for the students - fourth.
That during authority he will expel the Byelorussians and Ukrainians from
republic, that will disperse military formations, that rural population
shouldn't enter the city Colleges and Universities - they should plant a field,
milk the cows… These hearings, we are sure, were already fulfilled in other
regions of Russia. They were spoken that he is bootlegger, gangster, defiler of
minds… all was listed - even that he is a &quot;gay&quot;. And the people
believed. Eight years loved, and now within four months the man has turned to
nothing …</p>
<b>
<p>- It is classics. Slander is the strong weapon. The people usually consider
that &quot; there is no smoke without fire &quot;, something can correspond to
the reality … Moreover, the more successful hearing is more interesting for
retelling, if it’s about all the favourite man.</p>
</b>
<p>- And how to struggle against these hearings? It is senseless to show any
informations and references that he is not a &quot;gangster&quot;,
&quot;defiler&quot; and not a &quot;gay&quot;. Competitor used a &quot;Turned
mirror&quot;, favourite stratagem among many politicians- to accuse the
competitor of what you doing youself. In mass media Stepanov's team declared:
Katanandov is bad, he foul Stepanov's name. The Karelians - the quiet people of
sluggish disposition, they love the nature of their native land … And suddenly
- five months of such a dirt are dumped on them! They were tired of it all, they
already feel no difference - whether Katanandov is rights or not: &quot; all
candidates are bad &quot; … Katanandov campaigned honourly and never &quot;
has stepped on a leg &quot; of the competitor, but people say: &quot; they all
pour a dirt against each other &quot;.</p>
<p>We have made such a strategic conclusion for ourselves: it is meaningless
&quot;to scrub &quot; through logic, we will not &quot;wash&quot; each concrete
hearing - we will burst toward the heart. There already were 150 hearings about
- well, let it ride. It is necessary to make people believe by heart, that all
these hearings are nonsense …</p>
<p>Our first television roller turned on local TV only one day - opponents
quickly have taken it off the air. Because it has worked! On all Kareliya they
searched for those who has made a roller, a copy even have taken in Moscow on
examination - on hundreds pages of the report professors proved that it is
necessary to take this roller off because it's a psychotropic weapon. At that
moment it have been removed for a long time, and by then we already have made
ten other rollers.</p>
<p>How was it looked? Under a penetrating into the soul music from one French
movie, where a long beginning on one note, - the absolute white screen, and from
above is lowered slowly the utter darkness - the dark screen. The narrator's
voice-over: &quot; The Authority is all-powerful. The flows of a dirt will fall
upon the one who is worthy of replace it. Think, listen and look, - upon whom it
has fallen now &quot;… All screen is dark …</p>
<p>There were other rollers, where we have kept white - dark scale: &quot; From
love up to hatred … Stop, think, make a step … &quot; - and screen again is
white.</p>
<p>Ours Katanandov has won this election.</p>
<b>
<p>- You have refused antiadvertising?</p>
</b>
<p>- I did not carry on any elective campaign with antiadvertising.
Counterpropaganda is acceptable, but as a protection. I admit antiadvertising
only when the competitor antiadvertise himself. On any election competitor is
compromised enough, gives enough resources to transform it into antiadvertising.
So it's not necessary to search for any damning evidence. All my book - is a
counterstroke upon those &quot;advisers&quot;, which are engaged in
&quot;dark&quot; election campaigns. In my book I told how it's possible to be
&quot;rationally&quot; protected from antiadvertising, &quot;to reduce&quot; the
competitors and not to dirty the hands. Do you know the whence of all dirt in
our political marketing? Somewhere at the beginning of &quot;Perestroika&quot;
(reorganization) have appeared the first election teams with ideas: &quot;the
elections - is war&quot;, and &quot;all is fair in war&quot;. The psychology of
such adviser is simple: I'm a good man home, but elections is a job and I'm
different there - it's necessary to be cold, pragmatic…</p>
<p>The slander is the strong weapon, but there is other powerful means - of
humour, against which is hard to resist to anybody. I have told a history about
the &quot;Apple&quot; posters in any city, there was an inscription: &quot;Young
generation chooses an Apple &quot;. The opponent used labels of a small format,
which were glued to the posters: &quot;… and drinks Pepsi-Cola&quot;.</p>
<b>
<p>- Whether it was possible to use humour in such, on a side, situation, what
was in Kareliya?</p>
</b>
<p>- At that moment, when there was a dirt in Kareliya, our hands did not rise
to write send-up songs, gags - it was not that the situation demanded. It is my
belief that the adviser should be as a tuning fork. When I work, I
&quot;become&quot; the voter myself. I use the environment and, as a tuning
fork, I begin to sound according to it. Projecting the advertising action, I
listen to myself - whether it resonating with me or disharmonizing … Only in
the second round we launched humour, when have felt that is possible - because
have already answered to aggression. By well-known voices of Lebed, Yeltsin,
Zhirinovskiy we talked to all Kareliya and its government. There were made
approximately 50 radio-rollers. The competitor declared, that ours Katanandov
fills in all TV-channels, and on TV they do not show him, Stepanov. This method,
already familiar to us, was the &quot;Turned mirror&quot;, because the situation
was opposite - on TV was Stepanov. The advertising of him was sustained in
socialist spirit. Imagine on the Soviet motive &quot;a song to build and to live
helps to us&quot;, &quot;Stepanov Victor is simple and reliable! &quot;,
&quot;Stability&quot;, &quot;Stability&quot;, and once again
&quot;Stability&quot;! The main slogan of Stepanov was &quot;Stability&quot;.</p>
<p>And - our roller on radio:</p>
<p>Telephone ringing, and voice of Gorbatchev with characteristic soft
intonation: &quot;Call The Main, please. We looked your telecast. You are for
stability … But I know, that the most stable position of a ball - when it is
in &quot;at pit&quot;... So how comes it? It's a complete Stabilitism turns
out?!&quot; … (in original - here is also the rhyme with one Russian funny
word)</p>
<p>We worked on radio, on discos. The youth needed to be bringing on elections -
they were brought.</p>
<b>
<p>- What else methods were used in Kareliya?</p>
</b>
<p>- We used the method &quot;An absurdity carried to its ultimate&quot; - Get
the advertising of the competitor up to the point of irrationality by its
amplification. In the first day, when we have arrived, - the Election Staff was
idle, nobody knows what to do with those flows of a dirt against our client - we
have offered the most simple, that it was possible to make. We have taken all
newspapers that have been letting out by competitors, and have collected them on
one sheet of paper: in one column - the laudatory excerptions about Stepanov,
and in another column - the excerptions from the same newspapers about our
Katanandov. All excerptions have been done with the references to real numbers
of the newspapers. The man reads - and thinks: &quot;O! My God!&quot;. It was
not necessary to think too much, - we simply have reduced on one sheet
everything, that was scattered on circulations of the newspapers - the led up to
the point of irrationality positive and lead up to the point of irrationality
negative. We did not begin even to bring in the estimation - everyone will
understand. Instantly it went to the newspapers with heading: &quot; Only facts
&quot;.</p>
<p align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
<b><u>
<p align="CENTER">PROSPECTS OF POLITICAL ADVERTISING</p>
</u>
<p>- Is the election advertising in Russia varies?</p>
</b>
<p>- It progresses, all becomes more complex. Already it is impossible to
compare two years - old election campaigns with that occurs now. The creativity
has changed very strongly, the analytics. The advisers become smarter.</p>
<b>
<p>- How to build a campaign during crisis?</p>
</b>
<p>- To work not dividing voters - for all people at once, standing on universal
positions. Using the thesis of the &quot; political consent &quot;, which now
becomes fashionable.</p>
<b>
<p>- That is, to use a need of the population for rest, just as it working in
commodity advertising? All are speaking about the special mentality of the
Russians. How do you think, it is necessary to address to feelings or reason in
Russia?</p>
</b>
<p>- It is necessary to ring the all bells, using both logic and feelings! And
the specific decision will be prompted by a situation.</p>
