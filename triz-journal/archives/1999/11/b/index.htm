<p><b>1 Introduction</b></p>
<p>Throughout the history of human knowledge, there have been two conceptions
concerning the law of development of the universe, the idealistic conception and
the materialistic conception, which form two opposite world outlooks. TRIZ
ideology is based on 2 major cornerstones: Contradiction and Ideality - these
global concepts and their application in engineering will be described here. As
it is well known, the Contradiction is the basic law of materialist dialectics,
and the second cornerstone is the essence of the idealism. These two opposite
philosophic approaches are united in TRIZ that use their mutual co-operation.
Perhaps, this amalgamate predetermines the unique power of TRIZ. The concepts of
Ideality and/or Contradiction should be consciously included in any process of
solving the inventive problems. Hence we consider these main TRIZ concepts in
this and the next Lessons.<br>
</p>
<p><b>2 Contradictions: Ontology</b><br>
</p>
<p>The contradiction means literally &quot;saying 'No'&quot;, but more generally
refers to the propositions that assert apparently incompatible or opposite
things. George Berkeley introduced the contradiction concept in the famous book
&quot;A treatise concerning the principles of human knowledge&quot; in 1710. As
the main point of critique of the formal logic developed by G.W.F. Hegel between
1812 and 1816, contradiction is the most popular concept for introducing
dialectical ideas. For example, F. Engels wrote at the end of the XIXth century
that the unity (interpenetration) of opposites is a basic law of dialectics, and
V. I. Lenin said about it: &quot;The splitting of a single whole and the
cognition of its contradictory parts is the essence ... of dialectics&quot;.
Lenin draws attention to the fact that the contradiction is central not just to
&quot;logic&quot; (as normally understood) but to cognition (analysis), and that
the dialectical concept of contradiction is not the contradiction between two
things external to one another, but the contradiction which is at the essence of
a thing. According to the dialectics contradictoriness within a thing is the
fundamental cause of its development, and they have a universal presence in many
fields. In the work &quot;On the Question of Dialectics&quot;<font size="-1"> </font>V.I
Lenin illustrated the universality of mutually contradictory phenomena as
follows:</p>
<p>in mathematics: plus and minus, differential and integral;</p>
<p>in physics: positive and negative electrical charges, mechanical action and
reaction;</p>
<p>in chemistry: the combination and dissociation of atoms;</p>
<p>in war: offense and defense, victory and fault;</p>
<p>and stressed that one contradiction cannot exist without the other.<br>
</p>
<p>As mentioned before, TRIZ states that often the most effective inventive
solution of a problem is such solution that overcomes some contradictions. The
contradiction occurs when we are trying to improve one parameter or
characteristic of a technique (a technical system - TS or/and a technological
process -TP) and then the same or other characteristics or parameters of the
technique are affected negatively.</p>
<p>When a solver has extracted a contradiction in the problem that fits into the
classes defined above it became easy to find a variety of creative and effective
solutions of this problem. But usually a problem is NOT solved if its
contradiction is NOT overcome as it shown in the following example:</p>
<p><i>A new and more powerful engine is installed at an airplane in order to
increase the speed of the airplane. This engine increases the total weight of
the airplane. However, the wings now cannot support the heavier airplane during
take off. So, the size of the wings is increased. Now, there is more drag force
that slows down the airplane.</i></p>
<p>The goal is not achieved here. This happens because the central contradiction
was not resolved. A solver should keep or strengthen the characteristic (<i>speed</i>)
in such a way that to keep or improve other properties (<i>weight, wings size</i>).
This way is almost always non-obvious for solution and assumes some creativity
of a problem solver, or …… just the knowledge of TRIZ and experience in this
methodology. In contrast to a routine design that leads to a smoothing of the
contradiction (the current TRADE-OFF dogma) and/or choosing one of the
preferable combinations in conflict (the <b>OR</b>... <b>OR</b> principle), a
design based on TRIZ aspires to permit and solve the contradiction, creating
system, in which the improvement of one characteristics is not accompanied by
deterioration of others (the <b>AND</b>... <b>AND</b> dogma, a new paradigm that
perhaps will be the leading in the future engineering).</p>
<p>G. S. Altshuller [1] distinguished the following three types of
contradictions:<br>
</p>
</p><ul>
  <p>A). <b>Administrative</b> contradictions:</p>
</ul>
<p>Something is required to make, to receive some result, to avoid the
undesirable phenomenon, but it is not known how to achieve the result. <i>For
example, we want to increase quality of production and decrease cost of raw
materials. </i>Such form of a problem reminds one of an inventive situation. The
administrative contradiction itself is provisional, has no heuristic value, and
does not show a direction to the answer.</p>
</p><ul>
  <p><br>
  B). <b>Technical </b>contradictions:</p>
</ul>
<p>An action is simultaneously useful and harmful or it causes Useful Function(s)
and Harmful Function(s) /UF and HF/; the introduction (or amplification) of the
useful action or the recession (or easing) of the harmful effect leads to
deterioration of some subsystems or the whole system, <i>e.g., an inadmissible
complexity of the system.</i></p>
<p>The technical contradiction represents the conflict between TWO SUBSYSTEMS of
a system. <i>For example, we want to increase the penetration depth of ions into
a semiconductor and decrease the electrical power (energy source) that is
necessary for the ion implanter operation.</i></p>
<p>Such contradictions occur if:</p>
<p>- the creation (intensification) of the useful function in one subsystem
causes the creation of new harmful function or the intensification of the
existing harmful function in another subsystem;</p>
<p>- the elimination (reduction) of the harmful function in one subsystem causes
the deterioration of the useful function in another subsystem;</p>
<p>- the intensification of the useful function or reduction of the harmful
function in one subsystem causes the unacceptable complication of other
subsystem or even the whole technique.<br>
</p>
</p><ul>
  <p>C). <b>Physical</b> contradictions:</p>
</ul>
<p>A given subsystem (element) should have the property A to execute necessary
function and the property non-A /anti-A/ to satisfy the conditions of a problem.</p>
<p>The physical contradiction implies inconsistent requirements to a physical
condition OF THE SAME element of a Technical System (TS) or operation of a
Technological Process (TP), i.e., the same key subsystem of a technique. <i>For
example, we want that an insulator in semiconductor chips has low dielectric
constant <b><font size="-1">k </font></b>in order to reduce parasitic capacities
and we want that insulator in semiconductor chips has high dielectric constant <b><font size="-1">k
</font></b>in order to store information better.</i><br>
</p>
<p>Such contradictions occurs also if:</p>
<p>- the intensification of the useful function in a subsystem causes the
simultaneously intensification of the existing harmful function in the same key
subsystem;</p>
<p>- the reduction of the harmful function in a subsystem causes the
simultaneously reduction of the useful function in the same key subsystem.</p>
<p><i>For example, if the gate bias voltage increases a metal-oxide
semiconductor transistor can have bigger threshold voltage (good for power
MOSFETs) but the transistor will operate at lower frequencies (bad); if the gate
bias voltage decreases a metal-oxide semiconductor transistor can operate at
higher frequencies (good) but the high-speed changes of the gate voltage will
lead to unanticipated triggering of the transistor (bad).</i></p>
<p>The physical contradictions as well as the technical contradictions are
usually crystallized during the special problem analysis that will be described
particularly in the Lesson 18. Sometime the technical contradictions can be
obtained by analysis of technique in the framework of Root Cause Analysis or
Goldratt's Theory of Constraints [2, 3].<br>
</p>
<p>According to G.S. Altshuller [1] an inventive situation is usually inherent
in some groups of the technical and/or physical contradictions in the technique.
The choice of the certain contradiction from the group means transition from an
inventive situation to the beginning of the problem solution. Successful
formulation of the physical contradiction shows usually the problem's nucleus.
The contradiction is extremely intensified in this case, that often makes the
problem's solution straightforward. Let illustrate the simplification of a
problem along with the names of logical operators for two most common
contradictions in TRIZ</p>
<p><i><u>The administrative contradiction:</u></i></p>
<p><i>It is necessary to detect the number of small &lt; 0.3 micrometers
particles in a liquid with very high optical purity. Particles reflect light
very badly even if we use a laser.</i></p>
<p><i>What to do?</i></p>
<p><i><u>The technical contradiction</u></i></p>
<p><i>If the particles are very small the liquid stays optical pure, but the
particles are invisible. <b>XOR </b>if the particles are big they are
detectable, but the liquid is not pure.</i></p>
<p><i><u>The physical contradiction:</u></i></p>
<p><i>The particles has to increase their sizes to be viewed <b>ANDNOT</b> to
increase the sizes to keep the optical purity of the liquid.</i></p>
<p>After such transition we reduce the difficulty of the problem.</p>
<p>It is possible to label the so-called <b>physical</b> contradictions as <b>ANDNOT
operator</b> and present the so-called <b>technical</b> contradictions through <b>XOR
operators, </b>but these terms are not common in TRIZ researches yet.<br>
</p>
<p>The set of contradictions proposed by G.S. Altshuller [1] is not full for
various problems outside engineering [5].</p>
<p>In general various contradictions can be separated into three major groups:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Natural,
  <li>Social,
  <li>Engineering.</li>
</ul>
<p>A more detail scheme of contradictions is shown in figure 1. The consecutive
reformulation of the contradictions arouse by the problem occurs during the
solution of a problem in the framework of TRIZ. Each following contradiction
makes our understanding of the problem better.</p>

<p><b>Figure 1. Types of contradictions. Note, that usually difficulties of
contradiction resolution increase from the bottom to the top, and from the left
to the right side of the each line of this figure [5]</b></p>
<p>Let us discuss the first two groups of contradictions here, the last group -
the engineering contradictions - will be described in great details in <u>this
course</u> <font size="2" color="#FF0000">(hyperlink no longer available)</font>
later on.</p>
<p>We divided the natural contradictions into two groups.</p>
<p><u>Fundamental </u>contradictions show that natural laws limit possible
solution of the problem. <i>The impossibility to have temperature below 0 degree
K or speed above the light velocity are the examples of fundamental
contradictions. </i>Perhaps, such contradictions represent only our current
knowledge and some of them can be eliminated in the future.</p>
<p><u>Cosmological</u> contradictions represent restrictions caused by Earth
conditions. <i>For example, it is impossible to keep any weight at thin beam
because of the gravity at our planet, or a car cannot exhaust pure hydrogen
because of explosive interaction with oxygen in our atmosphere.</i><br>
</p>
<p>If a natural contradiction is not possible to overcome (at least currently
for the cosmological contradictions), we can rather speak about constraints and
trade-off solutions of the problem.</p>
<p>It seems useful to divide the social contradictions into three groups (see
the figure 1 above) according to the major restraints to innovation at different
society levels (see the table 1 below).<br>
</p>
<p><b>Table 1 Major Restraints to Innovation</b></p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#000000">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><center>
        <p><b>Individual</b></p>

    <tr>
      <td>Stereotyped thinking or/and lack of creativity (especially for elder
        specialists) or/and the psychological inertia</td>
      <td>Beliefs in some official functional method (often called a scientific)</td>
      <td>The &quot;holiness&quot; of the current political/economic system</td>
    </tr>

      <td>Time-handling schedules</td>
      <td>Bias against diagnosis of frontiers of the current paradigm</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>There is a simple hierarchy between different levels of the social
contradictions, and it is easy to break Individual or Managerial restraints than
Cultural ones.</p>
<p>The knowledge of the society level to which such contradiction belongs and
types of restraints helps choose the strategy for the problem's solution.</p>
<p>It is necessary to note that studies of social contradictions in TRIZ
intersect with psychology, management and other social disciplines but,
unfortunately, often the researchers don't know results of studies in other
fields.<br>
</p>
<p>At the first glance the administrative contradictions (as they were defined
by G. S. Altshuller) should be included in the social contradictions, but more
detailed analysis shows that the administrative contradictions can be often
located between the social and engineering contradictions at the figure 1.<br>
</p>
<p>It seems possible to resolve the Managerial - Organizational contradictions
in the framework of TRIZ methodology and such research is the outgoing activity
of some TRIZ experts. Often cultural and individual contradictions can be
presented as the problem's constrains. On the other hand, the human problems
often do not have a contradiction. There are two opposite ways for solving
routine problems without contradictions:<br>

  </tbody>

<p>Contrary to the solutions of the natural and engineering contradictions,
&quot;trade-offs&quot; compromise solutions in the human problems can frequently
provide good resolutions. Perhaps, this difference is based on various types of
systems: the technical systems usually have determined nature while nature of
the human systems is probable or stochastic.<br>
We will discuss how to find the solutions for various contradictions in the
following lessons.<br>
</p>
<p><br>
<b>3 Structure of a Problem</b><br>
</p>
<p>Because of diversity of various technical systems (TS) and technological
processes (TP), variety of problems can occur in technique. Some relations
between useful, neutral and harmful functions (see the Lesson 3 about<b> </b>UF,
NF and HF) exist inherently in any TS or TP. On the other hand, any TS or TP can
be presented as a set of subsystems. Initially the structures of technical
systems or technological processes say almost nothing about the problem solving
and requirements for the solution. They simply describe the status quo of a
technique. When conflicts between the functions appear in a technique they can
be presented in the structures of problems that reflect type of relations
between UF, NF and HF and structure of technique. In order to present such
conflicts through the technical or physical contradictions we will consider only
UF and HF in this section.<b> </b>Representation of contradictions together with
the hierarchical structure of technique allows one to figure out a topology
(structure) of a problem.</p>
<p>It is possible to figure out a few generic problems' structures [5]:<br>
</p>
<p><b>Point </b>problems have the physical or natural contradictions inside a
single subsystem or NO contradictions at all. Point problems with the physical
contradiction are usually hidden, but they are often the root cause of all other
problems. A point problem usually appears after reduction of semantic links of
more complicated problems structures or due to careful analysis of problems set
in a technique.</p>
<p>In non-contradiction case the point problems are required to produce
practically unconstrained different ideas, so creative methods of idea
generation such as brainstorming, synectics, lateral thinking, etc. are quite
useful for this as well as for social contradictions.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Pair </b>problems have the single technical contradiction between
functions in two subsystems. They usually appear after reduction of inventive
situation or more complicated structures to a set of independent technical
contradictions.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Linear </b>problems have chains of engineering contradictions. They
usually can be presented as a sequence of dependent technical and physical
contradictions in two or more different subsystems.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Network </b>problems have a loop of several dependent contradictions
(often so-called mathematical). They appear when <b>l, m, </b>and <b>n</b>
subsystems depend on each other and/or can be dependent on <b>k </b>subsystem,
hence we have several technical and/or physical contradictions that are linked.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Triangle </b>problems have three dependent engineering contradictions. A
triangle<b> </b>problem is the simplest case of a <b>network</b> problem.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Star </b>problems have sets of independent technical or mathematical
contradictions with the common root (that is usually a physical contradiction).
They usually appear when one characteristic (or subsystem)<b> k</b> of a system
gets better, but other <b>l, m, n, …</b> get worse. If contradictions A with
B, C and D are independent, the s<b>tar </b>problems can be reduced to the <b>pair
</b>problems. Note that a star problem often has a hidden physical contradiction
in the root, hence can be reduced to a <b>point </b>problem.</p>
<p><br>
Beyond such generic (primitive) structures, some more complex and even puzzle
structures exist, such as the hierarchical (that reflect usually the structure
of TS and TP), etc. Such problems cannot be solved &quot;as is&quot; and should
be reduced to one or a few generic structures. In the framework of TRIZ, in
order to convert a complex structure of problem (e.g., non-single triangle or
hierarchical) into a simple generic problem's structure (e.g., point or pair or
triangle), it is essential to reformulate the problem in terms of distinguish
subsystems, functions (primary, secondary, etc. /see the previous lesson/) and
resources /will be discussed in the following lesson/; it is imperative to
crystallize a contradiction in the problem; and it is important to
systematically collect, organize and document all important information related
to the situation.<br>
</p>
<p>For simplicity problems in technical systems are discussed here, although the
proposed ideas are also correct for the technological processes as well. The
different structures of problems can be presented using the following
questionnaire [4] as the guide to semantics of the problems:</p>

<p>It is important to recognize the problem's structure because different TRIZ
problem solving heuristics work better or worse for different problems.
Clarification of a structure of a problem should also provide the easiest way to
operate with the knowledge databases of TRIZ. The understanding of the problem's
structure gives a strategy and helps choose appropriate information needed for
solving the inventive problems. It seems rational to label the so-called <b>physical</b>
contradictions by <b>ANDNOT logical operator</b> and present the so-called <b>technical</b>
contradiction through <b>XOR logical operator</b> [5]<b>. </b>Usually the simple
logical operators <b>AND</b> together with <b>OR</b> are used only for
representations of TS or TP. &quot;New&quot; (ANDNOT and XOR) and traditional
operators can be used for graphs of problems in terms of contradictions and
subsystems and functions of a technique that help resolve the technical
problems. It gives a strategy for solving the problem and helps choose
appropriate information needed to solve the problem.<br>

<p><b>4 Conclusion</b><br>

<p>In contrast with other methods of solving the technical problems, TRIZ
emphasizes the contradictions and recommends resolve them instead of usual
engineering trade-offs. Such approach allows to receive strong inventive
solutions. The full set of contradictions known in TRIZ was reviewed in this
Lesson. The schematic presentation of the technique and problems in it under
consideration allows to reduce numerous different objects to few generic cases.
It allows one to find solutions of the problems by analogy with already solved
problems with similar structures more easily than in the framework of the other
approaches to problem solving [1-4].</p>
<p>TRIZ actively uses models of the problem that describe the native
contradictions in some primary functions of a technique. In this course we will
consider mostly point and pair technical problems, which have the so-called
physical and technical contradictions correspondingly. Several heuristics have
been implemented by G. S. Altshuller and The TRIZ&nbsp;Experts for resolution of
the point and pair contradictions. These heuristics will be considered in great
details in the lessons of this course. The triangle problems became recently one
of targets in TRIZ researches. A heuristic method for triangle and network
problems rupture has been developed by the author but it is out of the scope of
our present studies (see <font color="#0000FF">The Advanced TRIZ Course </font><font size="2" color="#FF0000">[hyperlink
unavailable at this time]</font>). It is unknown usually in advance how to
eliminate this contradiction in reality, but there is always the possibility of
formulating an imaginary solution named in TRIZ as the Ideal Final Result that
will be discussed next .<br>
