<p align="left"><b>Introduction</p>
</b>
<p>Interest in the possible applicability of TRIZ tools and techniques to the
world of management and organisational innovation issues continues to grow. The
aim of this article is to place the 40 Inventive Principles of TRIZ in the
context of this business environment. The format of the article is based closely
on an earlier text (1) in which examples of technical deployment of the
Principles were given.</p>
<p>The 40 Inventive Principles provide innovators with systematic and potent
means of breaking out of current paradigms into often exciting and beneficial
new ones (2). The article will attempt to demonstrate that the same
psychological inertia busting benefits may also accrue when the Principles are
applied in a business rather than a purely engineering context.</p>
<p>Set in a business context, the 40 Inventive Principles exhibit a number of
similarities and differences relative to their use in technical problem solving
applications. Probably the biggest difference is that, as yet at least, there is
no ‘business’ version of the Contradiction Matrix to help filter the number
of Principles which may be applicable in a given specific circumstance. The
biggest similarity is that ‘serious’ TRIZ is hard work and this version of
the 40 Principles, therefore, exists merely to stimulate creative thinking about
business situations and is not meant to eliminate the need for detailed,
in-depth analysis of a particular inventive situation.</p>
<p>To use these 40 Inventive Principles, formulate your problem using the same
methods used for TRIZ for technical problems. It will be particularly helpful to
formulate the ideal final result and the reasons that the ideal cannot be
achieved. This will usually lead to contradictions. For example, in a customer
service situation, the ideal final result is &quot;The customer gets exactly
what she needs exactly when she needs it.&quot; The analysis might follow this
path:</p>
<blockquote>
  <i>
  <p>&quot;But, I can't give it to her because my employees don't have all the
  knowledge.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Why not?&quot;<br>
  &quot;Because employee turnover is so fast that un-trained employees are
  used.&quot;</p>
  </i>
  <p>This analysis reveals several potential problems and families of solutions:<br>
  The customer gets what she needs without (direct) help of employees.<br>
  The employees have the knowledge without training<br>
  The trained employees don't leave the job.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now use the 40 principles to look for solutions to each of these categories
of problems, then select the one (or more) that has the highest probability of
working in this situation. When applying the 40 inventive principles keep in
mind the TRIZ concepts of removing the reason for the contradiction, and using
the available resources.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to use the principles in random order (don't read the list
from 1 to 40 each time!) to keep your thinking independent.</p>

</p><ul>
  <li>(Proportionately) more ‘P’ or more ‘S’ in the Deming PDSA cycle</li>
  <li>Skewed normal distributions.</li>
  <li>Use a different marketing approach for each class of clients. (Combine
    with Segmentation and Local Quality--make each class smaller to be sure the
    approach is exactly tailored to it.)</li>
  <li>Budget for different departments individually rather than using a constant
    percentage increase or reduction for all departments</li>

    Together Teams)</li>

<b>
<p>Principle 8. Anti-Weight</p>
</b>
<p>A. <i>To compensate for the weight <font color="#008000">(downward tendency)</font>
of an object, merge it with other objects that provide lift.</i></p>
</p><ul>
  <li>In a merger of two companies, one ‘lifts’ the other with whatever its
    stronger features are (distribution system, marketing, methods, capital,
    etc)</li>
  <li>Companies increase flagging sales by making connections with other rising
    products (e.g. movie tie-ins)</li>
  <li>‘This is my depressed stance. When you're depressed, it makes a lot of
    difference how you stand. The worst thing you can do is straighten up and
    hold your head high because then you'll start to feel better. If you're
    going to get any joy out of being depressed, you've got to stand like this.’
    Charlie Brown</li>
  <li>&quot;Whenever I feel afraid, I hold my head erect, and whistle a happy
    tune, and no one will suspect I'm afraid.&quot;--Anna in &quot;The King and
    I&quot; by Rogers and Hammerstein</li>
</ul>
<p>B. <i>To compensate for the weight <font color="#008000">(downward tendency)</font>
of an object, make it interact with the environment (e.g. use <font color="#008000">global
lift forces</font>).</i></p>
</p><ul>
  <li>A small company is ‘lifted’ by a resource - use of a transportation
    network, etc - to the level of the larger companies</li>
  <li>Political parties boost poll ratings by attaching themselves to popular
    causes</li>
  <li>Attach product/service marketing to customer and business driving forces (Megatrends
    - aging population, desire for flexibility, simplicity, etc)</li>
</ul>
<b>
<p>Principle 9. Preliminary Anti-Action</p>
</b>
<p>A. <i>If it will be necessary to do an action with both harmful and useful
effects, this action should be replaced with anti-actions to control harmful
effects</i>.</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>When making a public announcement, include all the information, not just
    the harmful parts (e.g. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s handling of the Tylenol
    tampering case)</li>
  <li>Use formal risk assessment methods to quantify risk and identify
    mitigation actions before (and during) a project</li>
  <li>Customer trials/segmented launch of (high risk) new products (e.g. film
    companies film several endings to a movie and trial with different audiences
    before finalising selection)</li>
  <li>Use of voluntary redundancy/pay-cuts/short-time working/job-sharing as
    alternatives to down-sizing</li>
</ul>
<p>B. <i>Create beforehand stresses in an object that will oppose known
undesirable working stresses later on</i>.</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Epson product development engineers spend time as sales and then service
    staff before they are allowed to work on product development activities
    (Reference 3, p101)</li>
  <li>Prior to a lay-off, prepare compensation, outplacement, and communication
    packages for all affected employees</li>

  <li>Perform non-critical path tasks early (where circumstances permit)</li>
  <li>Dialogue with employees before embarking on BPR/change management

</ul>
<b>

reliability of an object</i>.</p>

</ul>
<b>
<p>Principle 12. Equipotentiality</p>

conditions to eliminate the need to raise or lower objects in a gravity field).</i></p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Make ‘horizontal’ career changes to broaden skills</li>
  <li>Team members distribute their own merit award money (rather than often

    level of incompetence (15)</li>
</ul>
<b>
<p>Principle 13. 'The Other Way Round'</p>
</b>
<p>A. <i>Invert the action(s) used to solve the problem (e.g. instead of cooling
an object, heat it).</i></p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Bring the mountain to Mohammed, instead of bringing Mohammed to the
    mountain.</li>

<p>C. <i>Turn the object (or process) 'upside down</i>'.</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Cash-till assistant is the most important part of a retail organisation</li>
  <li>Computer help lines were often originally set up with relatively
    no-technical staff at the front-end, directing calls to progressively more
    technically able staff the more complicated the problem is. Latest logic
    suggests reversing this trend - i.e. place the most qualified staff as first
    point of contact (e.g. IBM)</li>

(parallelepiped) to ball-shaped structures.</p>

    - a customer at a participating store chooses which fabric he/she wants,
    then is measured. Those measurements are transmitted instantly to a Levi's
    plant in Tennessee where the data controls a laser cutter. The bar-coded
    pieces are stitched on the regular assembly line, and mailed directly to the
    customer. (The custom Levi’s, which customers love, run about $15 more

<p>A Final Thought</p>
</b>
<p>Although not claiming the search of management texts for this article was in
any way comprehensive, it was, nevertheless, very broad-ranging. It is worth
noting that in all the texts we examined, we did not discover any ideas or
innovations which caused us to believe there might be a 41<sup>st Inventive
(Business) Principle.</sup></p>
