<p>Abstract</p>
</i></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This article shows how some of the Theory of
Constraints (TOC) logical trees, namely the Current Reality Tree (CRT) and the
Conflict Resolution Diagram (CRD) can be useful for graphically describing the
inventive situation and identifying / selecting the core problem to be tackled
via ARIZ or other TRIZ methods, as well as to more easily identify the
contradictions involved in the problem.</font></p>
<b><i>
<p>Prelude</p>
</i></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">By this article I humbly request entrance to the
TRIZ authors community. That’s because I don’t consider myself a TRIZ
wiseman, given my experience of just three years with such a powerful and
complex methodology. Incidentally, before going into the main subject of
discussion, I’d like to share with the readers some frustration I had during
my first steps on the TRIZ road. By attending to TRIZ symposia in the USA and
listening to some long-time travelers along that road (famous consultants), I
always left with the somewhat exaggerated perception that one should not dare to
use TRIZ without a 20-year experienced black belt by his side (preferably the
one who was giving the lecture). But soon I was glad to read in a book from the
TRIZ Master of Masters: “I want to emphasize that anyone can become a
professional - you just have to learn the subject matter. That’s it. ...
Talent is 99% hardwork. ... First, you have to become a professional. Anyone can
accomplish that. Then, we will see.... This book is enough for you to start”
[1]. So after a relatively short period of TRIZ study and “incubation” (this
actually never ends...) I started to use it and had the rewarding surprise that
much can be accomplished in the creativity arena with just a little TRIZ basics.
That is not to say that TRIZ is trivial (much on the contrary) nor that there is
no benefit in hiring a consultant (which I am too, by the way). The point is
that TRIZ is so powerful that once you study and add a pinch of it to your
technical knowledge and engineering common sense, you’re on the way to
becoming a more creative professional. And, along the road, you will probably
want to call that consultant for help, so we’ll all be happy. But that should
not preclude you from self-studying and self-learning TRIZ.</font></p>

<p>Introduction</p>
</i></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Working with teams in the application of ARIZ
for problem solving and concept generation, I usually had no difficulty in
finding a problem to attack, or even finding a contradiction. There are plenty
of them out there. But an uncomfortable feeling was always there in the
background, as this question pounded my mind: “How do you know this is <u>the</u>
problem? How do you know this is the <u>right</u> contradiction to solve?”.
That was when I started to consider tools that could shed light onto the task of
describing the inventive situation, so that the core inventive problem and
corresponding contradiction(s) are selected. In this sense, I found very useful
to borrow some tools from the Theory of Constraints (TOC), namely the Current
Reality Tree (CRT) and Conflict Resolution Diagram (CRD).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The above mentioned difficulty of correct
problem identification is acknowledged in the article by Zlotin and Zusman, <i>ARIZ
on the Move </i>[2]: “The most serious problem took place, however, when
students were trying to solve real life (and thus poorly formulated) problems,
due to the absence of ‘problem clarification and formulation’ steps in
ARIZ-85C. This section existed in previous modifications of ARIZ (ARIZ-71, 77)
but was excluded in later versions due to the lack of improvement it had
undergone compared to other, more rigorous and quickly evolving sections of ARIZ”.
Later in this same paper, the authors state that a poorly formulated problem
contributes to make the solution process extremely difficult and that the
transition from the initial problem statement to a correctly defined
mini-problem is a challenge, even for experienced TRIZ specialists. Therefore,
tools that can help identify the core problem and corresponding conflicts are
very welcome to TRIZ. These are exactly the first steps in the Goldratt’s TOC
Thinking Process (for more on the subject of TOC, I recommend reference [3]).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Earlier in 1997, Rizzo [4] briefly comments
about the synergy between TRIZ and TOC tools, with more emphasis on the use of
the CRD to identify contradictions, but no examples are given. Later, Domb and
Kowalick [5] quickly stated ‘en passant’ that TOC could help TRIZ in the
problem identification steps. More recently, Domb and Dettmer [6] suggested that
TRIZ can help TOC and vice-versa, but again more emphasis is given to the use of
the CRD. The following sections add evidence to those observations, by giving
examples on how the use of CRT and CRD could help the application of TRIZ to
some real life problems in the automotive industry. However, no explanations are
given here about how to build a CRT or a CRD. For that purpose, the refer is
again referred to Dettmer’s book [3]. In the following examples the author
apologizes for eventual problems in the translation of technical terms from
Portuguese into English. Please also note that emphasis is given only to the
usefulness of the TOC trees, instead of going into details about the complete
case studies nor about the final solutions (both for the sake of conciseness and
for protection of patentable ideas).</font></p>

<p>How to read the logical trees</p>
</i></b>
<p><img border="0" src="5-1.gif" width="454" height="229"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="5-2.jpg" width="367" height="236"></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Before we jump into the examples, a short
explanation about how to read a CRT and a CRD. A CRT is made up of two types of
elements: “entities” and logical symbols, connected by arrows. Entities are
single-idea, clear statements about the current reality, enclosed in a text box.
Consider a plastic encapsulated microcircuit with 300 external leads (external
conductors) separated by a fraction of a millimeter. The following are examples
of entities: “there is voltage between leads”; “ambient air is moist”;
“parasitic current flows between leads”; “ionic contaminant is left on
device surface”. The ellipse is one of the logical symbols, and works like an
AND logical gate. By joining those elements following certain logical rules one
may get a better understanding of the current reality, as shown in the right
branch of beside figure , which is read like this: IF “there is voltage
between leads” AND “ambient air is moist” AND “ionic contaminant is left
in device surface” THEN “parasitic current flows between leads” (effect).
If a single cause (or an additional set of causes going through another ellipse)
can give the same effect, there will be another arrow path going to the effect
entity . In this case, we link the logical statements with the OR clause. Thus,
the complete reading of that figure would be: IF “there is voltage between
leads” AND “ambient air is moist” AND “ionic contaminant is left in
device surface” OR IF “metallic micro-particles are left on device surface”
AND “there is voltage between leads” THEN “parasitic current flows between
leads”.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">A CRD has a fixed structure and is formed by one
common objective, two requirements and two conflicting prerequisites, as shown
in the figure to the left, which is read: On one hand, in order to reach “common
objective” we must have “requisite 1”. In order to reach “requisite 1”
we must have “prerequisite 1”. On the other hand, to reach “common
objective” we must have “requisite 2”. In order to reach “requisite 2”
we must have the conflicting “prerequisite 2”. And those conflicting
prerequisites usually are the hidden reason why the common objective is not
attained.</font></p>
<b><i>
<p>Air conditioning odor</p>
</i></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Under certain climatic conditions, fungi and
bacteria grow inside the dark and moist environment in the evaporator comb of an
automotive air conditioning system. That gives rise to a most annoying odor when
starting up system’s ventilation, after a shut down period. A team decided to
apply TRIZ in order to generate conceptual solutions to the problem. They first
built a functional tree, shown in Figure 1.</font></p>
<p><img border="1" src="5-3.jpg" width="630" height="375"></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">That diagram was very useful to highlight the
involved functions and harmful effects, but it does not show the dynamics of the
problem, that is, the sequential combination of events which culminate in the
final effect of bad start up odor. Thus, the team decided to build the CRT of
Figure 2 (following page). The tree clearly showed the root causes behind the
odor effect:</font></p>
</p><ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Filter lets microorganisms and particles
    (pollen, etc.) get into the system.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Current design allows water retention inside
    the evaporator.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the initial problem “we want to eliminate
bad start up odor” could be more precisely restated as the following
mini-problems, which pinpointed two main directions for solution, either of
which could eliminate the odor effect:</font></p>
</p><ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">“We want to eliminate water retention in
    the evaporator” (e.g.: dry evaporator after use, change design etc.).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">“We want to eliminate intrusion of
    particles and / or microorganisms into the system” (e.g.: improve filter
    efficiency, kill microorganisms before they get inside etc.).</font></li>
</ul>

<p>Rear spring noise</p>
</i></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The blades of a truck’s rear spring set are
separated by a plastic disc intended to eliminate the squeak noise due to
friction between the blades. However, the plastic disc quickly wears out and
noise begins. Again, the CRT in Figure 3 was useful to complement the
understanding provided by a previously built functional diagram. The CRT
pinpointed the basic problems that were giving rise to the final noise effect
(which was not apparent in the functional diagram).</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="1" src="5-5.jpg" width="435" height="473"></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Out of the nine final concept solutions
generated in this case after applying ARIZ, two good ones immediately popped up
just by looking at the root cause “plastic disc is fixed to the secondary
blade”, disclosed by the CRT. The solutions offered were:</font></p>
</p><ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">“Rubber sandwich” (elimination of surface
    friction by use of a thick, flexible rubber disc fixed to both blades).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">“Split disc” (change from heterogeneous
    metal-plastic friction to homogeneous plastic-plastic friction by splitting
    disc in two halves and fixing both of them to the blades).</font></li>
</ul>

<p>Air exhaust valve</p>
</i></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to avoid discomfort or safety problems
to the passengers, a car must have an air exhaust valve that relieves the
internal air pressure generated when the ventilation system is on or, in a more
critical situation, when an air bag is inflated. A certain car’s exhaust valve
was properly and safely accomplishing its “relieve air pressure” function,
but another harmful effect was present: “dust gets into the car”. The valve
consists of a box fixed to a opening in the car body. Inside the box are six
little plastic molded doors, inclined with respect to the vertical plane, which
close by their own weight and open under a certain air pressure level built
inside the car. In this case, the functional diagram of Figure 4 clearly showed
that the core problem was the harmful function: “mechanical oscillations from
car displacement shake and open valve doors, which then make rattle noise and
let dust get in”, so it was not necessary to build a CRT.</font></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="2"></font>
<p align="center"><img border="1" src="5-6.jpg" width="630" height="362"><br>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p align="center"><img border="1" src="5-7.jpg" width="511" height="383"><br>
<b><i>Figure 5</i></b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">From that clear problem statement we decided to
use a CRD in order to identify a technical conflict or, preferably, a physical
contradiction behind the situation. Starting from the ideal final result “valve
relieves any excess internal air pressure <u>and</u> does not let any dust get
inside” as the CRD’s objective (Figure 5), we worked down to two conflicting
prerequisites, thus highlighting the physical contradictions (“door must be <i>easy</i>
<i>to open </i><u>and</u> door must be <i>hard</i> <i>to open</i>”; “door
must be <i>light</i> <u>and</u> <i>heavy</i>”) which opened a nice path to an
extremely simple, cheap and very effective solution. Incidentally, the author
believes that this case was the very first industrial application of TRIZ in
Brazil.</font></p>

<p>Damaged fuel level meter</p>
</i></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">An automotive fuel level meter was being damaged
during installation and maintenance operations due to mechanical stresses
imparted to the relatively thin and long metal lever that transmits movement
from the buoy to the electric cursor inside the meter. Two CRDs disclosed the
contradictions shown in Figure 6, which then quickly led to an amazingly simple
and cost effective idea that significantly increased the mechanical strength and
solved the problem.</font></p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
</i></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Real life examples were given which show that
the stand-alone or combined use of two logical trees from the Theory of
Constraints’ Thinking Process, namely the CRT (Current Reality Tree) and the
CRD (Conflict Resolution Diagram) can be very helpful to, respectively,
correctly formulate the mini-problem and reveal the basic technical / physical
contradictions.</font></p>
