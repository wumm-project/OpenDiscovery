<p align="JUSTIFY">Introduction</p>
</font>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Conventional Concept Development in Innovation</p>
</b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">Reducing time to market has become imperative in competition,
and the technology to generate breakthrough concepts and ideas has become the
real key to success. Engineers recognize the difficulty of the task by failure
to further improve a product significantly. Instead, any attempts to improve one
parameter of the product leads to deterioration of another parameter. Having
limited time, no guide to solve problems in innovation, and, as a result,
failing to develop breakthrough solutions, they select trade-off solutions,
fearing that a competitor could have a better result. In addition, project teams
are not sure that all problems that are worth solving are revealed and
considered.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Today to be successful in product development, there is a
need to develop an exhaustive set of concepts comprising all possible
developments of the product. This need requires the formulation of all
product-related problems worth solving and the successful solving of those
problems.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving</p>
</b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">All problems in innovation are unique, so it is not obvious
that a step-by-step guide could be used to solve all of them. Common thinking
accepts recommendations such as “be creative,” “generate as many ideas as
possible,” “think about your problem all the time,” “hire ‘out-of-the-box’
thinkers,” etc.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Recognizing generic types of problems in innovation was the
key to developing the <b><i>Theory of Inventive Problem Solving</i>.</b> TRIZ
(the Russian acronym for the theory) is the knowledge-based, systematic approach
to innovation. Developed in the former Soviet Union by Genrich S. Altshuller
(1926-1998) and his school, TRIZ methods are drawn from analysis of the most
innovative inventions in different industries, technologies, and fields of
engineering.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The power of TRIZ is based on utilizing trends </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">in</font><font face="Times New Roman">
the evolution of successful products, ways to overcome psychological barriers,
and generalization of the ways used to solve problems in the most innovative
inventions.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">TRIZ involves a systematic analysis of the system to be
improved and the application of a series of guidelines for problem definition.
TRIZ classifies innovative problems and offers corresponding problem-solving
methods for each class of problem.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">TRIZ analysis of the system to be improved includes an
integrated system approach, function analysis, and function modeling. In problem
formulation and problem solving, TRIZ aims to maximize utilization of the
resources of the product or process, its supersystem, and its environment.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Since Altshuller stopped development of TRIZ, his followers
have continued its development. Extensive practice had dictated the need for
improving the effectiveness of revealing problems to solve, integration of TRIZ
methods, and their further development.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Function Analysis</p>
<i><font face="Times New Roman"></font></i></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">Altshuller understood the importance of a function approach
in problem solving since the earliest days of TRIZ. For example, his concept of
the Ideal System says that the Ideal System performs its function but does not
exist, which means that the Ideal System performs its function for free and with
no harm. However, the need for integration of Function Analysis into TRIZ was
recognized after developing methods to solve generic problems in innovation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Function analysis plays the key role in problem formulation.
This paper describes an advanced development called TOP Function Analysis and
its advantages.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Substance-Field Analysis</p>
</b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">Altshuller developed a method and a set of symbols for
describing generic types of problems and their solutions. The method was called
Substance-Field Analysis (SFA).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Altshuller’s model of the simplest useful system is
composed <b>of three elements - the two substances and the field.</b></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Althsuller’s Substance-Field Analysis enables you to
describe models of systems to be improved and models of improved systems. A set
of 76 most effective generic transitions of models toward models of improved
systems he called Standard Solutions to Inventive Problems.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Substance-Field Models describe models of the systems rather
than functions. However, in order to support Function Analysis, you need to
describe models of the functions.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Tool-Object-Product (TOP) Function Analysis</p>
<i><font face="Times New Roman"></font></i></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">Tool-Object-Product (TOP) Analysis, the next generation of
Substance-Field Analysis, was developed by Zinovy Royzen in 1989. The simplest
useful function has four components. It has the tool of the function (or the
function provider), the object of the function (or recipient of the action of
the tool), the action of the tool at the object, and one more component - the
product of the function. The useful function of the tool is to obtain the
product of the function from the object. The action is described by one arrow,
which simplifies the model.</p>
<b><i>

Figure 5. Model of a harmful function</p>
</font></i></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p>Very often a useful action also causes an unwanted effect, or an attempt to
improve a function leads to deterioration in another function of the system.
Conflicts are the most difficult type of problem in innovation. TRIZ offers
models to describe any type of conflict.</p>

Figure 6. Model of a conflict</p>
</i></b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Modeling a function by describing all four components - the
tool, the object, the action, and the product - improves understanding of both
the function and the best ways for its improvement.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The following subsections describe some of the advantages of
TOP Function Modeling:</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Generic Model of a Function</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Neither the tool of the function nor the object of the
function has to be a substance. TOP Function Modeling allows you to model any
function in any system. It is a more generic way to model a function than
Substance-Field Modeling.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Precise Description of a Function</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Desired and unwanted products of the functions of a modeled
system improve understanding of the system and simplify analysis of the system
resources.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Link Between Functions</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Introducing the product of a function into its model provides
a very convenient and understandable link between functions. For example, a
product of the first function can be a tool or an object of a subsequent
function.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The link between functions is important in understanding not
only a desired performance of a product, but also the chain of unwanted
functions. Links between functions simplify cause-effect analysis and improve
the process of revealing the cause of a current or potential failure of a
product.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Increasing Effectiveness of Function Analysis</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Function analysis guides you in decomposing the performance
of your product into single functions - both useful and unwanted. The system
approach guides you in describing the function of the supersystem of your
product and interactions between the product and its supersystem. It also guides
you in analyzing and describing interactions between the product and its
surroundings that are not part of the supersystem. Then a single function can be
considered separately if it needs improvement.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">TRIZ offers five basic function models:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Adequate useful function (may require technological
    forecast)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Insufficient useful function (requires improvement)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Absent useful function (requires introduction)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Harmful or undesired function (requires elimination)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Unknown undesired function (requires revealing the cause)</li>
</ol>
<i></i>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Function modeling helps you to understand the system’s
performance, state the set of problems to consider, rank priority of the stated
problems, classify the problems, and determine the TRIZ Methods to be applied
according to the following TRIZ Flow Chart.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A Key to Advanced Development of Problem Solving Methods</p>
</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">TOP Function Modeling has allowed further development of
problem solving methods and their integration:</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Ideal Ways</b> is an analytical method made up of the ideal
directions for improving a function. Ideal Way 1, for example, guides you in
stating problems related to the possibility of elimination of the function and
its tool. The TOP model of the analyzed useful function provides the possible
ways - eliminating the need for the product of the function or eliminating the
object of the function.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">TRIZ Conflict Solving Methods</b> include TRIZ Standard
Techniques, ARIZ, and Inventive Principles.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">TRIZ Standard Techniques is a further improvement of Standard
Solutions, developed by Zinovy Royzen. Standard Techniques<i> </i>are
step-by-step guides for applying generic solutions to your problem and
developing specific solutions by utilizing the resources of the system, its
supersystem, and its environment.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">TRIZ Standard Techniques include:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Six techniques</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> </font><font face="Times New Roman">for
  direct elimination</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> </font><font face="Times New Roman">of
  a harmful</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> </font><font face="Times New Roman">or
  unwanted function (Direct Ways)</li>
  <li>Seven techniques for indirect elimination of a harmful or unwanted
    function</li>
  <li>Three techniques for elimination of the consequences of a harmful function</li>
  <li>Three techniques for converting a harmful action into a useful function</li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">(Direct Ways provides a set of generic techniques for
preventing an unwanted function from producing its unwanted product. Indirect
Ways is a set of generic techniques for eliminating harm form an unwanted
product.)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">These techniques guide you to consider a complete set of the
best approaches to dealing with a situation where an unwanted function is
involved. This set of best generic approaches leads to an exhaustive set of
concepts. The ideality of solutions depends on the availability of resources and
the current constrains, which change over time.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Further development of ARIZ and its integration into the
process of concept development.</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Integration of ARIZ and initial function analysis of a system
has improved conflict definition and eliminated repetition. TOP modeling
improves understanding of the conflict, its opposite versions, the function of
X-resource and its product. One of the most difficult steps in ARIZ -
formulation of the physical contradiction - is simplified significantly.
Integration of TRIZ Methods allowed reducing the number of steps in ARIZ and
improving its effectiveness.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">A Hard Drive Problem</p>
</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">A hard drive has an actuator arm, which can move relative to
a magnetic disk that is rotated by an electric motor. At the end of the arm is a
read/write head, which can magnetize or sense the magnetic field of the disk.
The head is separated from the surface of the disk by airflow generated by the
rotating disk. The gap between the head and the disk is very small. Any contact
between the head and the magnetic disk may cause loss of data.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The disk has a landing zone, where the head is positioned
when the disk is not spinning. The landing zone is an area of the disk where no
data is stored. When the computer is switched on, the disk starts spinning,
creating an airflow, which lifts the arm, and creating the required gap. Then
the arm is moved away from the landing zone to read and write data. When the
computer is turned off, the arm is returned to the landing zone. Slowing of the
spinning disk decreases the airflow supporting the arm. As a result, the arm
rests on the landing zone.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Applying an external force to the drive (such as moving or
knocking the computer), can move the head away from the landing zone and destroy
data on the disk. A latching mechanism is used to prevent the arm from moving
when the computer is not in use. A permanent magnet holds the arm when the head
is in the landing zone. When the computer is turned on, the arm has to overcome
the latch magnet in order to move.</p>

<p>Problem</p>
</b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">The drive needs to be protected against stronger external
force. This could be achieved by replacing the current latch magnet with a
stronger one. But the arm would not be able to overcome the force of any magnet
stronger than the current one. Thus an attempt to improve the reliability of the
hard drive causes deterioration of its performance.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A breakthrough solution is needed to improve the reliability
of the drive without any deterioration of its performance, while minimizing any
increase in production costs.</p>
</font><b>
<p>Summary of Functional Analysis</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The latching mechanism includes the latch magnet, a plastic
holder for the latching magnet, and a screw. The function of the latch magnet is

the possibility of replacing the latch magnet. All resources have to be tried as
X.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">One possibility: The arm carries a voice coil. Interaction
between the magnetic field created by an electric current through the voice coil
and the magnetic field of the voice coil magnets swings the arm around the pin.
The latch magnet could be replaced by a much stronger voice coil magnet. In this
case, there would be no need for the latch magnet, its plastic holder, and the
screw. In mass production of the hard drives, the solution could save a lot of
money for the manufacturer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Another possibility: The external force itself could be used
to hold the arm instead of the latch magnet. The solution looks like a “safety
belt” for the arm.</p>

lead to analysis of a variety of locking mechanisms used in different
industries.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">An Oxidizer Turbopump Problem</p>
</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">An oxidizer turbopump is one of the most complex and
expensive components of a Space Shuttle Class Main Engine (SSCME). It feeds the
main combustion chamber with oxygen. The turbine of the oxidizer turbopump is
rotated by a high velocity flow of very high temperature oxygen, called GOX (gas
oxygen). The turbopump is made of material that resists working temperature
oxygen.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Failure of the oxidizer turbopump can be caused by a dust
particle or other wearing particle in the GOX. Colliding with the hardware, a
particle, having a very high velocity because of the flow of GOX, would increase
the temperature of the hardware in the proximity of the collision to a level
beyond which its material could not resist the oxygen.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Ignition of the hardware generates more heat and could result
in complete failure of the oxidizer turbopump and, as a result, the complete

  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Try to insulate the blade from the particle.</li>

    increased by colliding particles, but the temperature of the blade must not
    be increased to the point of resisting GOX.</li>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Application of Direct Ways to Problem 2 led to formulation of
the following approaches to solving the problem.</p>
</font><font face="Times New Roman">
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Try to insulate the heated blade from the GOX. A
    technology to plate the hardware of the oxidizer turbopump with ceramic is
    known. This technology was developed in Russia. It is a very expensive
    technology. In addition, the ceramic plating would increase the weight of
    the engine. Furthermore, if the ceramic is not strong enough, it could cause
    engine failure.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Try to modify the GOX. If GOX is replaced by hydrogen,
    for example, the possibility of burning the hardware will be eliminated
    completely. This technology is known as a Fuel-Rich Staged Combustion Cycle
    Engine System. It has another potential for failure if high-temperature
    hydrogen mixes with the pumped oxygen in the oxidizer turbopump.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Try to reduce the temperature of GOX. The technology
    reducing the temperature of GOX without any reduction of the power of the
    oxidizer turbopump is known as a Full-Flow Staged Combustion Cycle Engine
    System. The power of the turbopump depends on the velocity and mass of the
    driving flow. In the known technology, all oxygen that is not directed to
    the fuel turbopump preburner passes through the oxidizer turbopump. Increase
    of the mass of the driving flow reduces the required velocity, resulting in
    reduction in the temperature of GOX.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Try to modify the heated blade. Try to increase the
    resistance of the blade material to oxygen. This is a materials problem.
    Materials having high resistance to oxygen do not necessarily have strong
    mechanical strength. Increasing the resistance of the material to oxygen
    very often causes increase of the weight of the turbopump.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Try to cool the blade to the working temperature, at
    which it resists oxygen. This raises subsequent problems: how to cool the
    heated blade and how to keep the temperature of the cooled zone of the blade
    from falling below the working temperature (otherwise, the performance of
    the pump would be deteriorated). An obvious resource for cooling the blade
    is LOX. But using it as a coolant presents some constraints: it is difficult
    to maintain working temperature by cooling using LOX, and it is difficult to
    have LOX in the time and place of an accidental collision.</li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">TRIZ requires consideration of all resources, including GOX
and the blade itself. From analysis of the simplified schematic of the engine,
it is known that GOX is not pure oxygen. GOX includes 1-2% of water vapor as a
result of burning hydrogen. Water vapor is an excellent coolant. It is already
at the working temperature and ready to cool the blade down to the working
temperature. It was necessary to make calculations to determine how much water
vapor is required, but the concept does not require any changes in the hardware
of the engine.</p>
