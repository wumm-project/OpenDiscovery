<p>Introduction</p>
</b>
<p>This article discusses the Child Safety Stairgate conceived by John and Ann
Hirst of Team Innovation in Bath. The inspiration for the design came initially
from the traumatic personal experience of watching powerless as their son fell
from the top of a flight of stairs.</p>
<p>The fall started a search for a suitable product which would prevent a
recurrence. The search proved largely fruitless.</p>
<p>Current safety gate variants suffer from a number of common problems. First
and foremost is the way in which they are secured into position. On most
stairgates, the method of securing uses highly unsatisfactory friction-based
methods, and on designs where a positive fixture location is provided, the user
is expected to make unsightly drillings into an appropriate piece of wall.</p>
<p>Other problems, then relate to lack of adaptability of the designs; for
example ability to cope with different staircase widths, or the scenario, after
the child has learned to open the gate, where the inconvenience of a
path-blocking obstruction is no longer required, but a ‘tumble-stopper’
function - stopping children, from falling all the way down the staircase -
would be a valuable feature.</p>
<p>This brief article examines the Team Innovation Stairgate design from a TRIZ
perspective; looking at how the staircase safety problem was defined, how the
design makes use of existing resources, and how, in the case of the ‘tumble-stopper’,
the design successfully eliminates a physical contradiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Problem Definition</p>
</b>
<p>Effective problem definition provides the foundation upon which successful
designs are built. Effective problem definition means capturing the ‘right’
set of customer requirements and translating them into parameters useable by
designers.</p>
<p>While recognising that in many instances, customers don’t know what ‘right’
is until they’ve seen it, it would be fair to say that current stair-gate
designs have done little to explore what ‘right’ ought to mean.</p>
<p>Current stair-gate designs are based around a relatively small number of
functional requirements (FRs - see Reference 1, 2):-</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>provide an effective barrier to prevent babies from falling down stairs</li>
  <li>allow access to adults and old children</li>
  <li>ability to cope with different stair widths</li>
  <li>low unit cost</li>
  <li>(ease of attachment)</li>
  <li>(attractive appearance)</li>
</ul>
<p>Consistent with the trend identified in Reference 1, that designs generally
evolve to include greater numbers of customer benefits - and hence Functional
Requirements - over time, it may be expected that there is scope, relative the
above list, to improve the design of the stair-gate.</p>
<p>A potent aid to help with the comprehensive definition of functional
requirements is the TRIZ System Operator concept (Reference 3, 4, Figure 1). The
concept forces designers to view the system under consideration from the
perspective of a) it’s interactions with sub and super-systems, and, b) how it
might be affected by time - either implications from the past, or possible
implications governing future use.</p>

<p align="center"></font><b><font size="2">Figure 1: TRIZ ‘System Operator’
Problem Viewing Tool</p>
</font></b>
<p align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although traditionally used as a means of focusing the problem definition and
problem solution processes - see Reference 4 in particular - we see here that
the System Operator tool has been used in a somewhat different manner, in that
rather than being used to identify a single problem, it has been used as a
systematic means of identifying a whole cluster of problem definitions.</p>
<p>The multi problem identification concept was used in three specific instances
during the conception of the new stair-gate design:-</p>
<b>
<p>SUPER-SYSTEM-PAST</b> - before the stair-gate is fitted, current positive
attachment systems require the drilling of location holes into the walls on
either side of the stairway. A functional requirement for ‘ease of attachment’,
suggests that pre-drilling operations should be eliminated if possible.</p>
<b>
<p>SYSTEM-FUTURE</b> - in current designs, as soon as the infant being protected
by the stair-gate becomes suitably mobile, the gate is usually removed. This
despite the potential risk that youngsters will fall down stairs. Thinking about
possible uses for the stair-gate system beyond it’s traditional life
expectancy saw the emergence of the new ‘tumble-stopper’ function described
later.</p>
<b>
<p>SUPER-SYSTEM-FUTURE</b> - examination of this scenario saw the emergence of
the scene in which the stair-gate is dismantled and leaves behind an unsightly
mark on the wall where the fastening was positioned. This window saw the
emergence of a Function Requirement ‘ease of dis-attachment’.</p>
<p>The full list of Functional Requirements for the new stair-gate, therefore,
grew to look like:-</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>provide an effective barrier to prevent babies from falling down stairs</li>
  <li>allow access to adults and old children</li>
  <li>ability to cope with different stair widths</li>
  <li>low unit cost</li>
  <li>(ease of attachment)</li>
  <li>(attractive appearance)</li>
  <li>(ease of dis-attachment)</li>
  <li>(future use as ‘tumble-stopper’)</li>
</ul>
<b>
<p>Use Of Resources</p>
</b>
<p>With a finalised list of FRs, the new stair-gate design began to emerge.
Because low unit cost was recognised as a primary consideration, maximum use of
available resources was then going to be a key factor if the design was to be
commercially viable.</p>
<p>A schematic of the eventual prize winning design is illustrated in Figure 2.</p>

positive-location catch - not shown)</p>
</font>
<p>Important resource related issues arising during the design process, then,
included:-</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Ease of Attachment: With unsightly wall attachments and friction-based
    attachment solutions forbidden (non-positive attachment fails to adequately
    meet the ‘effective barrier’ FR), it was then important to identify
    other - essentially invisible - means of positively securing the stair-gate
    to the supporting super-system. The ‘existing resource’ in these
    circumstances are then the staircase and the stair-gate. The figure shows
    how the two are utilised together to provide a simple and effective securing
    method.</li>
  <font color="#000000">
  <li>Simultaneous provision of gate and ability to cater for different
    staircase widths. The non-hinged part of the gate is made telescopic in
    order to allow a range of staircase widths to be accommodated.
    (Incidentally, the telescopic construction idea mimics the very common ‘nested
    doll’ inventive solution to length-volume technical contradictions.)</li>
  </font>
  <li>Tumble-stopper. The tumble-stopper function is somewhat different to the
    stair-gate function. The resource minimisation task here was to ensure that
    the same basic set of components could be utilised in both applications.
    Figure 3 in the next section illustrates how this was achieved.</li>
</ol>
<b>
<p>‘Tumble-Stopper’ Physical Contradiction</p>
</b>
<p>Multi-functionality was one of the key functional requirements for the
stairgate stated during its conception and design phase.</p>
<p>In its role as a ‘tumble-stopper’, the Stairgate is required to solve a
physical contradiction. The contradiction may be expressed as a need for the
stairgate to both BLOCK the stairway (to prevent injury causing falls) AND to
NOT BLOCK the stairway (to allow ease of passage up or down the stairway).</p>
<p>Physical Contradictions are solved using one of three strategies:-</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Separation in Space or Time</li>
  <li>Satisfying the contradiction, or,</li>
  <li>Use of Alternative Ways - transition to sub-, super-, alternative, or
    inverse system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Likely as not, the tumble-stopper could have employed any of the three
methods.</p>
<p>Separation in time would have tended to imply use of some kind of moving
component to solve the contradiction. This is in fact the method used to solve
the problem when the gate is in ‘stair-gate’ mode - where anyone wishing to
pass through the gate has to open and close the hinged gate. For the ‘tumble-stopper’
mode, however, the functional desire is for a system which seeks to minimise
user intervention. In this case, ‘Separation in Space’ is often a more
attractive solution option.</p>
<p>Inventive Principles most amenable to solution of ‘Separation in Space’
contradictions are:-</p>
<div align="left">
  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;Segmentation </td>
      <td>&nbsp;Taking Out</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;Local Quality </td>
      <td>&nbsp;Asymmetry</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;Nested Doll </td>
      <td>&nbsp;Another Dimension</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;Intermediary </td>
      <td>&nbsp;Copying</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;Flexible Shells/Thin Films</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>And from these, ‘Segmentation’ and ‘Another Dimension’ were elegantly
combined to produce the tumble-stopper solution illustrated in Figure 2.</p>
