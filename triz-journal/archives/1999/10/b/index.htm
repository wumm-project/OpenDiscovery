<p>Introduction</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There are many different kinds of devices used to supply
braking force for stopping or slowing a bicycle. For convenience and economical
consideration, a caliper or cantilever brake assembly is the most common one
used for gripping of the bicycle rim in response to operator manipulation of the
brake lever. Such a brake assembly generally includes two moveable brake shoes
which are mounted on the bicycle frame in the opposite sides of the bicycle rim.
The brake shoe has a brake pad to supply friction force when the brake pad is
engaging the rim for braking the bicycle (as shown in Figure 1).</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It is obvious that wetting and/or polishing surface will have
a lower coefficient of friction and braking force. The caliper or cantilever
brake of the bicycle is mounted unprotected on the frame structure. It means
that the braking performance is easily affected by the weather condition. On the
other hand, water films and grits adhered to the rim surface causes much lower
coefficient of friction. Realistically, a bicycle is usually pre-designed to
ride preferably on either dry or wet road. Therefore, it is necessary to develop
a brake device which is suitable for all weather conditions, in the mean time,
provides safe riding, and keeps the convenience of use.</p>
<font size="2"></font>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In the past, engineers made more efforts to make a lot
experiments in order to select the suitable material for improving braking
performance, such as the reliability and stability, in all weather conditions.
Al-alloy rims with a given brake-pad material gives the lower coefficient of
friction in the dry and the higher coefficient in the wet [1]. This is the most
common approach in recently years. Unfortunately, the softer Al tends to be
machined out of the rim surface if a piece of grit gets under a brake pad.
Pieces of Al become embedded in the brake pad and oxidize to <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;
mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span></font>, and then the
rim is worn more rapidly and the dry coefficient of friction can fall to a
dangerously low level. The described problem is not a concern for a steel rim.
However, the conventional method used to improve the braking performance in all
weather conditions causes inconvenience of use and some harmful side effects. In
another words, it is difficult to overcome the technical contractions by the
traditional compromising approach. Therefore, TRIZ is needed to overcome the
system contradictions.</p>
<b>
<p>Formulating From System Conflicts</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In order to make a right formulation, it is necessary to
re-analyze the system conflicts and re-define the design requirements. The
requirement of discussed system is briefly defined as:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><i>The braking shoe is suitable in all weather conditions,
and the extra wearing of rim surface should be avoided. In additional, it is
necessary to meet the requirements described without major changes in the system
morphology.”</i></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The core problem for developing suitable bicycle brake shoes
in all weather conditions can be discussed from two different viewpoints. The
first one is a brake pad formed of a material suitable for use only in one of
the weather conditions, i.e. dry or wet, and then customer is advised to replace
and adjust the brake pad in different weather condition. Secondly, when the rim
surface is covered with a water film and dirt and grit from the machined rim, it
will have lower braking performance under either wet or dry conditions. It is
not possible to solve the problem before the core problem is found.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">However, the conventional method for solving problems having
conflicts are briefly stated as follows:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">By the method of replacing or adjusting the brake pad,
    the reliability of braking can be improved in either wet or dry condition.
    But, it will lose the convenience of use..</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Comprised among technical parameters, i.e. material
    properties of the pad and the rim, to improve the stability of braking under
    all of weather condition, and some harmful effects, i.e. grit, internally
    produced.</li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">By using the Altshuller’s TRIZ Contradiction Matrix
analysis and 40 principles, one does not need to make a compromise between
system contradictions. The statement involved the contradictions can be
re-stated as follows in the terms of the Altshuller’s Contradiction Matrix:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Attribute “Reliability” causes deterioration of the
    attribute “Convenience of use”.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Attribute “Stability of object” causes deterioration
    of the attribute “Harmful side effects”.</li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">From the result of Contradiction Matrix in the terms of “Reliability/Convenience
of use” technical contradiction, there are three principles suggested to solve
system conflict. The recommended principles are listed as follows:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">An inexpensive short-lived object instead of an expensive
    durable one (Principle 27)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Moving to a new dimension (Principle 17)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Composite materials. (Principle 40)</li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Using the same process as above, there are four principles
recommended in the Contradiction Matrix in the terms of “Stability of
object/Harmful side effects” technical contradiction. The recommended
principles to solve conflict are listed as follows:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Transformation of physical and chemical states of an
    object (Principle 35)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Mediator (Principle 24)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Flexible film or thin membranes (Principle 30)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Mechanical vibration (Principle 18)</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Conceptual Design Development</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Considering the system requirements, it is reasonable to try
a solution from principles “Composite Materials”, “Mediators” and both.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The principle “Composite Materials” suggests:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><i>“Replace a homogeneous material with a composite one”.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The principle “Mediators” suggests:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><i>“Use an intermediary object to transfer or carry out
    an action”</i></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><i>“Temporarily connect an object to another one that
    is easy to remove”.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A partitioned brake pad is one of the concepts that generated
from the principle “Composite Materials”, and it is a useful way to overcome
the “Reliability/Convenience of use” technical contraction. The U.S. patent
for a partitioned brake pad was applied by Richard C. Everett and granted on
Apr. 1999. The device was formed of different kinds of elastomers used
separately to improve wet and dry braking with one pad. The section view of
major invention shown in Figure 2.</p>

<b>Figure 2 - Patented Brake Shoe of bicycle</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">By combining the principles “Composite Materials” and “Mediators”,
an ideal design can be generated and a patent application developed
successfully. Referring to Figure 3, a movable member with soft rubber is
mounted on the nearly front end of brake shoes in the manner shown, with a
spring bias. The projecting surface of the movable member is pre-settled at an
offset from the engaging surface of the brake pad. For braking, the movable
member first touches the rim surface, and scrapes off water, grits, and dirt.
When the brake pad contacts the rim, an undiminished braking effect under
various weather conditions will be achieved. The system conflicts have been
solved successfully by the TRIZ method.</p>

<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In this study, the system requirements for the brake shoes of
the bicycle have been provided. The right formulations for solving the system
contractions are well established. A granted U.S. patent, shown in Figure 3, is
provided for a study case. It is proven that the results of contractions matrix
provides an excellent approach to innovate. In combination of the solving
principles that get from Altshuller’s Contraction Matrix with the different
system conflicts, a new conceptual design of the brake shoe pad that is suitable
for all weather conditions can be developed successfully.</p>
