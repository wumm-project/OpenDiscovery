<p><font size="-1" face="Century">I have just returned from <b><font color="#FF0000">a
personal trip to Russia and Belarus for two weeks from August 5 to August 20</font></b>
to meet a number of TRIZ related people.&nbsp; This article is a summary of the
trip for sharing the information with readers in Japan and in the world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1"><b><font color="#FF0000">My intention</font></b>
of this trip is to learn how TRIZ has been developed so far and is being
extended further currently in its home countries and then to consider how to
introduce TRIZ into Japan.&nbsp; Under the current situations of very limited
channels of introducing TRIZ references because of the language barrier
(especially between Russian and Japanese languages), I thought that
communications in person with TRIZ experts in these countries would be necessary
for this purpose.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1"><b><font color="#FF0000">My trip route</font></b>
was: Tokyo - Moscow - Minsk - St. Petersburg - Petrozavodsk - Moscow -
Tokyo.&nbsp; In the four cities, I met and discussed with the following TRIZ

gave me a lot of valuable information.&nbsp; Many more people helped me as
interpreters between Russian and English languages, as discussants, as guides,

Khomenko </font></b>of Minsk TRIZ School and <b><font color="#FF0000">Mr. Lev

<p><a name="Nakagawa: TRIZ in Japan"></a>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">During this trip, I made short
presentations in several occasions with a title of &quot;<b><font color="#FF0000">TRIZ
in Japan and TRIZ Viewed from a Japanese</font></b>&quot;.&nbsp; Main points of
my talk were as follows:</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">(a) TRIZ has been introduced into Japan
only since two or three years ago.&nbsp; An increasing number of industrial
engineers are now interested in TRIZ and its software tools, but they still have
difficulty in understanding TRIZ and in applying it to their actual problems.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">(b) I understand TRIZ as a combined
system of three aspects:</font></font><br>
<font face="Century"><font size="-1">Methodology (a) =&nbsp; New view of
technology</font></font><br>
<font face="Century"><font size="-1">Methodology (b) =&nbsp; Thinking way for
problem solving</font></font><br>
<font face="Century"><font size="-1">Knowledge base =&nbsp; A collection of
examples implementing the methodology (a)</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">This system has been well established by
Mr. Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues/students in the former USSR, but is
new to the western countries and has been and is going to give very important
impacts on technologies, industries, education, etc.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">(c) To make TRIZ applicable by a huge
number of newcomer technologists in the world, TRIZ needs to be
modernized.&nbsp; Among a number of modernization approaches, including&nbsp;
those by Invention Machine Corp. and by Ideation International Inc., I
personally feel the USIT approach by Ford Motor Co. is important; USIT is a much
simplified version of TRIZ.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">(d) To introduce TRIZ into Japan, I
believe that TRIZ should be targeted mainly to highly-educated technologists in
industries and that a &quot;slow-but-steady&quot; strategy of introduction
should be taken.&nbsp; This strategy puts stress on forming pioneering TRIZ
practitioners inside companies and on sharing reliable information on TRIZ.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">(e) I notice various extensions of
application fields of TRIZ other than technologies.&nbsp; I want to learn what
aspects of TRIZ are used and further extended in these new fields.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">(f) Education of TRIZ, or education with
the spirit of TRIZ, should be desirable.&nbsp; What kind of educational
activities are carried on? and how TRIZ can be taught to younger people?</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">Most part of my presentation was
accepted by Russian/Belarussian TRIZ specialists but some part caused a lot of
discussions, mostly because of a big difference in the stage of TRIZ acceptance
between in Russia/Belarus and in Japan, as explained below.</font></font><br>
&nbsp;
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">All through my visit, many people were
very kind to present their talks, to answer my questions, to discuss important
issues, to give me their original references, and so on.&nbsp; Information
obtained and issues of discussions are summarized below in accordance with their
topics.&nbsp; A list of references given to me during this trip is shown at the
end of this report; such references are quoted in [&nbsp;&nbsp; ] in the
relevant text.&nbsp; If the reader find any mistake/misunderstanding, please let
me know; I would like to correct them later.</font></font><br>

<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">The Minsk School of TRIZ was started by
Mr. Valerie Tsourikov (now President of Invention Machine Corp., USA) in 1976 in
Radio Electronic University and quickly acquired an all-city status.&nbsp; It
started in 1983 the &quot;<b><font color="#FF0000">Jonathan Livingston Project</font></b>&quot;

<p><font face="Century"><b><font color="#FF0000">(2) TRIZ School in St.
Petersburg</font></b><font size="-1"> (talk by Mr. Mitrofanov):</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In 1969, Mr. Mitrofanov happened to read
an article from a newspaper, accidentally appeared in his mailbox (this
newspaper he had not usually taken in), on Mr. Altshuller's school in Baku.&nbsp;
It's title was &quot;To educate for an Edison&quot;.&nbsp; Being interested in
the article, he searched hard and finally bought Altshuller's textbook
&quot;Algorithm of Invention&quot;.&nbsp; He was so amazed and read it three
times.&nbsp; Since he was a chief of the lab on a large semiconductors factory
&quot;Svetlana&quot; at that time, he had many technological problems to solve,
and Altshuller's textbook inspired him a hope.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">First, he gathered 20 young people
invited by Young Communist Party (Comsomol) as recommended by the factory's
authority as &quot;best people&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were glad to to listen to
him but they did not have problems to solve.&nbsp; He gave another three-day
seminar on &quot;How to Invent&quot; to 50 employees in the lab.&nbsp; But the
factory people rejected the new methodology.&nbsp; He went to higher director
and was allowed to give another seminar to 150 engineers, i.e., senior
technologists, well educated technical people; but it also was in vain because
they did not have time.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In 1970, following a suggestion by
director of Vyborgsky Cultural Centre, Mr. Mitrofanov opened a new evening
school.&nbsp; This was a success, resulting 20 good students coming
voluntarily.&nbsp; Mr. Vladimir Petrov (now in Israel) was among the first
students.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">A journalist wrote an article on this
class and Mr. Altshuller read it.&nbsp; Mr. Mitrofanov received a letter from
Mr. Altshuller written with a half-positive and half-critical stance.&nbsp; Then
he received a man sent by Mr. Altshuller for getting to know him better and
discussed with the man for full two days.&nbsp; After this discussion, he
received a second letter from Mr. Altshuller approving Mitrofanov's school as a
real TRIZ school; documents (a course of lectures, books, recommendations, etc.)
with one meter high came with the letter.&nbsp; He was requested at the same
time to report the school's activities every week or month.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In a year, the TRIZ school had to be
interrupted: the Cultural Centre was closed during long-lasting repair of
building.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">At this time, the official Society of
Soviet Innovators and Development Engineers (&quot;VOIR&quot;) stood against Mr.
Mitrofanov's evening school, because the new TRIZ methodology was considerably
better than their conventional ways.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">So he could not get official support for
TRIZ; and only with the support by Prof. Kamnev (very shortly before he died),
the TRIZ evening school restarted in a machinery factory and continued there for
three years.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In 1973, regular lectures started and
the school received good students.&nbsp; It was a two-year education
system.&nbsp; Some graduates became the teachers of the TRIZ School; they
include Mr. Litvin, Mr. Boris Zlotin, Mr.</font></font><br>
<font face="Century"><font size="-1">Vladimir Petrov, etc.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In this way St. Petersburg TRIZ School
became to make an important role in the TRIZ community.&nbsp; In Petrozavodsk
TRIZ Meeting held every year since 1974, once 70 people among the 200
participants were from St. Petersburg.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">During the period of Perestroika and
afterwards, many TRIZ specialists in St. Petersburg went abroad and some others
started firms by themselves.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">Nowadays, St. Petersburg TRIZ School has
60 to 70 students (once at maximum time 200 students).&nbsp; The TRIZ School is
operated as an evening school as before, and many students came from industries
as well as universities.&nbsp; The training is hard and only about 20 students
successfully defend their diplomas every year.&nbsp; (The contents of the
training will be described later.)</font></font><br>

<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">Mr. Genrich <font color="#000099">Saulovich</font>
Altshuller, the Founder of TRIZ, was born on October 15, 1926 in Tashkent in a
family of a journalist father.&nbsp; He graduated the Institute of Oil and
Chemistry in Baku.&nbsp; (He did not receive any higher academic degree, but
actually many people treated him just like a professor.)&nbsp;&nbsp; He
developed a talent of invention from his young age.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In 1946, Mr. Altshuller was working in
&quot;Department of Creating&quot; in the navy office in Baku for helping people
solve problems.&nbsp; While doing this job, he studied about many inventors, and
thought of a new technology for innovation.&nbsp; It included the steps to solve
technical contradiction.&nbsp; So he and Mr. R. V. Shapiro wrote a proposal to
Stalin that the invention processes should be much improved with their new
technology.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In 1949, he and Mr. Shapiro were
arrested and sent to a concentration camp.&nbsp; In the camp, Mr. Altshuller
found many excellent scientists in various fields and listened to their talks
(or lectures to Mr. Altshuller alone).&nbsp; He studied hard to understand and
memorize them at heart because no writing facilities were there.&nbsp; Thus he
obtained a wide range of knowledge and made his TRIZ technology stronger.&nbsp;
He refused to do labor work in the cold outdoor.&nbsp; This of course made
conflicts with the control officers and with other people in the camp.&nbsp; Mr.
Altshuller found a unique solution to comfort them; it was to tell them
interesting stories, in the form of scientific fictions.&nbsp; He created
various SF stories and became a good story teller.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In 1954, Mr. Altshuller was released
from the camp after Stalin's death, but could not have a job.&nbsp; So he wrote
scientific fictions with the pen name of H. Altov to earn money.&nbsp; He
travelled a lot and made seminars on his ideas of TRIZ technology of invention
in various places.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In 1956, Mr. Altshuller published his
first paper (with Mr. Shapiro as a coauthor) on TRIZ, i.e. &quot;About a
Technology of Creativity&quot;.&nbsp; He worked for ministry of construction for
some time.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In 1961, he published his first book
&quot;How to Learn to Invent&quot;.&nbsp; This book was printed and sold in
50,000 copies.&nbsp; He traveled around and gave seminars on TRIZ in various
places, and developed his work deeper.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In 1970, Mr. Altshuller was now allowed
to open an institute for invention technology in Baku.&nbsp; It was called
&quot;Azerbajan Institute of Invention Creativity&quot;.&nbsp; It was not an
institute in the official education system but a school opened on Sundays.&nbsp;
Engineers and university students came and studied on voluntary bases, besides
doing their normal jobs and university courses.&nbsp; The training was intensive
and contained a lot of homework for students to solve task problems and to make
his/her own inventions as diploma.&nbsp; It was a two-year course.&nbsp; Many
good students came and turned into TRIZ experts of the first generation.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In this period, Mr. Altshuller published
his book of &quot;Algorithms of Invention&quot; (first edition in 1969, and
second edition in 1973).&nbsp; This book included descriptions of ARIZ-71 and
the 40 Inventive Principles and the Table of technical contradiction
elimination.&nbsp;&nbsp; A video tape was made in 1973 as a TV program to
vividly document Mr. Altshuller's class.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In 1974, however, the authority
disapproved Altshuller's TRIZ school.&nbsp; Mr. Altshuller had to quit his
regular lectures, and most of his students went apart on their own ways.&nbsp;
This caused distribution of the first-generation TRIZ specialists in various
places in and around the former Soviet Union.&nbsp; They started their own
careers as TRIZ experts, and many of them taught their own students forming
groups of TRIZ specialists.&nbsp; Mr. Altshuller traveled around and gave
seminars in various places, e.g. Moscow, Baku, Novosibirsk, and other
cities.&nbsp; He received many letters from his students and his students'
students and replied to all the letters with detailed discussions on problem
solving methodologies.&nbsp; His books were translated into various languages,
such as Bulgarian, Finnish, German, etc. (but not in English in this
period).&nbsp; In this manner, he led all the development of TRIZ and its
activities until mid 1980s.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In 1985, the era of Perestroika
started.&nbsp; Many TRIZ specialists had to find new jobs/areas to work and some
of them emigrated to the western countries.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this period, Mr.
Altshuller shifted his main interest from TRIZ in technology to the Theory of
Development of Creative Personality.&nbsp; In 1989, the International
Association of TRIZ (i.e., &quot;MATRIZ&quot;, see below) was organized and Mr.
Altshuller became its President.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In 1990, due to the unstable social
situations after the end of the former USSR, Mr. Altshuller left Baku to live in
Petrozavodsk, a city 300 km north of St. Petersburg.&nbsp; His health was not in
a good condition, but he continued his work and published a new book &quot;How
to Become a Genius&quot; [21] with Mr. Igor M. Vertkin in 1994.&nbsp; He
continued his intensive letter communications, received many guests/students at
his apartment, and&nbsp; talked much about TRIZ, creative personality, and
necessity of high morality in using TRIZ.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In summer 1998, he selected 65 people in
the world as &quot;TRIZ Masters&quot; and issued the diplomas with his
signature.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">On September 24, 1998, Mr. Genrich
Saurovich Altshuller died in Petrozavodsk at the age of 71 finising his devotion
to the mankind through his study of technology of&nbsp; invention and creative
personality.</font></font>

her medical internship in Baku, and got married with him in 1956.&nbsp; After
his influence, she became a writer of scientific fictions and published several
books.&nbsp; She showed me her two works published in Japanese translation in
1959 and 1968.&nbsp; She was also trained by him as a TRIZ specialist and a good
secretary/editor.&nbsp; Mr. Altshuller did not use a personal computer after his

<p><font face="Century"><b><font color="#FF0000">(6)&nbsp; Training on TRIZ</font></b><font size="-1">&nbsp;
(Talk by Mr. Mitrofanov and talk by Ms. Zinovkina)</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">Training courses on TRIZ are carried out
in a number of TRIZ schools in Russia, Belarus, and other countries.&nbsp; They
have Mr. Altshuller's TRIZ school in Baku as their model.&nbsp; The training is
intensive and high level.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1"><b><font color="#FF0000">The TRIZ School
in St. Petersburg</font></b> is currently operated as follows:</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">The school is operated as two-year
course with two days a week.&nbsp; Lectures are given by Mr. Mitrofanov and
several other TRIZ specialists.&nbsp; The course is well established but does
not use any fixed textbook; the Mitrofanov's recent book [8] and Mr. Iwanov's
book [11] contain essential parts of their lectures at this course.&nbsp; There
is a collection of problems &amp; solutions; each student has to solve 100 to
120 problems per year.&nbsp; This requires hard work at the school and at
home.&nbsp; At the end of the first year, students have to defend their
pre-diploma; students are anxious about and often afraid of this.&nbsp; At the
end of the second year, students have to defend their diploma.&nbsp; This
diploma defending is done openly on the third day of the School's Celebration
Days in front of the audience of about 90 people.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">Currently the School has 60 to 70
students.&nbsp; Many of them are engineers and businessmen, who are working
after their graduation of universities/institutes.&nbsp; University students are
also attending at the TRIZ course while they are studying in their various major
fields.&nbsp; Lectures are given in one class.&nbsp; The course requests a high
standard in the diploma and about 20 students successfully defend the diploma
every year.&nbsp; Only highly educated people succeed in the diploma.&nbsp; Mr.
Mitrofanov believes there is no simple way to learn TRIZ.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">As another example of TRIZ school, I am
going to summarize the<b><font color="#FF0000"> curriculum in Moscow's
Inter-University Center:</font></b></font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">The training of engineers (i.e.,
university graduates in technology) is usually done as a sequence of intensive
seminars.&nbsp; An intensive seminar of 4 to 5 days (with 8 hours per day) forms
one unit.&nbsp; Separating by a week or longer, three to four units of the
seminar are taught in sequence.&nbsp; Thus the course contain about 120 hours of
training.&nbsp; The separation of the seminars is supposed to be desirable for
the trainees to think about the lectures/lessons in their own
environments.&nbsp; For the graduation, the trainees must make their own
invention during the course.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">For the education of university
students, the Center provides a 220 hour course throughout the 4 years.&nbsp;
Students of science, technology, humanity, etc. may attend the course.&nbsp;
Various aspects of TRIZ are taught in steps during the 4 years.&nbsp; Students
are requested to solve a large number of problems during the course, and to make
an invention for the graduation.</font></font><br>
&nbsp;
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">During the <b><font color="#FF0000">discussion</font></b>,
when I talked about 3-hour lectures and 3-day training seminiars on TRIZ (and on
USIT), Russian and Belarussian TRIZ specialists all thought them &quot;too
short&quot; and do not seem to understand their necessity.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">My point here is that in every country
it should be necessary to provide a full set of courses; which may include
3-hour lectures, 3-day training seminars, 3-month training courses, and 2-year
education courses, etc.&nbsp; Short lectures and seminars are necessary for busy
industry people and suitable for beginners.&nbsp; In Japan, currently there are
no TRIZ specialists who have taken long-term education of TRIZ; this means that
we should make much serious efforts for fully understanding TRIZ and for
establishing high-quality teaching courses of TRIZ in Japan.&nbsp; It may be
necessary to open such a course in English at first (maybe not in Russian).</font></font>
<p><a name="7.  Technical TRIZ"></a>
<p><b><font face="Century"><font color="#FF0000">(7)&nbsp; Understanding the
Classical/Technical TRIZ</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">The Classical TRIZ (mostly in the
technology fields) has been published in textbooks by Mr. Altshuller and a few
others in Russian.&nbsp; But many of them were limited in number of copies, and
are now not easy to buy through bookstores.&nbsp; Translation into English and
further into Japanese is desirable for better understanding.&nbsp; The language
barrier is the most serious problem which delays the acceptance of TRIZ in Japan
(and in other western countries).</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">I talked with many TRIZ specialists and
pointed out the <b><font color="#FF0000">needs of good examples of solving
technical problems</font></b> for Japanese TRIZ learners.&nbsp; But for the
Russian/Belarussian TRIZ specialists, the usefulness of TRIZ in technologies
seems to be an old issue well proven in the history.&nbsp; They say there are a
lot of real applications documented well in official/published reports.&nbsp; In
Minsk <b><font color="#FF0000">Mr. Shpakovsky</font></b>&nbsp; has presented his
work on the development of a new design of a stripper (i.e., a tractor for
harvesting)[3].&nbsp; In Petrozavodsk, <b><font color="#FF0000">Mr. Rubin</font></b>
showed his work of an electrical power station built at a neck of a bay in the
Northern Sea for using ebb and flow of tide; but the thick document was written
in Russian and I could not read it.&nbsp; Since there are a lot of examples in
textbooks and course materials in their mother tongue (Russian), the application
of TRIZ in technology fields seems for them rather trivial practices.&nbsp; In
Japan, we need to overcome this demerit of lack of readable examples as soon as
possible.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">On the other hand, Russian and
Belarussian TRIZ specialists do not seem to have successful experiences of <b><font color="#FF0000">introducing
TRIZ into companies</font></b> (or similar industrial organizations) in a larger
scale (such as hundreds of engineers).&nbsp; They seem to work as consultants or
expert leaders in their jobs in such organizations, i.e., without large-scale
knowledge transfer of TRIZ to company engineers.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In Moscow I learned that a company is
now going to send ten engineers to the university's TRIZ training course.&nbsp;
I have not heard of any actual results from former cases of similar group
training.&nbsp; Since the training courses are well established with
high-quality staff, such training would make fruits in future.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">It was interesting that Mr. Kucheravy of
Minsk TRIZ School worked as a consultant in a <b><font color="#FF0000">South-Korean
big company</font></b> for one year, came back to Minsk for a month, and was
just going to the company for the second year.&nbsp; Korean companies often
behave in a way similar to US companies.&nbsp; We, Japanese TRIZ promoters,
should learn more seriously their trials of inviting TRIZ consultants from
abroad.</font></font>

Technological Rejection to Scientific Discovery</font></b>&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since this is written in Russian, I cannot read it at moment; Mr. Klementyev
kindly spent time to translate the chapter titles into English for me.&nbsp;
Using physics of microelectronic devices and physical chemistry as examples, Mr.
Mitrofanov wrote his unique approaches to scientific discovery on the basis of
TRIZ philosophy.&nbsp; The book is based on his lectures at the St. Petersburg
TRIZ school, and published in September 1998 with only 550 copies.&nbsp; This
book should be translated into English/Japanese.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1"><b><font color="#FF0000">Mr. Timohov</font></b>
(from Gomel, Belarus) gave me his work [7], a book &quot;<b><font color="#FF0000">A
Collection of Creative Problems in Biology, Ecology, and TRIZ</font></b>&quot;
(written in Russian).&nbsp;&nbsp; He posed 80 examples and discussed on them
using TRIZ.&nbsp; Biology and ecology are new fields of application for TRIZ.</font></font>

<p><b><font face="Century"><font color="#FF0000">(9)&nbsp; Extensions of the
TRIZ applications to services, business management, etc.</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">I met many TRIZ specialists who had much
experiences of applying TRIZ to technical problems and lately changed their main
activity fields into services, business management, etc. and are still using
TRIZ.&nbsp; Social and economic situations in the former USSR since late 1980s
urged or forced them into these changes, they say.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">My main interests in interviewing these
people are:&nbsp; What aspects of TRIZ can be used and what kind of extensions
of TRIZ are necessary in the new fields of business-related areas?</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1"><b><font color="#FF0000">Mr. Timohov</font></b>,

<font face="Century"><font size="-1">&nbsp; (b) contradiction,</font></font><br>

<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1"><b><font color="#FF0000">Mr. Faer</font></b>,
in St. Petersburg, says he changed his main working area from technology to
social/business area around 1990 and is working actively in advertisement by
forming a political consultant group.&nbsp; On my question &quot;What are the
main principles of TRIZ you use in the new field?&quot;, he pointed out the
following three:</font></font><br>
<font face="Century"><font size="-1">&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Contradictions,</font></font><br>
<font face="Century"><font size="-1">&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Ideal Solution, and</font></font><br>
<font face="Century"><font size="-1">&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; to turn harm into benefit.</font></font><br>
<font face="Century"><font size="-1">As an example of the contradiction, he
mentioned about the propaganda for election campaign and said &quot;People do
not want to read, but take a glance.&quot;&nbsp; So he used small slips of paper
for the campaign.&nbsp; In the slips, he wrote his main messages not directly
but in a way people can natuarally go further in their mind.&nbsp; As an example
of Ideal Solution, he followed the principles of &quot;minimal expenses&quot;
and &quot;not existing&quot; by using rumors instead of the paper slips.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">Mr. Faer gave me his book [12] &quot;<b><font color="#FF0000">Methods
of Strategies and Tactics of Election Campaign</font></b>&quot; (1998).&nbsp; He
selected 73 methods and explained them with formulation, comments, etc.&nbsp;
While talking with him I recalled the tactics written in ancient Chinese
literatures; and he showed me his citation of them at the end of his book.&nbsp;
Mr. Faer says that the most important message he obtained from TRIZ is &quot;Be
brave to solve problems&quot;.&nbsp; He believes TRIZ is applicable to life and
any other areas.&nbsp; He loves his new application fields because the responses
of his trials come back in a day, instead of months or years.&nbsp; See his Web
site in English at&nbsp; http://users.nevalink.ru/faer/index_en.htm .</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1"><b><font color="#FF0000">Mr. Rubin</font></b>,
in Petrozavodsk, says that TRIZ is a technology of thinking (i.e., a philosophy
in your mind) and that the following three points are the essence of TRIZ and
are useful in business-oriented problems as well:</font></font><br>
<font face="Century"><font size="-1">&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; To find and analyze the
conflicts,</font></font><br>
<font face="Century"><font size="-1">&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Ideal solution,</font></font><br>
<font face="Century"><font size="-1">&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; &quot;Using their/all
opportunities&quot;</font></font><br>
<font face="Century"><font size="-1">He, of course, pointed out the necessity of
specialized knowledge in business, etc. but found TRIZ useful as the
background.&nbsp; He is now working for Karelia Republic (whose capital is
Petrozavodsk and whose population is 0.8 million) in a number of projects,
teaching at business training seminars, and working as a professional business
consultant.&nbsp; On hearing of the three points, I was rather surprised with
their similarity to the ones commented by Mr. Faer.&nbsp; So I asked him if
there was any consensus on this issue; he said there was no consensus but he
just understood TRIZ in such a way.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1"><b><font color="#FF0000">Discussions</font></b>
with these TRIZ specialists have revealed to me that they use TRIZ as their way
of thinking and would not depend on details of invention principles,
contradiction matrix, technological effects, etc.&nbsp; I understand that since
these specialists understood and used TRIZ in its depth for many years before
their shifting their work fields, they were rather free of details of TRIZ and
tried to tackle new problems by using the core philosophy of TRIZ.&nbsp; This
situation may be much different from those for the western people who knew
various methodologies but TRIZ in the business-related fields and are lately
trying to learn and use TRIZ.&nbsp;&nbsp; This point should be considered
carefully when any new TRIZ learners try to apply TRIZ to the business-related
areas.</font></font>

method, developing creative imagination, contradiction solving through theme
work, etc.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">I was not sure how these TRIZ methods
could be taught to children in kindergartens; so I asked.&nbsp; On my request,

a letter in an envelope; its subsystem is characters, and its supersystem is an
airplane for airmails.&nbsp; The old system may be drawn as smoke from
fire.&nbsp; Then, children of 5 to 6 years old can often reply the system in the
future as &quot;a computer&quot;, she says.&nbsp; In this scheme, various ideas
are presented with pictures of examples and verbal communication.&nbsp; Children

worked on the Theory of Development of Creative Persons for years; but the

In Japan, the introduction of TRIZ is very new, since only two or three years
ago.&nbsp; Industrial engineers are now interested in TRIZ and want to try to
use it in their actual problems.&nbsp; So, we should train them first and prove
the effectiveness of TRIZ by ourselves in Japan.&nbsp; When we are confident of
TRIZ's effectiveness, then we can go ahead to teach TRIZ in universities to
engineering students.&nbsp; Then the education should come down step by step to
lower and lower people.&nbsp; We cannot (and should not) skip any of the steps
for safer and better education.</font></font>

to children must understand TRIZ deeply and must understand children's
psychology, he was saying.&nbsp; At home, Mr. Altshuller himself taught his
grand daughter Yuna affectionately in her childhood to let her understand the
essence of the TRIZ philosophy.</font></font>

should carefully distinguish teaching new (and apparently creative at moment)
methodologies to children from bringing up creative abilities in children.&nbsp;
This argument may come deeper to <b><font color="#FF0000">the issue of the
nature of creativity with TRIZ</font></b>.&nbsp; If a person remember various
problems, solutions, principles, effects, etc. in the TRIZ textbooks, and can
use them almost automatically to various problems, is he/she really
creative?&nbsp; The answer should be YES on the apparant basis of his/her
solutions and inventions; but is he/she really creating or just following
precedants?&nbsp; Can he/she get out of the TRIZ way of thinking and think by
him/herself?</font></font>
<p><a name="11.  International Asociation of TRIZ"></a>
<p><font face="Century"><b><font color="#FF0000">(11)&nbsp; International
Association of TRIZ</font></b><font size="-1"> (talk by Mr. Mitrofanov and by
Mr. Rubin)</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">The International Association of TRIZ
(whose Russian abbriviation is &quot;<b><font color="#FF0000">MATRIZ</font></b>&quot;)
was established in 1989 with Mr. Altshuller as the President.&nbsp; At present,
Mr. Mitrofanov is the President and Mr. Rubin serves as the Director under the
Board Meeting.&nbsp; It includes a number of TRIZ specialist groups voluntarily
organized in the units of cities, regions, or countries: such as TRIZ Moscow,
TRIZ St. Petersburg, etc.&nbsp; The <b><font color="#FF0000">Altshuller
Institute for TRIZ Studies</font></b> (in USA) is one of such organizations,
from the standpoint of the Association.&nbsp; The Association's rule says any
three persons can form such a unit and belong to the Association with the
membership due of 100 US dollars per person.&nbsp; The Association now uses
Russian language as the formal language, but is going to open a Web site in
English as well.&nbsp; The Association publishes the &quot;<b><font color="#FF0000">Journal
of TRIZ</font></b>&quot; in Russian (I am not sure how many volumes have been
published recently).&nbsp; See the official Web site:&nbsp; http://matriz.karelia.ru/
.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">I was urged by Mr. Mitrofanov to
organize a unit &quot;<b><font color="#FF0000">TRIZ Japan</font></b>&quot;, but
I responded that it may be too early.&nbsp; In Japan, we should first think of a
possibility of forming a nonprofit society of TRIZ as one of academic societies
in technology.&nbsp; We would like to make it a society in which all the people
who are interested in TRIZ may come and work/study together independent of their
affiliations and fields.&nbsp; I feel the organization of such a society needs a
lot of efforts and is still too early to start.</font></font>
<p><a name="12.  Language barrier and translation"></a>
<p><b><font face="Century"><font color="#FF0000">(12)&nbsp; Language Barrier and
Necessity of Translation</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">During this trip I was happy because
every group provided good interpreters between Russian and English languages for
communication.&nbsp; But once I am back in Japan and want to read books and
references, I am facing the serious problem of the language barrier to
Russian.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, it took much time for me to make a list of
references (given to me during the trip) in the bottom of this report.&nbsp;
Though I have been learning the Russian language for these 16 months, I cannot
at all read the texts yet.&nbsp; It may take a few more years for me to be able
to read them for myself.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">It is very much desirable in Japan to <b><font color="#FF0000">translate
a number of important textbooks and references from Russian to Japanese</font></b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unfortunately, however, there are very few Russian-to-Japanese translators
available yet in Japan.&nbsp; We have to make serious efforts for finding good
translators from Russian to Japanese and good publishers who understand the
importance of introducing TRIZ.&nbsp; If any reader of this report has
connections with such people/organization, please let me know by email.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">During the trip, I was also asked from
Russian authors about any possibility of publicizing their works much wider in
Japan and other countries.&nbsp; Such publication will certainly have benefits
to the authors.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">For solving this language barrier
partly, I think there are <b><font color="#FF0000">two other ways</font></b>.&nbsp;
One is that the Russian people translate their works into English and publish
them in books, journals, or Web sites.&nbsp;&nbsp; Second is that people in any
country translate the Russian references into English and publish them.&nbsp; In
Japan, three TRIZ textbooks are already published in this way translating from
Russian into English and further into Japanese.&nbsp; Since <b><font color="#FF0000">English</font></b>
is now the defact common language in the world, publication in English may be a
necessity.</font></font>
<p><a name="13.  Impression as a tourist"></a>
<p><b><font face="Century"><font color="#FF0000">(13)&nbsp; Impression of Russia
and Belarus as a tourist</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">Before this trip, I had the only
experience of stopping over in Moscow for two days in 1973.&nbsp;&nbsp; Last
time and this time, I stayed in the same hotel in Moscow, i.e. Intourist
Hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp; St. Petersburg, Petrozavodsk, and Minsk were all new to me
(and my wife) in this trip.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">The impression of <b><font color="#FF0000">Moscow</font></b>
this time was sad in my eyes which remember the glory of the old days.&nbsp;
Main streets in the center of the city are dirty with dusts and many old cars
are rashing dangerously and crowdedly on very wide roads.&nbsp; There are a
number of shopping centers in the city selling imported costumes, perfumes,
watches, and souvenirs, but they are rather monotonic and do not sell things for
everyday life for ordinary people.&nbsp; I visited some department stores and
food shops along the main streets, and disappointed to find very few
merchandizes.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1">In Moscow I visited Kremlin, Dostevsky's
house, Albert Street, etc.&nbsp; I used the metros conveniently and safely and
found many beautifully-built metro stations.&nbsp; There are many poor people
begging donations in metro stations and sightseeing places.&nbsp; I feel sorry
for their lives especially in cold winters.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1"><b><font color="#FF0000">St. Petersburg</font></b>
gave me better impression.&nbsp; It is a beautiful city with a lot of nice
buildings since the era before the revolution.&nbsp; Many churches and old
nobles' palaces have been restored recently.&nbsp; Parks and gardens are located
in the city center area and are clean.&nbsp; The roads, however, are very bad;
especially the rail bases of streetcars are terribly damaged everywhere probably
because of the heavy traffic of cars.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1"><b><font color="#FF0000">Petrozavodsk</font></b>
is a nice small city having the population of 400,000.&nbsp; It is located on a
beautiful lake and among woods.&nbsp; The life seems to be quiet and I did not
see any sign of economical crisis from my eyes as a tourist.&nbsp; The TRIZ
community in this city seem to know one another closely.</font></font>
<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1"><b><font color="#FF0000">Minsk</font></b>
is a city of widely-spread modern buildings, because the city was reconstructed
after the war from disastrous damages.&nbsp; The economic situations of Belarus
is severe, I am told.&nbsp; One US dollar is officially equivalent to 300,000
Belarussian Rubles, but actually equibalent to 440,000 Belarussian Rubles in
black markets.&nbsp; Ordinary wallet is not large enough, and people use a
rubber band to hold a bundle of bills.&nbsp; In a park at the city center, a
monument of mothers with tears is standing for comforting the soldiers killed in
the Afghanistan War.&nbsp; This monument is the most deeply impressive and
beautiful one I ever saw.</font></font><br>

<p><font face="Century"><font size="-1"><b><font color="#FF0000">In arranging

submit a detailed itinerary and a set of vouchers of hotel and transportation
reservations for obtaining the visas.&nbsp; Since I could not get a full support
from Japanese travel agencies. I searched and found this Russia/US-based agency
on the Internet (http://www.interknowledge.com/russia/irene/).&nbsp; Email
