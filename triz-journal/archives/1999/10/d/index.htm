<p></font>Presented are the TRIZ methodologies and results of using these tools
on a graduate research topic concerning the properties of a particle filled
fiber. A problem arose from drawing these particle filled fibers. The main focus
of the student was to employ the ARIZ algorithm to develop highly innovative
solutions. At least one innovative solution is generated. A variant of this same
solution has been employed successfully in the liquid crystal industry.</p>
<b>
<p>Introduction</p>
</b>
<p>The first question one might ask is why even add particles to a polymer.
Rigid particles can improve some of the properties of the bulk polymer. Modulus,
resistance to creep, and fracture toughness are all improved. Also the
coefficient of thermal expansion is lowered. My research work and specific
problem deal with the modulus properties of a particle filled polypropylene
fiber. In particular the problem centers on the reduction of modulus of a drawn
filled fiber when compared to an undrawn filled fiber.</p>
<p>Our composite fiber consisted of two main phases, polypropylene matrix and
particulate wollastonite filler. The particle filler wollastonite is a needle
shaped mineral crystal. The wollastonite looks like a fine white powder to the
naked eye. Our fiber forming process begins by mixing these two phases. The
mixing takes place in an Atlas mixing extruder. Small amounts of polymer chips
and particle powder are alternately poured into the hopper located on the mixer.
The amount of particle added depends on the volume fraction desired for the
final composite fiber. The polymer melts around the particle as the composite
rod is extruded from the mixer. This rod is then chipped and ground into a
coarse powder. This powder is then returned to the hopper located on the mixer.
The coarse powder is then extruded once again to improve the distribution of the
particle in the polymer. The rod extruded from this second mixing is then
chipped and ground into a coarse powder. This powder is then extruded into a
fiber using the Bradford melt extruder. The fiber exits the spinneret and drops
approximately three feet into a water bath to quench the fibers. From the water
bath the fiber is wound onto a cardboard tube using a winding machine. These
fibers are then hand drawn at 80<font face="Symbol">°</font> C. The drawing
strengthens the polymer by orienting the molecular chains in the direction of
the long fiber axis. Drawing should also orient our needle shaped particles more
closely to the long fiber axis. Without drawing the fibers are brittle which
makes them hard to handle or prepare for testing.</p>
<b>
<p>Problem Description</p>
</b>
<p>The effect we attained from drawing was completely opposite from what we had
hypothesized. Therefore the strengthening effects cause by drawing may not apply
directly to particle filled systems. After testing samples of the drawn and
undrawn fibers with the same volume fraction an unexpected result was observed.
When compared to the undrawn samples the drawn samples had a lower modulus. We
believe this is due to the generation of voids in the fiber during drawing. As
the fiber is drawn the polymer is pulled away from the particle causing a
debonding of the particle from the polymer. In effect a hole is created in the
fiber, which leads to a decrease in modulus. How can we orient the polymer
molecular chains and not debond the particle?</p>
<b>
<p>How Can TRIZ Help?</p>
</b>
<p>Hopefully by using TRIZ I can reduce if not prevent psychological inertia,
identify and resolve contradictions instead of compromising, and develop higher
level innovative solutions. With such a complex problem I decided that ARIZ
would be the best place to start. Also ARIZ seemed to be the best way to employ
all of the TRIZ tools systematically and hopefully generate ideas at each step
in the process.</p>
<b>
<p>ARIZ</p>
</b>
<p>The first step is mini-problem formulation. A description of the problem in
generic terms will be formed. This step should identify the useful and harmful
functions, tools and products. Contradictions should begin to be elucidated.
This process begins with finding the Key Problem, debonding the particle during
drawing. Therefore energy is the Useful Function Tool and moving the polymer
molecular chains is the Useful Function Product. The Harmful Function Tool is
also energy, which separates the particle from the polymer, Harmful Function
Product. If this energy is large the molecules are moved but the particles are
separated from the polymer. If this energy is small the particles are not
separated from the polymer but the polymer molecular chains are not moved
either. Herein lies the initial contradiction; the energy needs to be both large
and small. Therefore it is essential under minimum changes to the system to move
molecules without separating particles from the polymer.</p>
<p>The next step involves trying to solve this contradiction discovered in the
first step. Since the contradiction is a physical contradiction one can use the
Separation Principles: separation in time, space, upon condition, and within a
whole and its parts. Applying <b><i>Separation in Time</i></b> reveals our first
glimpse of solutions.</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Orient the polymer molecules before the bond forms between the polymer and
    the particle. This could be achieved by drawing the fiber while the polymer
    is still molten. This idea is similar to principle 10. Prior Action.</li>
  <li>Form or reform the bond after the polymer molecules have been drawn. This
    could be achieved by using the different thermal conductivity properties of
    the two phases. If the particle can be made to absorb heat quicker than the
    polymer, hot spots will form wherever these particles are found. These hot
    spots could then melt the polymer around them reforming the bond between the
    particle and the polymer. Heat does not have to be added to generate the hot
    spots. Sound or radiation could be used to make the particles vibrate. If
    the particles vibrate fast enough they could melt the polymer around them.
    This idea is very similar to the microwave oven. Microwave radiation excites
    the water molecules creating heat and thereby cooking the food item.</li>
</ol>
<p>Applying <b><i>Separation in Upon Condition</i></b> gave me the following
ideas.</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Orient the polymer molecules while the particle is in a fluid state. In
    this case the particle would be free to move with the moving polymer
    molecules. The particle could be dissolved and mixed with molten polymer to
    form an emulsion. Once the orientation was finished the particle is
    solidified. This idea is similar to principle 35. Transformation of Chemical
    or Physical States.</li>
</ol>
<p>Already at this early point in ARIZ we begin to get solutions. We also see
how useful the Separation Principles are when applied to physical
contradictions. The physical contradiction can also be transformed into a
technical contradiction. This is why the similarity was pointed out in the
solutions listed above.</p>
<p>In the next step the conflict is enforced and extrapolated to extremes. If
very large energy is applied the particle is separated and floats free from the
polymer. If even more energy is applied maybe just to the particle we arrive at
an idea very similar to those above. The particle could move fast enough to
generate heat from friction cause between the particle and polymer. At the other
extreme if a very small energy is applied the particles are not separated.
However a solution may lie in applying the small energy with periodic action
which is principle 19. Apply a frequency of energy like a small periodic drawing
force. This force should over time orient the molecules of the polymer. The
movement of the molecules should be slow enough to allow the particle to also
slowly move with the polymer and thereby prevent the rapid debonding seen in our
original process.</p>
<p>The next few steps of the ARIZ algorithm are designed to allow the problem
solver to focus on the resources available or resources needed for solutions.
These resources could take the form of fields or objects. For my system it is
essential to introduce some resource X which prevents the separation of the
particle from the polymer and does not prevent the molecules of the polymer from
moving during drawing. Often times it is helpful to sketch the system using
Substance Field Modeling. These diagrams allow the problem solver to identify
the fields and substance present in their system. Once this knowledge is
obtained one can decided if their system is complete. These diagrams also allow
one to see the desired, insufficient, and harmful interactions between forces
and substances in the system. If we diagram our system during drawing we find it
contains two forces. There is a mechanical force from the drawing action and a
thermal force applied by drawing at 80<font face="Symbol">°</font> C. The two
substances are the molecules of the polymer and the particle. This situation
gives us a combined Su-Field model. The mechanical and thermal forces have a
harmful interaction with the particle. These same forces have a desired effect
with the molecules of the polymer. The mechanical and thermal forces also lead
to an insufficient interaction between the polymer and the particle (see
appendix B). To correct these interactions we need to introduce some substances
to block or modify the interactions into desired interactions. A substance that
would increase the interaction between the particle and the polymer could
possibly block the effect of the two fields on the particle. Something like a
coupling agent or a surface treatment could increase the chemical bond energy
greater than the energies of the two fields. Another visual tool that is useful
for analyzing the system is Operational Zone Analysis. The operational zone can
be broken down into the Harmful Function Operation Zone and The Useful Function
Operational Zone. The HFOZ of my system contains the particle and the interface
between the particle and the polymer. The UFOZ contains the molecules of the
polymer. These two zones overlap where the molecules of the polymer enter the
interface between the polymer and the particle (see appendix C). This overlap
zone can be further broken down Using Smart Little Persons Modeling. The current
system contains two types of people, particle and polymer people. The particle
people are rigid on the surface of the particle. The polymer people form a chain
by holding onto each other’s feet. At one end of this chain the polymer people
hold onto the particle people (see appendix D). When a force is applied that
moves the polymer people their grip to the particle people is broken. Therefore
the ideal situation would be the polymer people move without letting go of the
particle people. Or conversely the particle people could be free to move on the
surface of the particle while the polymer molecules are moving. This would be
the case if the particle where a fluid. The fluid state would allow the particle
people to absorb the energy by moving; therefore, the energy is not concentrated
on the rigid bond between the particle and polymer.</p>
<b>
<p>Possible Solution</p>
</b>
<p>Fluid Particle</p>
<p>During drawing the molecules of the polymer move and orient with the
mechanical force of drawing. Some of these polymer molecules are bonded to a
fluid particle that has been distributed in the polymer. As the molecules of the
polymer move the particle molecules on the surface of the particle attached to
them are also free to move. In this case the bond between the particle and the
polymer is not stressed to the same degree as with the rigid particle. Now once
orientation of the polymer molecules is attained the particles can be solidified
to obtained the desired rigid particle. Radiation like ultraviolet radiation is
used to cross-link and solidify polymer matrices. If a liquid crystal particle
is used the particle can be oriented with a weak field and solidified under
these orientation conditions. This liquid crystal technology is used with
polymer dispersed liquid crystal display devices. Small droplets of liquid
crystal are dispersed in the polymer. The molecules of these droplets orient
with a weak electric or magnetic field allowing light to pass through the panel.
This particle orientation also has an added benefit. An increased load bearing
capability in the direction of the orientation is achieved.</p>
