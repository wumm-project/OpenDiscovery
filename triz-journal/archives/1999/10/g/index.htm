<p>Functions of Pedagogy</p>
</font></b>
<p>Pedagogy (from the Greek <i>paidagogike</i>) is the science of educating
people.</p>
<p>A basic consequence of human evolution was the growth in the amount of
information that needed to be passed from one generation to the next. Pedagogy,
as a way to transfer information, improv­ed the course of evolution. It
followed the criterion of ideality (as does any system created by human beings)
by providing the maximum useful effect for minimum retribution in terms of
money, work, time, loss of information, losses due to poor education, and so on.</p>
<p>In the early stages of human evolution, pedagogy, as we understand, did not
exist. Children lived side-by-side with adults, contributed to housekeeping as
they were able, and gradually acquired the necessary life skills without special
training. As life became more complex, it became impossible to acquire the
required knowledge and skills without special education. Furthermore, children
hindered the activities of adults, which were becoming more complicated and, at
times, dangerous.</p>
<p>Initially, pedagogy was more or less “individually” oriented. Only a
small number of children (primarily the children of the wealthy) received
education, which took place in the home. In the course of social evolution,
however, it became clear that it is necessary to teach all children; and the
demand for “mass pedagogic production” emerged. As in any area of human
achievement, the transition to mass production resulted in deterioration in “product”
quality. (The first muskets made on a mass scale were greatly inferior to
hand-made ones.) And as in other areas, attempts were made to return to the past
- to some method of individual education. This can benefit some individual
children but, from a social viewpoint, has always been a “blind alley.” The
correct way is to develop methods of producing high quality mass education.</p>
<p>Developing a “mass pedagogy” meant the creation of specialized subsystems
- a type of “reser­vation” for children. The functions of these
reservations are to separate children from the lives of the adults, and to
purposely prepare them for, in due course, such a life. A child is isolated from
social life and finds himself living within “protected walls,” like an
astronaut in a space suit. To support life, an astronaut must have communication
with other people as well as air, water, food, etc. - i. e., at least minimum
compensation must be made for the absence of the common, earthy conditions of
life. Similarly, children whose contact with society is interrupted should be
compen­sated as well. Pedagogy is called upon to act as the “space suit’s”
compensatory functions. This space suit should be made in such a way that a
child will be well provided for. As the child matures, the size of the space
suit must become larger and the child’s level of isolation diminish so that,
when the space suit is removed, he/she can quickly become a full member of
society. History has shown, however, that the pedagogical “space-suits” made
by adults serve first and foremost the convenience of the adults.</p>
<p>Once mass pedagogy was developed, the simplest way to ensure its
effectiveness was to force children to study and to punish them (even harshly)
for insufficient studiousness. (By the way, the high level of education in
Russia during the 1950 through 1970s accounted, to a large extent, for the
strong system of punishment.) These methods are effective for acquiring
knowledge and skills, but they restrain the child’s self-esteem, love of
freedom, self-confidence, and so on. Moreover, these methods progress in
countries that have totalitarian regimes, because the educational system is also
totalitarian. But for these reasons, this method will not do for use in American
schools. It contradicts the tendencies of the evolution of a democratic society.
The democratic way to increase the effectiveness of education is to consider the
child’s desires and needs.</p>

<p>Do Humans Need a Lot?</p>
</font></b>
<p>Freud wrote that, a human being, in the beginning of his/her life, strives
for pleasure. Later, he/she learns to correlate pleasure with possible
retribution, i. e., begins to follow the “reality principle.” Thus, the
human motivating power is striving for positive emotions (PE) and avoiding
negative emotions (NE). Let us refer to this as “personal ideality.”</p>
<p align="center">Total PE<br>
Personal Ideality = ------------------- (tends to increase)<br>
Total NE</p>
<p>The way to achieve positive emotions is through the satisfaction of certain
human needs.</p>
<p>Abraham Maslow<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> formed a hierarchical structure
of human needs - from physiological needs (the lowest) to spiritual demands (the
highest).</p>
<p align="CENTER">Self-actualization needs<br>

Fig. 1. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Human Needs</p>
<p>Unsatisfied needs, the contradiction between the desire to satisfy them and
the increase in retribution factors and limited resources, the contradiction
between various needs, and between people in their struggles to satisfy these
needs, were the motivating power of personal behavior and human progress.</p>
<p>Of course, Maslow mentions only basic needs that, to a certain degree, are
inborn (i.e., genetically implanted). An infinite number of specific needs, more
or less common and strong (ranging from a love of ice-cream to a love for
symphonic music) are being formed, based on these needs, in the process of
general human evolution and individual maturation.</p>
<p>One of the basic functions of pedagogy is the formation of a system of needs.
Merely the formation of needs makes it possible to manage a child’s education.</p>
<p>Existential (from the Latin <i>existentia</i>,<i> </i>“existence”) needs
are the needs that must be satisfied for basic existence. These are closely
connected to the instinct of self-preservation, which requires a personal
knowledge and understanding of one’s surroundings, and of how to exist and be
succes­sful in these surroundings. These needs create an “investigative
behavior” peculiar to every animated creature, and which, in people, becomes
curiosity.</p>
<p>The human need for collective, imitative behavior (a child imitates others),
and the possibility of enhanced prestige by means of education, can play a
significant part in education.</p>
<p>However, our experience in educating children has shown that the most
important need that allows the process of children’s education to be managed
is the need for creativity. There are various levels of creativity, as well as
varying levels of creative content in various kinds of work. The following basic
conditions for creative work can be identified:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>The presence of uncertainty, or of a problem that can not be solved by
    known (by the would-be problem-solver, at least) methods</li>
  <li>The freedom to work without instruction as to when the work should be
    done, how, in what order, etc.</li>
  <li>The dependence of the results on the particular individual: his/her
    experience, intuition, will power, etc.</li>
  <li>The possibility of competing with someone (or with himself) to raise the
    level of achievement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Viewed in this way, a farmer working his land is doing creative work. Weather
conditions bring uncertainty. Crop yield depends on the farmer’s work - on his
hands and brain. It is up to him, to his intuition and experience, to take risks
- to decide when he should sow, how to care for the crops, when to harvest, and
so on. Likewise, the work of an engineer, manager, businessman, politician, etc.
is, at least in part, creative work.</p>
<p>It is possible to presume that creativity plays the same part as do vitamins:
a person needs only a small amount, but lacking them entirely leads to disease
and developmental problems. And as with vitamins, a lack of creativity is
especially dangerous for a young, growing person. Very often the importance of
being able to satisfy higher-level needs is underestimated. People often believe
that, if a person has a job and enough food and clothing he should be satisfied,
without understanding the reasons for boredom, cruelty, vandalism . . . We can
presume that unsatisfied needs demand a certain type of compensation, that an
individual unconsciously seeks revenge on society for his/her deprivation.</p>
<p>But why are all children, and far from all adults creative? Why are they
happy to work on creative problems and be able to solve them? Why does a child’s
natural curiosity turn into a powerful thirst for knowledge for one individual
and not another?</p>
<p>Everything depends on involving a person in education and creativity through
the psychological mechanism of engagement, based on alternating positive and
negative stimuli. It is similar to the mechanism of involvement in sports, in
collecting, in the need for glory and power, or for alcohol, drugs, etc.</p>
<p>This involvement begins when a child experiences pleasure in satisfying some
natural need. This, in turn, leads to the desire to increase the pleasure.
However, due to the human mechanism of habitual-ness, the level of pleasure
falls when the previous level of satisfaction is maintained. It therefore
becomes necessary to increase the “dose.” A positive feedback loop develops,
limited only by the physical potential of the individual.</p>
<p>It is possible to control the involvement in education through the human need
for creativity. If there is a creative component in education, it allows
victories to be achieved, a person’s self-esteem to be raised, and so on. This
is why children enjoy competitive games.</p>
<p>More often than not, children become involved in creativity by chance, under
the influence of a parent or enlightened teacher. Usually, however, only those
children who are somehow pre-disposed to creative work become involved. The
presence of the conditions necessary for this involvement is the first success.
What happens if there is no success? Success that is too-easily obtained does
not create strong feedback. Another important condition of involvement is the
difficulties that usually follow a first success and that must be overcome.
Excessive difficulty, however, can alienate a child and reduce his new-found
desire to study and create. How can the level of creative effort be regulated?
How can creative success be ensured?</p>
<p>These things are possible when the teacher is deliberately guided by the
child’s creative abilities, and with the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving
(TRIZ). TRIZ is a new science that allows creativity to be approached
systematically, providing the opportunity to teach any child to be creative and
to develop creative ability in any area of human activity.</p>
<b><font size="2">
<p>The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving and TRIZ Pedagogy</p>
</font></b>
<p>TRIZ was developed in Russia<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> by Genrich
Altshuller, a talented scientist and inventor, and his followers. Altshuller’s
work with TRIZ began in the 1940s and, to date, much experience in applying TRIZ
application to various areas of human activity has been amassed.</p>
<p>TRIZ is based on the study and application of the patterns of evolution of
various systems - technological machines, manufacturing processes, scientific
theories, organizations, works of art, and so on. Based on these patterns,
methods have been developed for searching for creative solutions. These methods
include three basic components:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>The logical analysis of a given system and its problems. This enables
    users of TRIZ to understand the essence of a problem and to reveal the
    non-obvious contradictions that hinder problem solving.</li>
  <li>The application of a special knowledge-base that includes the most
    effective methods of problem solving, along with examples of how these
    methods are used.</li>
  <li>The means to overcome psychological inertia in the process of problem
    solving.</li>
</ul>
<p>TRIZ enables users to perfect any system and to solve the overwhelming
majority of creative problems. But what is probably the very essence of TRIZ:
its use formulates a new way of thinking, one which is more logical, purposeful,
and creative. To date TRIZ has been applied to technology, science, medicine,
forecasting, preventing and eliminating emergency situations and various
undesirable phenomena (accidents, manufacturing defects, errors, crime, etc.),
managing people and organizations, business, and so on.</p>
<p>Experience in using TRIZ has shown that it develops certain useful
peculiarities in a TRIZ specialist’s way of thinking, such as:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>The need for creativity; an orientation toward searching for and solving
    creative problems in various areas</li>
  <li>The ability to apply creative methods and models in various areas (for
    example, a person takes a TRIZ course for solving technological problems,
    but ends up applying TRIZ methods toward solving family or management
    problems, etc.)</li>
  <li>The development of a new type of intuition based on the patterns of
    evolution</li>
  <li>The ability to quickly and effectively assimilate knowledge in new areas.
    This is especially noticeable with professional TRIZ specialists, who
    successfully generate creative solutions for customers in various areas of
    human activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Altshuller began teaching TRIZ to engineers in the 1960s. Soon afterwards it
became clear that it is impossible to teach creativity using traditional,
non-creative means. The basic ideas of TRIZ pedagogy (for teaching adults and
children) are as follows:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>The study of any subject as an evolving system</li>
  <li>The relationship between various subjects through the patterns of
    evolution of systems</li>
  <li>Teaching students to consciously apply creative problem-solving methods</li>
  <li>Teaching any subject via demonstration of the solving of creative problems</li>
  <li>Mastering the methods for overcoming psychological inertia.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the education of children, TRIZ pedagogy has an additional set of
objectives:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>The preservation and reinforcement of a child’s natural creative
    inclinations</li>
  <li>The formation of a creative, vital orientation toward the achievement of
    Great Goals</li>
  <li>The formation of a creative way of thinking (by means of the special
    course “Developing a creative imagination”)</li>
  <li>Mastering the TRIZ technique of quick learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>TRIZ pedagogy was created for the purpose of teaching TRIZ. In the early
1980s, however, the authors attempted for the first time to apply TRIZ methods
to teaching other scholastic subjects, first with physics and chemistry for
12-year-olds. This turned out to be very effective; students were very
successful in learning the course material. The experience has since been
extended by many other specialists, who have applied TRIZ to teaching nearly all
subjects for all age groups, from pre-school to the university level.</p>
<b><font size="2">
<p>How Can We Teach Creatively?</p>
</font></b>
<p>The principal premise of creative pedagogy is “learning should be fun.”
The joy of education is, for the most part, related to its creative nature, to
pleasure achieved through problem solving. This does not mean that all the
education should be creative only. It is quite possible to use the elements of
traditional pedagogy, “diluting” them from time to time with creative tasks.</p>
<p>The first steps in any education is the assimilation of new knowledge,
comparing it with existing knowledge and ideas, revealing and resolving
contradictions, determining the parts missing from the whole, verbalizing doubts
with the purpose of formulating questions, and so on. This is typical of the
creative process, and is what makes it so attractive. During the next stage of
education, the assimilation of new ideas gives way to memorization. This is a
non-creative process, however, even memorization can become more attractive by
incorporating, from time to time, elements of creativity.</p>
<p>In the process of human evolution the most powerful tool for creative
education - the game - was created. Games have all the components of creative
work stated above. A game provides the complex assimilation of various kinds of
knowledge, and develops practical skill, psychological skill, intellectual
skill, etc. Games are oriented toward training and the satisfaction of all basic
human needs. It is games that enable young children to assimilate the enormous
quantity of information necessary to orient them in their surroundings.</p>
<p>Art can be considered “play” for adults. One of the basic functions of
art is creative education by means of personal involvement in the process of
co-authorship. For example, when a person listens to music, he is constantly and
involuntarily playing a game: he is trying to guess what the next note will be;
when listening to poems he is guessing the following rhyme, and so on. A person
obtains his primary art education by perceiving (i.e., viewing, listening,
etc.); then obtains a more profound and well-rounded art education by attempting
to create his own (even poor) works of art.</p>
<p>Games have always been used as an auxiliary means of education. In the last
few decades, methods of education based on games, including computer games, have
become widely practiced.</p>
<p>All these are separate attempts to develop a system of complex education.
They have one general defect, however: the basic element - teaching a
methodology for creative searching - is missing. These attempts will never be
successful without it.</p>
<p>TRIZ education should become a kernel around which all these separate methods
can be unified. Consider the following example: the authors conducted a class
where several dozens of new, original kaleidoscopes were invented using TRIZ.
Kaleidoscopes were invented that had mobile elements, that used electrical,
chemical, and geometric effects, etc. Later, some calculation and design work
was performed together with the children. They were given detailed explanations
about optics, the rules of refraction in a lens, reflection in a mirror,
dispersion of light in a prism, certain mathematical concepts, and so on. When
conditions allowed, it would be possible to manufacture the kaleidoscopes they
had invented, to introduce the elements of mechanics, chemistry, and so on, to
work on a patent application for the kaleidoscopes. This would provide an
opportunity to acquaint children with the elements of patent law, and so on. A
TRIZ-coordinated system of tasks such as these could be created for various age
groups.</p>
<b><font size="2">
<p>A Child is an Inborn Creative Person</p>
</font></b>
<p>In the early 1980s the authors studied the classic work of Jean Piaget on the
peculiarities of a child’s way of thinking. We were astonished by the
analogies between a child’s thinking and the TRIZ way of thinking (see Table
1). A comparison of adults’, children’s, and the TRIZ way of thinking allows
us to draw a conclusion (not an original one; it has been widely discussed in
the world of pedagogy)<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> that any healthy child can
develop creative abilities in any area of human activity. When an adult studies
a foreign language, he can support it with knowledge of his native language, he
can draw an analogy, such as “der Tisch - the table,” and memorize the word.
But a child does not have such support; no one can explain to him/her what “table”
means. He must make his own creative generalizations to recognize what can be
called a table and what cannot. It is not yet been known how, i.e., by which
psychological and physiological mechanisms, this tremendous creative work is
performed, but only that they form the creative elements of a child’s
thinking. And it is not by a chance that these things are similar to the
mechanisms of TRIZ thinking, which have resulted from extensive research and
development.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these natural mechanisms of a creative child’s perception
almost completely disappear later in life. Some people - but only some -
preserve them to a greater or lesser degree. (It is not by mere chance that
creative abilities often coincide with infantilism.) There are various reasons
for this. On the one hand, the ability to speak makes it possible for a child to
use a new cognitive method - simply ask. On the other hand, this more effective
and economical, but less creative, way substitutes for the previous, creative
way.</p>
<p>A 5- to 8-year-old child begins to master logic; his/her thinking gradually
becomes more logical and less creative because the creative moment is
paralogical. It cannot easily be transferred to someone whose thinking is based
on logic. Language itself plays an important role in ousting creativity.
According to the theory of “linguistic relativity” developed in the thirties
in the United States by E. Sepir and B. Worf, the structure of language, to a
large degree, determines the structure of thinking and the cognitive way one
experiences one’s surroundings. All existing languages are based on classical
logic. They were created not for the purpose of creativity, but for normal
living.</p>
<p>The main reason, however, for the suppression of a child’s creative
abilities is most likely the absence of the conditions necessary for reinforcing
and developing these abilities, as well as the lack of creative stimulation on
the part of parents and teachers. Because it is responsible for public
tranquillity, society is instinctively afraid of children who are too creative.
Such children are unpredictable and often inclined to break tradition,
discipline, etc. They attempt to do everything their own way, require additional
attention, and so on.</p>
<p>The basic problem with the creative pedagogy of young children is mastering
the “adult” way of thinking - logic - while preserving the elements of the
child’s creative approach. In contrast, for adults and older children the
problem is to restore the lost creative thinking. TRIZ pedagogy has developed a
special means for implementing both of these tasks.</p>
<p>When forming a person’s creative needs and goals, one should bear in mind
that it can make the person’s life more complicated, can increase the level of
stress, and so on. Therefore, along with a means for stimulating creativity, the
“Vital Strategy of a Creative Person,” was developed - a kind of educational
course for developing activities for creative achievements, learning what
dangers a creative person is likely to meet, and how they can be overcome.</p>
<p>As a creative personality, a child is not a match for modern “mass”
pedagogy. French fashion designers consider the mop as the ideal female figure
because a designer can drape it however he/she desires. The conditions of “mass
pedagogy production” dictate standardization of the half-finished, as well as
the final, “product.” Individual characteristics and desires have been
neglected (if they do not hamper the processing) or fought against. If the
struggle does not yield results, the “half-finished product” is rejected in
some way.</p>
<p>Almost everyone who has attended a regular school can recall some kind of
student revolt against a teacher or against the educational system as a whole.
This is the instinctive fight of the individual against the inevitable
depersonalization of “mass pedagogic production.” Working with children of
various ages, the authors have become convinced that almost all of them have a
negative attitude toward the pedagogical methods of their parents or teachers.
They are sure that they know better how they should be brought up. A child’s
knowledge is limited, of course, but a child is capable of learning anything,
including the process of participating in his own upbringing.</p>
<p>Every person, to some degree, is a “self-made man.” Everyone to some
extent plans and directs his own life, “builds” himself. The trouble is that
in the majority of cases he does not know precisely what his goal is or how to
achieve it; he does not know himself and his surroundings. In such a case, a
creative teacher’s purpose is to convey to the student the idea of
self-perfection, and to help him achieve it. Creative pedagogy is an attempt to
replace the battle between teacher and student with the child’s struggle for
self-perfection. The teacher is the child’s assistant and ally in this
struggle.</p>

<p>What Should Future Creators be Taught?</p>
</font></b>
<p>This section of the article is not related to TRIZ pedagogy, but results from
the application of TRIZ to the problems of improving education.</p>
<p>The ever-increasing load that students must bear is usually explained by the
“information outburst” - by the enormous increase in the amount of
information regarded as necessary. In reality this “outburst” is provoked by
the accelerated development of methods of communication, which have outdistanced
our system of selecting and processing information. As a result, an individual
receives a tremendous amount of non-structured, often useless, information.
Often he/she is simply unable to use this information due to a lack of the
necessary knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>The majority of school curriculums are based on their creators’ personal
experiences and preferences; sometimes they are based on prejudices, such as
opinions regarding what knowledge a “man of culture” should possess.</p>
<p>It is necessary to develop a different approach to educational courses, based
on the specificity of information and knowledge:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Specific information: information that relates to specific problems. The
    average person faces such problems rarely, by chance only.</li>
  <li>Non-specific information: knowledge and skills that are widely used by the
    majority of people in various situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, reading skills and a knowledge of basic arithmetic are
non-specific skills, they are necessary for everyone. On the other hand, the
proof of the Pythagorean theorem, knowledge of the frog’s third eyelid, and
the name of the last ancient Roman emperor (Tarquili the Proud) are very
specific. Of the 200 people surveyed by the authors, not one of them could prove
the Pythagorean theorem and recall these facts or, at least, recall a situation
where a need for these things had arisen. All this knowledge, however, is
included in school curriculums<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It is impossible, of course, to divide all knowledge and information on the
basis of its specificity and the likelihood of its being needed in the future
without extensive research. It is clear, however, that much of what comprises
the curriculum in schools will turn out to be useless, and entirely new subjects
will be included in future curriculums. We can attempt to name some of them:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Information and skills necessary for survival, good health, and the
    ability to work. The elements of physical and psychological hygiene, sexual
    literacy, self-control, self-training (control of feelings, emotions, moods,
    reflexes, sleep, attention, ability to endure pain, and so on), self
    psychoanalytical skills, courage, self-restraint, self confidence, etc .
    Self protective skills, the ability to act appropriately in risky
    situations.</li>
  <li>Information and skills necessary for social life. Elements of psychology,
    communication skills, empathy. Elements of artistry, of the ability to talk
    and listen, to be convincing, to “read between the lines,” to
    distinguish truth from lies, to not submit automatically to suggestion, to
    overcome conformity. To be knowledgeable in the regularities of social
    functioning and evolution, basic laws, criminal and property qualifications,
    the basics of management, trade, business.</li>
  <li>Thinking skills. Logical, systematic approaches, formation of intuition
    and techniques for verbalizing rules, the ability to use abstract models,
    idealization, techniques for creative problem-solving, critical approaches,
    overcome psychological inertia, perform a probabilistic assessment, make
    decisions given unclear conditions.</li>
  <li>The ability to work with a knowledge base. Rapid reading and purposeful
    memorization, the ability to control one’s attention, to eliminate
    excessive information, to systemize it. Computer skills.</li>
  <li>Knowledge base. Profound knowledge of the environment - natural as well as
    technological. Knowledge of chemical, physical, and other effects that are
    encountered in the life of an average person. Understanding of basic
    scientific ideas, such as the theory of evolution, thermodynamics,
    mathematics, etc. Understanding of the basic ideas of the patterns of
    technological evolution and basic technologies. Understanding of the basic
    patterns of evolution of art, elementary skills in various kind of art.</li>
  <li>Manual labor skills; the ability to use simple tools. Ideas regarding
    various human specialties and activities (their merits and faults)
    sufficient for choosing a future profession.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of the knowledge and skills outlined above should be closely linked.</p>
