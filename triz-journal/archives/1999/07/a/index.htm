<blockquote>
  <p>The maturity of a technological system tends to evolve in a way analogous
  to that of any biological system. Technological systems go through stages
  comparable to pregnancy, birth, childhood, adolescence, maturity, and decline.&nbsp;
  This evolution is related as a function of time to four primary S-curve
  descriptors: the number of inventions in the field, the level of those
  inventions, the performance of the technology, and the profitability of the
  technology.&nbsp; Data pertaining to these descriptors can indicate the
  position of the technology on the main biological S-curve.&nbsp; From there,
  it is possible to predict how the technology will continue to evolve.&nbsp;
  This can be a valuable tool for those who make important decisions concerning
  the approach that should be used in the future such as whether to invest
  further in the technology or to focus on its successor.</p>
  <p>Such an analysis of technological maturity will be performed on the field
  of ultrasonic welding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  methods for obtaining the data as well as the results (S-curves) and analysis
  will be presented.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There will
  also be an examination of the possible future state of the technology and an
  assessment of likely technological management strategies as a result of the
  predicted technological evolution.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Ultrasonic Welding
Overview</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Ultrasonic
welding is used for joining materials (thermoplastics or metals) together in a
manner that is much quicker and safer than most traditional bonding methods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>High-frequency electrical energy is converted to high-frequency
mechanical energy and directed to the materials to be joined, which are secured
under pressure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The mechanical
energy, which is a vertical motion exceeding 15,000 cycles per second, is
transferred through a horn to the materials under pressure. This generates
frictional heat at the interface of the two materials, thus melting the
materials together in the desired region, where they solidify to a weld when
pressure and vibration cease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many
factors contribute to a successful weld, but it is imperative to have a correct
balance between amplitude of the vibration, time, and pressure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This technology is widely used in many industries with many different
metallic and thermoplastic materials.</span></p>
<h4>Mapping Technological Evolution</h4>
<h4><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:normal">The
position of a technological system on the biological S-curve can be gauged by
determining the position of the current technology on the four descriptor
S-curves; the number of inventions, level of inventiveness, profitability, and
performance (Fig.1).&nbsp;</span></h4>

</span>S-curve descriptors</span></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Data
were collected in order to create the three of the four descriptor curves in
Fig. 1 for the technology of ultrasonic welding.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<h5>Number of Inventions</h5>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img src="99jul_47.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_s1026" width="586" height="290"><br>

2</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Number of Ultrasonic Welding
Inventions From 1976 to 1998.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">A
patent search was performed to find inventions that pertain to ultrasonic
welding (or ultrasonic seaming, bonding, joining, etc.) and the development of
the technology both for it and its peripherals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The data for the number of patents was plotted and a second-order
polynomial fit was inserted (Fig.2).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
graph shows a gradual downward trend in the number of inventions over time, with
an increasing trend beginning in the early 1990’s.</span></p>
<h5>Level of inventiveness<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">The
level of inventiveness is determined by analyzing the patents found for their
respective inventive level, which ranges from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The grading criteria are located in the Appendix.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The field of ultrasonic welding began very high in level of
inventiveness, because it was a new concept in the field of materials joining.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>From there, it had other notable inventions, but over time, the overall
level of inventiveness decreased slowly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Recently,
inventions have hovered in the 1 and 2 level range, with most being simple
additions to the technology or adaptations that were made to accommodate use in
different areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The inventive
level data were determined by analysis of the above patents, and their plot is
shown in Fig. 3 with a second-order polynomial fit.</span></p>

<h5>Profitability</h5>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">To determine the profitability of ultrasonic
welding over time, given a lack of adequate financial data, an assumption was
used: the number of inventions that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">used</i>
ultrasonic welding (not the same ones used in the Number of Patents curve, which
improved ultrasonic welding technology) is proportional to the profitability of
the technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These data are
shown in Fig.4 with a second order polynomial fit insertion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The profitability increased significantly in the early 1990’s to
present.</p>

<h5>Data Analysis</h5>
<p class="MsoBodyText2">The next step in determining the position of ultrasonic
welding on the biological S-curve is comparing the experimental descriptor plots
to the predicted descriptor plots.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><u>Number of Inventions</u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="1.gif" width="319" height="206"><img border="0" src="2.gif" width="358" height="199">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">There
are two places on the predicted plot that could correspond to the experimental
data. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Further analysis by
correlation will show that the first is the correct region.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u>Level of Inventiveness</u></b></p>
<p><img border="0" src="3.gif" width="303" height="230"><img border="0" src="4.gif" width="410" height="203"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">There
are two places on the predicted plot that could correspond to the experimental
data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it is likely that
the second region corresponds because the first region begins to slope back up
at a level that the experimental data is already below.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Profitability</span></u><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="5.gif" width="276" height="206"><img border="0" src="6.gif" width="371" height="207"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">In
this comparison, there is a clear correlation between the highlighted regions on
the experimental curve and the predicted curve.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">From
the analysis of the three experimental descriptor curves, it can be seen that
there is a clear trend revealing the similar locations of ultrasonic welding
technology on three of the four descriptor curves, and the fourth can be
extrapolated.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="7.gif" width="165" height="345">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">These
data correspond to the following position on the biological S-curve:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="8.gif" width="177" height="136"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">This
curve along with the descriptor curves show that ultrasonic welding is about to
enter or is in the beginning of the maturity stage.</span></p>
<h5>Future State of Ultrasonic Welding</h5>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">This
field can look forward to a strong maturity stage.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Recently, much demand has arisen for this technology and it
is very likely that this trend will continue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ultrasonic welding is a versatile field with numerous possible
applications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Businesses would be
wise to direct resources toward this field to propel it into maturity and reap
the benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Eventually, like all
technological systems, ultrasonic welding will experience a decline as it exits
the maturity stage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At that point,
another breakthrough is likely to occur in the field of materials joining and a
new biological S-curve will begin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From
this analysis, however, don’t expect this to occur too soon.</span></p>
