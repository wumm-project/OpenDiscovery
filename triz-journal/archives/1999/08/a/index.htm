<p class="MsoBodyText2" align="left" style="text-align:left">The Separation
Principles from the TRIZ methodology can be used to deal with both technical and
non-technical problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Traditionally,
the separation principles (separation in time, space, upon condition, and
between parts and the whole) have been used to resolve difficult technical
problems with what appeared to be unresolvable contradictions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In a recent meeting of industry technical leaders, these principles were
used to attempt to generate new ideas to resolve some of the key paradoxes of
industrial innovation.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2" align="center">******</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of most significant of all the many problem-solving
principles and tools within the broad category of TRIZ is that of the Separation
Principles. These principles, separation in space, time, upon condition, and
between parts and the whole, are used extensively in analyzing and solving
technical problems that involve major contradictions in technical and physical
performance issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
principles, and the associated software algorithms available in TRIZ software
packages, are used daily to solve some of the most difficult technical problems.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Contradictions, however, occur in all facets of a business
operation, not just in its engineering and manufacturing functions. There is no
reason to think that these same Separation Principles cannot be applied to
&#8220;soft&#8221; or organizational type problems as well.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a recent group exercise with a group of corporate
managers, the Separation Principles were applied to a significant &#8220;soft&#8221; or
organizational problem facing many industrial organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is the problem of organizational response to the many contradictions
they see in trying to get an organization to be both responsive to short term
business needs and current customers, while at the same time being long term
stewards of the growth and profitability of the organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, how does an organization resolve the paradox of both
short term and long term needs, specifically within its technology organization?
How does it deal with the contradiction of innovation and current business
stewardship?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the preparatory discussions and meeting of this group, a
number of major paradoxes/contradictions that are faced in the area of corporate
innovation were discussed and summarized.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In a special TRIZ session following the generation of these
issues, a brief explanation of the Separation Principles was given and then the
group was asked to apply each of the Separation Principles, in turn, to each of
the contradictions and paradoxes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
exercise generated a significant number of new ideas for the group as well as
reinforced other ideas that the group had already considered and were
evaluating.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt">Each of these contradictions was
discussed in turn with the group, with the application of each of the
&#8220;standard&#8221; TRIZ separation principles being applied and the group creating
new ideas as a result of the discussions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What follows is a review and discussion of the process and
ideas generated.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The five major innovation paradoxes, discussed by the group
in their previous meeting, were as follows:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in">Somebody&#8217;s job vs. everyone&#8217;s job.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in">Inside business vs. outside business</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in">Chaos vs. discipline</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in">Passion vs. objectivity</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in">Risk vs. job security</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let us look at each of these in turn through the eyes of
the TRIZ separation principles.</p>
<h1>Somebody&#8217;s Job vs. Everyone&#8217;s Job</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">In many corporations, a small focused group of people, some
of whom are perceived to have &#8220;different&#8221; thinking habits, are assigned the
task of &#8220;innovating&#8221; while the bulk of the organization is left to take care
of the current business needs. Sometimes this distinction in assignment is based
on perceived creative ability and at other time based on technical background
and experience. This arbitrary segregation obviously shuts out the vast majority
of the organization&#8217;s intellectual assets from significantly contributing to
new and novel business and technical ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In can also send a subtle message throughout the organization that only
creative ideas from a few people are wanted.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In reviewing the four separation principles for application
to this paradox, the group discussed the following:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Time:<br>
Rotate responsibility for major innovation thought by time allocation.&nbsp; An
example of this is the now famous 15% allocation of time for independent
innovation projects by 3M researchers.&nbsp; All levels of management would
protect this &#8220;special&#8221; time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Space:<span style="mso-tab-count:1"><br>
</span>A room or special building is set aside for innovation activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Whenever a person or group is in this area, innovative thought and
activity is not only encouraged, but also required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hallmark, Armstrong, Lucent, and other organizations have practiced this
type of special room and facility separation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>These special facilities frequently have special resource materials, are
the sight of special training related to creativity and innovation, and are
specifically designed to facilitate the creative process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Condition:<br>
Simulated emergencies or crises are created by managers or scientists, requiring
the person or group to stop whatever routine task they are doing and to invent a
solution to a new problem, contact a new customer, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This could be the disclosure of a new patent, a new manufacturing
facility, a merger or acquisition, or some other business event that would
require a special innovative response from the organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In many organizations, these conditions come up naturally in the course
of business, but in many others, isolation from competition can create an
artificial complacency and emergencies may have to be artificially created.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Parts/Whole:<br>
In most large corporate projects there are always portions that can be
segregated out for special attention as far as innovation is concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>These can be portions projects that have unresolved technical
contradictions or unresolved business contradictions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This same type of separation can be done within the project groups
themselves, by assigning certain groups of people to focus on particularly tough
contradictory areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The rotation
of people in and out of these type of special groups is another version of the
same application of this separation principle.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">This
same concept can be applied within the context of what is normally considered to
be a routine project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A special
effort can be made to arbitrarily pick out a portion of such a project and try
to innovate in an area that was not thought of as having that potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Last
but not least, it is always possible to take any project and separate the work
process from the technical aspects of the project itself. Applying innovation
and creative thought to the work process can often yield as large a result as
the technical aspect of the project.</p>
<h1 style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Inside
Business vs. Outside Business</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Frequently,
major corporations are totally driven by the existence of long standing
businesses that generate cash flow, but not earnings growth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It can be difficult to make a transition from a low growth cash flow
business to a high growth, high margin, but short term negative cash flow
business. This can be especially difficult if different technical and business
skills are required for the new business area.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Applying
each of the separation principles to this particular problem can yield the
following possibilities:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Time:<span style="mso-tab-count:1"><br>
</span>Analyze in detail the product life cycle and initiate a defined,
separate, targeted innovation program designed to replace the current product at
a specified time. Another alternative is an acquisition strategy driven by the
projected time separations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Space:<span style="mso-tab-count:1"><br>
</span>Set up a totally separate physical organization to attack the current
market and customers from a totally different approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Condition:<br>
Use the top and bottoms of economic cycles to deliberately stimulate new
technical and business strategies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another
&#8220;condition&#8221; stimulus could be any number of artificially created
&#8220;crises&#8221;, including stock price, action of a competitor, or significant
change in a raw material cost or availability.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Parts/Whole:<br>
The use of internal venturing groups is commonly used in major corporations to
provide the stimulus to create a totally new business perspective.</p>
<h1 style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Chaos
vs. Discipline</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">When
an organization is well organized for current business conditions, it sometimes
takes some effort to artificially create chaos to cause the group in turn to
think outside the box of current operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The separation principles can be applied to address these issues as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There are times when a disciplined approach is required and others when a
rapid-fire, more chaotic approach is needed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Time:<br>
Separate innovation and disciplinary thinking in the course of new idea
development.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Recognize the need to separate new idea generation from
assessment when new ideas are generated.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Space:<br>
Use an outside meeting space, meeting with a totally new business contact, or
separate meeting location to allow the less disciplined approach to be
discussed.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Condition:<br>
At the appearance of a new client, new article, etc., the group is allowed to
brainstorm in an unstructured way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each
person can take it upon him/herself to initiate an ideation session after an
encounter with a new client, an unexpected outside phone call, a new magazine or
trade journal article, or some other appropriate triggering event.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Parts/Whole:<br>
A small group of people is separated from the group and assigned the job of
analyzing new areas in an unstructured way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Participation in this small group activity can also be varied with time
to ensure that broad organizational participation in innovation activities is
obtained.</p>
<h1 style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Passion
vs. Objectivity</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">In
the early days of a new idea, those proposing the new idea can generate
passionate thoughts and ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Sooner or later this enthusiasm must be combined with the
realities of business assessments, profit forecasting, realistic cost
projections, time to market, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Application
of separation principles to this contradiction can be as follows:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Time:<span style="mso-tab-count:1"><br>
</span>Identify passion cycle and negotiate specific time to be objective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bring in new thinking blood on a programmed basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Separate decision-making meetings between passion and objectivity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tools such as DeBono&#8217;s Six Hats methods can be useful in this regard.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Space:<br>
Separate idea generation meetings by location, and by personnel involved</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Condition:<br>
Separate behavior as a function of the idea generation from idea evaluation</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Parts/Whole:<br>
Separate reviews with objectives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Separate
reviews and analysis from idea generation and brainstorming</p>
<h1 style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Risk
vs. Job Security</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">With
the emphasis on short term profit growth and the pressure to never have a
failing product or business, people&#8217;s desire to risk their jobs to pursue new
and risky ideas is far less than in the past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Employees who have spent several years on a new venture team have found
themselves unemployed when the new venture technology was not viable or when the
underlying business assumptions go awry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
an organization has gone through a number of these kinds of risky new ventures
and personnel reductions have occurred, the remainder of the organization
becomes very &#8220;maize bright&#8221; and will cease to wish to become involved in
these sorts of high risk activities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Application
of separation principles to these issues can be as follows:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Time:<span style="mso-tab-count:1"><br>
</span>Identify seasoned, secure idea drivers whose confidence in their careers
minimizes risk concerns. Require all personnel to spend time in an innovative
centered position so that the risk is shared by all.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Space:<br>
All personnel are required to spend time at an innovation center, where there
are no penalties for &#8220;risky&#8221; ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
makes everyone more comfortable with the risk aspects of new ventures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>All personnel could be required to spend some project time away from the
safe political haven of &#8220;headquarters&#8221; to breed independent capability in a
broad cross section of the organization.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Condition:<br>
Special rewards are given to all product and process development teams who
generate significant new ideas outside their existing businesses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>These could include long term stock options that could not be cancelled
upon employment termination, minimizing the possibility of indiscriminate
downsizing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">Parts/Whole:<br>
A complete 360-degree feedback loop is implemented to insure that both
individuals and managers are involved in the process of decision and selection
of projects and personnel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">The
application of TRIZ Separation Principles to these issues presents some
interesting new ideas typically not practiced by most corporations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They would be extremely easy to try in most organizations with little
risk, and potentially provide a catalyst for innovation and growth.</p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Separation Principles within the TRIZ methodology have
proven themselves useful in solving thousands of highly challenging technical
problems over many decades.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
same principles can also be applied to the solution of many non-technical
problems as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We have only
begun to scratch the surface of the broader applications of these principles and
we hope that this short presentation will encourage others to evaluate the use
of these principles in other business and organizational contexts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Other possible application areas of separation principles
to &#8220;soft&#8221; organizational problems include:</p>
