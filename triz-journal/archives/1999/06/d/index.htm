<li>Introduction</li>
</u></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the old time, firefighters used their big moustaches to
filter smoke and their ungloved hands or ears to sense temperature. Today&#146;s
firefighters are equipped with special protective apparel which on one hand
protect them longer when exposed to a raging fire, but on the other hand,
prevent them from sensing the dangerous intense heat of a fire. The high tech
fabrics (like Nomex or Goretex) retain radiant heat until the gear is saturated.
At this point of no return firefighters start burning from the inside and have a
few seconds to quit their protective equipment. Temperature sensors now can
provide this lack of sensing information.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the current detection systems available on the
market have several flaws: weight, sensibility or accuracy and size. A sensor
plus a nine-volt battery and an alarm system are heavy. One unit does not
accurately reflect the temperature accumulation throughout the vest. Finally,
several detection units reduce the mobility of the firemen because of their
size. The purpose of this project is to identify if there are potential
improvements to these detection systems by using the Theory of Innovative
Problem Solving, also known as <b>TRIZ</b>. Several TRIZ tools will be used to
analyze this issue and to generate solutions: IFR, contradiction matrix,
separation principles, use of resources, ARIZ, 9 sub/super/system table,
maturity mapping. The solutions that are described could be the basis for a
doctoral research.</p>
<b><u>
<li>Background information</li>
</u></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Protective equipment has to have two features: <b>fire
resistant</b> and <b>water-resistant</b>. The first property sounds trivial when
the second may be more surprising. Water droplets can absorb a tremendous amount
of thermal energy. Heated water is volatile and can release explosive energy in
the form of dangerous steam. Water from sweat, hose streams or rains is trapped
in the gear and frequently causes burn injuries without warning. There are no
sensors available on fireman&#146;s jacket to detect inside moisture or super
heated steam formation.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another asset that could be added to a firefighter&#146;s jacket
is a <b>locator system</b>. Firefighters risk their lives when they get injured
and knocked down because of toxic fumes. The poor visibility associated with
stress and strain prevent their peers to find them if unconscious. Somehow,
there is an untold feeling of the fear to get hurt and not to be found. So far,
motionless sensors exist but are not widely used. The technology is based on
accelerometer sensors that send a signal to an alarm system when the person hasn&#146;t
move for a pre-determined amount of time.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, an efficient protective equipment should
include sensors that measure temperature, moisture level and send signals when a
motion or consciousness problem occurs.</p>
<b><u>
<li>Problem definition</li>
</ol>
</u></b>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such devices like temperature sensors and motion detection
  are already available on the market. Their main drawbacks are weight,
  affordability, size, reliability and lifetime. In addition, there are no
  moisture sensors inserted in the clothing layers to detect super heated steam.</p>
</blockquote>
</p><ul>
  <li>Is there a way to capture all information (temperature, moisture, and
    location) at the same time?</li>
  <li>What improvement could be made to the existing jacket without having to
    buy a new one?</li>
</ul>
<b>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The protective equipment should provide an accurate
  information, and should be reliable, lightweight, not expensive, not
  preventing the mobility of the fireman, washable and be optional when not
  necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
  <u>
  <li>Level of Innovation</li>
  </u></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a level 2 or 3 problem. The number of trials and
errors is probably less then 100, but there is a need for an essential
improvement of the existing system and the solution may be outside the box, in
another field of engineering. Most likely the solutions will influence the
science and be use in other areas such as patients with special needs or
astronaut&#146;s uniforms.</p>

</u></b>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main contradiction is:</p>
  </p><ul>
    <li>I want to detect an increase of temperature accurately. Therefore, more
      detection systems have to be installed on the jacket.</li>
  </ul>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the <b>Altshuller&#146;s 39 parameters</b>:</p>
  </p><ul>
    <li>The improving feature is an accurate information (#28)</li>
    <li>The degrading features are the weight of detection systems increases
      (several units on one jacket) (#2) and the volume of these detection
      systems that reduces the mobility (#7).</li>
  </ul>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contradiction matrix suggested solutions:</p>
  </p><ul>
    <li>28/2 = {28-35-25-26}</li>
    <li>28/7 = {32-13-6}</li>
  </ul>
  <u>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Analysis of the solutions:</p>
  </u><b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"># 28 a): Replacement of a mechanical system by an optical,
  acoustical or odor system.</p>
  </p><ul>
  </b>
  <li>Balloons with a metered pressure could explode under an increase of heat
    (thermal expansion principle). They could be programmed to explode
    exponentially in frequency, in reference to the temperature. At the
    beginning, there should be only a few &quot;pops&quot;, like one every 10<sup>o</sup>C
    increase. But after a given temperature, the balloons should pop up every 5<sup>o</sup>C
    indicating that a certain level is reached, and so on, up to a continuous
    popping sound. The secondary problem that arises is how to attach the
    balloons to the inside of the jacket? Would the sounds be loud enough to be
    heard? May be the special balloons tee shirt could be put on, under the
    jacket.</li>
  <li>Another solution is an optical display of the temperature inside the visor
    of the helmet. Instead of having an alarm that may increase the stress level
    of the fireman, the actual inside radiant temperature of his jacket could be
    displayed in his visor (science fiction movie like terminator, where the
    hero has all kind of information in front of his eyes). But these special
    helmet, also used by army pilots, are VERY expensive&#133;. But in the future,
    the technology may become more affordable and this solution may be viable.</li>
  <li>I can&#146;t imagine any odor system to be efficient because of the polluted
    environment. Although, it would be quite easy to have bulbs filled with gas
    that would also explode under an increase of pressure caused by the thermal
    expansion of gas. These bulbs would liberate some specific smells. But, it
    won&#146;t work because of the fumes.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"># 28 b): Use an electrical, magnetic or electromagnetic
  field for interaction with the object.</p>
  </p><ul>
  </b>
  <li>The power supply is the heavy part of the detection systems, so may be the
    jacket could have only one battery/alarm and several sensors in the jacket
    that would be wireless. The sensor could send the information to the central
    power unit. (See ARIZ for further details).</li>
  </ul>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"># 6 Universality of an object that performs multiple
  functions thereby eliminating the need for some other objects.</p>
  </p><ul>
  </b>
  <li>If all types of sensors are connected to the same power and alarm system
    then there is no need for three different detection systems. One system can
    combine any information given by one of the sensor and process the output.

</blockquote>
<ol start="7">
  <b><u>
  <li>Separation principles:</li>
  </ol>
  </u></b>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem could almost be stated as a <b>physical
  contradiction</b>:<br>
  I want an accurate information, but I don&#146;t want to carry it. I want a
  weight of a nonmoving object but I don&#146;t want it at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<b>
</p><ul>
  <li>The separation of time</b> means that sometime carrying the extra weight
  may be acceptable because of the great benefit of the information provided but
  other time the information may not be that important or critical while
  mobility, agility and speed (meaning light weight) may be the crucial factors.
  Unfortunately, firemen have one jacket for all duties. The innovative solution
  should take into consideration the flexibility to have or not to have the
  detection system if they want or not, depending upon external conditions.</li>
<b>
<li>The separation of space </b>means that the detection system could be divided
into several parts. Some of the heavy parts (alarm and battery) could be
displayed in such a way that they could be removed where as the sensors (light)
could be permanently sewn inside the jacket.</li>
</ul>
<b><u>Use of resources</u></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an obvious resource that is not used which is free
and plentiful: HEAT. The UFOZ showed that the battery was the heavy part and was
necessary to perform the useful function. May be heat could provide the power
supply for the alarm system. So as the heat increases inside the jacket, storing
radiant heat, some of this energy could be transformed into some useful electric
energy that rings the bell. In that case, the higher the temperature, the more
energy is transformed and the more audible the sound warning system is. The
harmful effect is transformed into a useful function.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem is to find the phenomenon or physical principle
effect that could do it. TechOptimzer, from Invention Machine should help to
find this phenomenon.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So the number of TDS increases but it is essential to
  introduce an X-resource, which prevents an increase of weight (Harmful
  Function), while performing the Useful Function: accurate detection. In other
  words, an increase of TDS should provide an increase of sensors (useful tool)
  to enhance the detection (useful function), but the harmful tool should be
  reduced to the minimum: one or no batteries/alarms systems. <u>Wireless
  sensors</u> may be the solution. The sensors are placed on the jacket
  virtually weightless and emit a signal. A central unit made of a battery and
  an alarm system will warn the fireman of an increase of temperature.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second approach to the problem is to introduce the
  X-Resource that provides 100% of the detection with one battery/alarm

  <li>Maturity mapping and patent research</li>
  </u></b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several patents were available in the literature. The IBM
  search engine references patents from 1970&#146;s and after. The first patent is
  an hyperlink connected to the IBM search engine. The research was organized
  upon four axes: 1) sensors (temperature, motion and moisture) used in
  garments, 2) temperature and sensors used in the medical field, 3) garments
  made of special fabrics or special structures that should be used, and 4)
  cooling system in garments. Level 3 problems look at other fields to solve
  problems and monitoring patients temperature is very close to monitoring
  temperature of a fireman vest. All patents are in Appendix 2, with some
  highlights. Some of the solutions presented are greatly inspired from these
  patents. Therefore, they will be referenced.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are only a few patents on this topic. Although it&#146;s
  a great idea, it was not successful commercially. This cooling principle could
  be used as a GREAT-MAJOR breakthrough improvement for firemen. At this point
  of no return when the garment as stored so much radiant heat that it can&#146;t
  take it anymore, a trigger could be set to free some dry ice and therefore
  give an extra time for the firemen to run away. Dry ice is very light and
  quite inexpensive.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trigger could be made of heat shrinkable material (US
  4814766 and US4520352). They are thermoplastic film tapes that have a
  substantial drop in tensile strength at a given temperature. The dry ice could
  be stored in a bag closed by these heat shrinkable tapes. As the temperature
  reaches a critical point, the tape breaks and releases the dry ice into the
  layers of the jaclet. Storage would be a secondary problem that would need to
  be addressed.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Conclusion on TRIZ:</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></u>I learned a new way of thinking. I was proven that I don&#146;t
have to jump and accept my own quick solutions because TRIZ will bring me, in a
systematic way, to the solutions I could have found by myself AND in addition
will give me new ones.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I found ARIZ to be exhaustive and long for a simple technical
contradiction. The contradiction matrix is powerful enough to give a good set of
solutions.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In regards to this project, I have to admit that I had
pre-guessed some improvements but not all of them. For example, the
contradiction matrix suggested &quot;solution 28 a: replace the system by an
acoustic, optical or odor system&quot;. That&#146;s how the popping balloons came
to my mind. The patent research definitely gave me a lot of ideas for
improvements. I gained some knowledge in the crystal liquid principle widely
used in medical area but absolutely ignored in protective apparel. It&#146;s cheap,
reliable, exists since the 70&#146;s and is clearly at a mature stage. So why is it
ignored? Through the patent search, I also discovered that cooling vests already
exist for burnt patients since 1975. Why isn&#146;t used for protective apparel?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ taught me to look outside the box and convinced me that
my solution is already somewhere else, in another area. In the future, I&#146;ll
use TRIZ in my professional technical problems.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I&#146;m thankful that I was a part of this class and I wish you
good luck for your center and development of this theory in the United States.</p>
