<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In today&#146;s business world, successful companies must stand
their ground in an extremely competitive environment and must constantly adapt
their products to new market demands. At the same time the lifecycle of many
products has considerably decreased. If the product has a<font COLOR="#ff0000"> </font>long<font COLOR="#00ff00">
</font>pay-off period the enterprise has very little time to make the desired
profits. At the time of entering the market, any quality deficits could cause
failure and push the enterprise into severe financial crises.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image8.gif" width="352" height="229"></p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To operate successfully within the area of conflict between
cost, deadline and quality, it is not sufficient that all persons involved are
aware of this difficulty. Efficient tools allowing a constant fine tuning of the
development process must be available to the team. Any product deficits that
could cause customer complaints must be eliminated during the development phase
as far as possible. Failure detection and failure management are not the
customers&#146; job but must be carried out by the development engineers. To
elucidate the strategic importance of such preventive quality planning in early
product development phases, some especially relevant examples will be
illustrated. Quality must be developed into the product from the very concept.
This increases the expenditure at an early stage of the project but ensures that
in consequence neither time nor money for the realization of second-or
third-class concepts is wasted. The following graphic shows that up to 75% of
all mistakes occur in the development stage. For the most part they are
eliminated in the production-or testing phase. In particularly disadvantageous
cases the faults are only detected by the customers.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image9.gif" width="490" height="359"></p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One example for this is the callback of the new Opel Astra
(Europe, Nov 1998). It was triggered off by consumers&#146; complaints about
scraping<font COLOR="#ff0000"> </font>noises at steering, which &#150; according to
the company&#146;s information &#150; had been caused by tolerance defaults. Late
fault management becomes especially perilous<sup> </sup>when the costs necessary
for failure correction are examined. Opel sent 150.000 models to the service
station for a half hour inspection. Assuming an hourly rate of 600 ATS, a damage
of 45 million ATS is incurred merely from garage stays. For that amount of money
1125 development engineers could calculate tolerance for a whole week. Loss of
image and other financial damage are not even taken into consideration in this
calculation.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Methodical problem solving</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the development of profitable products it is essential to
systematically identify all conceivable problems and potential deficiencies. For
that, various methods were worked out to assist the engineer in doing his
difficult job. Such, the development process can be effectively supported
through adequate methods and tools. In practice it has proved a success to
consult experienced moderators who make it possible for the diverse development
steps to proceed in a coordinated fashion within an interdisciplinary team.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To all these methods the same rule applies: they must not
occur as ends in themselves. There is always a danger that the research team
makes it its business to fully complete the given forms and graphics. If the
project is backed up with simple calculations, the impression of a
scientifically accurate computation arises. It must be the moderator&#146;s job to
push the applied method as far as possible into the background and use it merely
as a guide and guiding data for his further procedure in problem search. The
intellectual potential doesn&#146;t lie in completing forms but rather in
discussion and discourse which are necessary to acquire information and must
take place within the development team.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The diverse tools accordingly constitute neither new nor
additional assignments for the engineers, but help all members of the team to
systematically and orderly conduct those tasks which are to be carried out for a
successful implementation of the project. Only by such systematic work can the
development process be controlled and continually developed.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This contribution exemplary sketches how, starting from the
consumer&#146;s demands, innovative products can be systematically developed.
Besides it shows how the diverse product parameters are harmonized in an optimal
way. The following illustration of a mouse-trap shows how TRIZ can work for the
development procedure.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Realizing customer demands</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is inevitable for the realization of efficacious products
that the customer demands are identified and understood. Therefore those people
who must later process the consumers&#146; information should be tied up in the
procurement of information from the very start. After all they know best what
kind of information is essential for developing new products. It is the only way
to ensure that by the time of project launch all compulsory data is available
and the staff<sup> </sup>members accept this information. For the registration
of customer requests diverse information channels can be tapped:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the development team&#146;s task to translate customer
demands into actual product characteristics. This performance can be assisted by
QFD. The QFD is accomplished in interdisciplinary teams, which guarantees the
integration of all concerned departments from the beginning. Intense discussions
occasion all project members to think about what the product must look like to
transform customer demands as good as possible.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must also be noted that the consumer requests meet the
current situation. The KANO &#150; model shows how those product characteristics
that enthuse the customer today will tomorrow be taken for granted.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When constructing a mouse-trap that meets all customer
demands it appears that some parameters affect each other negatively. E.g. the
customers want the trap to be safe in handling and quick in killing the mouse.
To kill the mouse immediately the trap needs as much striking force as possible.
But an increase in drive also raises potential hand injuries.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So there are two customer demands &quot;safe for
fingers&quot; and &quot;kill immediately&quot; which are hardly compatible. The
ranking indicates, though, that the realization of both requirements is of high
relevance to the customer. At the same time the QFD shows how our competitors
are rated and maybe we realize we must improve. The calculated ranking of the
separate technical parameters signals that the striking force is of high
significance to the product.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main question for the development team is: &quot;How do
we produce a mouse trap which kills quickly and is at the same time safe for the
user?&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This simple example illustrates that the QFD comes in handy
to identify problems. Its main advantage is that a direct correlation between
the identified problem and the customer demands can be established. The question
whether a problem is relevant to the consumer can clearly be answered.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Developing innovative solutions</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ for the first time enables development engineers to
systematically solve the identified problems. This enlarges the expenditure for
the development of new concepts, but it also ensures that all potential solution
possibilities are taken into consideration. Hence the best concept will be
realized. TRIZ consists of several different tools that can be used to solve
technical problems. There is no fixed order which must be followed in the
problem solving process. Rather, the TRIZ users&#146; knowledge and experience
direct what tools are to be used in connection with the particular problem.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the above example the problem was handled with the
&quot;40 principles&quot; to solve technical conflicts. A conflict is given when
the improvement of one parameter leads to deterioration of another parameter. In
our case, the &quot;user friendliness&quot; decreases as the &quot;striking
force&quot; increases. For this conflict TRIZ offers so called solving
principles that can be drawn from the conflict-matrix. For our problem following
principles were set out:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>grouping/ segmentation (1)</li>
  <li>Replace mechanical systems (28)</li>
  <li>Local characteristic (3)</li>
  <li>Self-sufficiency (25)</li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each of these principles must be worked over to develop
adequate concepts.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<i><u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Segmentation</p>
</u></i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ suggests, e.g., to apply the
&quot;grouping/segmentation&quot; principle to the mouse-trap. It advises to
split the trap into several parts. This means as follows: a special holding
device is constructed which cuts out the risk of finger injury during the
commissioning of the trap<font COLOR="#ff0000">. </font>Is the trap ready, it is
set and the holding device is removed. A further principle is the replacement of
mechanical systems with an optical, acoustic, or electric field. In the
mouse-trap example, electroshock could serve as a substitute for the mechanic
guillotine in killing the mouse.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All solution possibilities given by TRIZ must be examined
step by step, till all imaginable solution concepts are elaborated. If the
acquired solutions are non-satisfactory, further TRIZ tools must be applied. The
preceding QFD guarantees that those problems which hinder the realization of
customer demands are treated first.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Technical evolution</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To not only satisfy the customers but also enthuse them with
product innovations it is not enough to simply fulfill the set demands. TRIZ
offers the possibility to simulate future developments of technical systems. The
basis for this is the classical s-curve model. Previous experience was used to
derive laws of evolution of technical systems. By means of these laws scenarios
on how the mouse-trap will further be developed can be worked out. TRIZ promotes
the system evolution but nobody knows how big the market will be and when the
product will have reached the forecast development stage. That requires the
methods and techniques of modern marketing. Yet it is of great advantage to many
companies to predict what the future product, fulfilling the same functions as
the already existent product, might look like. The development of new product
concepts by means of these regulations of dynamism can be illustrated by the
following example. [Source: TechOptimizer&#153;]</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here is a list of the mouse trap concepts that these examples
of the technology forecasting pattern of &quot;Flexibility&quot; suggest. The
basic function of the mousetrap is &quot;killing the mouse&quot;. This function
is performed by the guillotine:</p>

</div>
</font><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subversive failure analysis</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After deciding in favor of one distinct solution concept all
conceivable shortcomings that occur with the realization must be given thought.
For that, an FMEA can be made. The potential shortcomings are assigned to the
corresponding causes of fault. TRIZ assists this search for causes of fault by
means of the so-called &quot;subversive failure analysis&quot;. Here a little
trick is used.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The potential deficiency is defined as desired event. This is
to be attained by means as simple as possible.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A potential weakness in the mouse-trap case could be that the
mouse gets the bait without setting off the trap. To eliminate this deficiency
it is essential to know all causes for the failure. How does the mouse manage to
steal the cheese? For subversive failure analysis the problem must be inverted.
The idea is formed that the mouse-trap holds a valuable diamond instead of
cheese. The task now is to get the diamond without triggering the trap off.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="center"><img SRC="Image13.gif" width="323" height="214"></p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is one problem like many others. TRIZ is a means to
reach for solutions. Each solution found constitutes a potential cause for
failure.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the mouse trap there could be the following solutions:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>the mouse can touch the mousetrap in such a way that the trigger is
    activated, but the mouse itself is not in the &quot;right&quot; position.</li>
  <li>the mouse fixes the mousetrap with one of it&#146;s paws so that the bait can&#146;t
    move down.</li>
  <li>the mouse waits until corrosion fixes the mousetrap...</li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With all potential failures to the developed concept
identified and eliminated, the optimization of the product parameters should be
carried out prior to series production. Especially with substantial changes at
the product the risk of unwelcome side-effects which were not sufficiently
reflected occurs.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Optimizing solution concepts</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mouse-trap example shows how optimization can be achieved
by simple means. In the past, more or less complicated mathematical methods were
developed that had to be applied to this problem. Nowadays, practical industry
solutions developed, which replace statistics by graphs to a great extent. Now,
even &quot;non-statisticians&quot; can apply these optimizing processes. Simple
calculations on mean and mean variation are sufficient to achieve good results.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thereby, main effects and interaction effects are
distinguished. Main effects indicate how changes of separate parameters
influence the result. One examination could for instance be the effect of 2
differing sorts of bait on the amount of mice caught. To optimize the parameters
it is especially significant to consider not only the main effects but also the
corresponding interactions between the parameters. An interaction for two
factors is given when one factor&#146;s influence on the target size depends on the
adjustment of other factors. In the above example this means that along with the
optimization of the length of the guillotine it is necessary to consider the
spring strength used and the size of the base-plate.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For this the development team works out those parameters that
are being optimized in the course of test planning. In the mentioned case
following 4 factors were chosen:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Length of guillotine</li>
  <li>Spring strength</li>
  <li>Bait</li>
  <li>Base-plate</li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For each of these parameters two levels were determined which
served the parameter optimizing.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this case 8 tests were done. The last column shows the
number of mice caught for each combination of parameters. This chart can easily
be analyzed graphically.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To find out whether bacon or cheese is more suitable to catch
mice, following calculation must be accomplished.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sum of all K (13) divided by the number of tests (4)
amounts to the average number of mice caught with cheese (3.25). Then, the
average number of mice caught with bacon is calculated and entered to the
diagram. Next, the two points are connected. In the above case an average of
3.25 mice were caught with cheese and 3.75 with bacon. Bacon is the better bait
to catch mice.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image14.gif" width="288" height="270"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To enable the consideration of the interaction between
parameters they must be converted into a graphic as well. The calculation
pattern is exactly the same as before. To work out point F+B+, the average for
caught mice is formed from the respective combinations of parameters. The
average (3.5) of test 1 and 2 is computed.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concerning the relation between guillotine and spring
strength the diagram clarifies that with a long guillotine the springiness doesn&#146;t
affect the number of caught mice, whereas in combination with a short guillotine
more strength is advantageous. The graphic of all parameters and their
interaction allows a fast and simple analysis of the series of tests. In the
above example the decision was made in favor of long guillotine, high spring
strength and base-plate B. Bacon is the preferable bait.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this way, all other parameters of the mouse-trap can be
evaluated. This process leads to optimal performance of the mouse-trap even
before series production starts. It might happen, of course, that new problems
occur with the test run. These problems must again be properly described and
consequently worked on by TRIZ.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Summary</p>
</font></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be the aim of any product development to meet
customer demands in an optimal way and, if so possible, exceed consumer
expectations by means of product innovations. Only with such innovations a
company can achieve profit on the market in the long term.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having innovative ideas is not enough, though. They must also
be converted into new products suitable for customers. It is to be considered
that with a great amount of changes there is a risk to get new, so far unknown
failures.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Merely by systematic failure finding deficiencies can be
identified and eliminated in time. All members of the team must bear in mind
that the major part of failures occur in the early development phase and their
elimination at a later project phase causes enormous costs.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ helps development engineers to overcome psychological
barriers in the concept phase. It is here that the course must be set and the
most promising way must be found. Once traveling a mediocre way, even with
highest efforts the project&#146;s success can only slightly be increase</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With TRIZ, though, all imaginable ways for the solution of a
problem are surveyed. The development engineer obtains a complete map of all
possible paths of solutions. The team must decide in collaboration with the
distinct experts which way is the favorable one for the company. Even if at
first glance it seems as if it were impossible to let a creative process run
systematic or software supported, a closer examination shows that TRIZ forces
the development engineers to exactly define the problem and deal with all areas
of solution. TRIZ cannot generate a solution, but it leads to specific
formulations of questions, and makes the team find suitable answers to these
specific questions. This means for TRIZ users:</p>
