<p>Introduction</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Arial">
<p>TRIZ offers a wide-ranging series of tools and methods to help designers and
inventors to solve problems in creative and powerful ways. For the most part
these methods have evolved independent and separate from many of the design
strategies developed outside Russia.</p>
<p>TRIZ-based research work taking place at the University of Bath includes
activities to compare and contrast TRIZ with some of these non-TRIZ
methodologies. Our aim is to produce tools and techniques which will coherently
combine the best features of each method.</p>
<p>This article focuses on Nam Suh&#146;s Axiomatic Design (AD) ideas and their
possible relationship with TRIZ; firstly from the perspective of how TRIZ might
benefit designers more accustomed to AD methods, and then looking more closely
at how Axiomatic Design might be usefully applied within a TRIZ context.</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Introduction To Axiomatic Design</p>
</b>
<p>Professor Nam Suh at MIT has published widely on the subject of design.
Probably his seminal work remains 'The Principles of Design' (Reference 1),
published in 1990. The bulk of that textbook discusses his Axiomatic design
approach. The approach is primarily concerned with the establishment and
deployment of means of determining whether a solution to a given design problem
is 'good' or 'bad'.</p>
<p>The approach is built around two axioms:-</p>
<blockquote>
  <b>
  <p>Axiom 1 - 'The Independence Axiom' </b>- In which it is stated that 'good'
  design occurs when the Functional Requirements (FRs) of the design are
  independent of each other.</p>
  <b>
  <p>Axiom 2 - 'The Information Axiom'</b> - In which 'good' design is defined
  by achievement of a minimum 'information' content (or. to grossly
  over-simplify the Axiom, good design corresponds to minimum complexity).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In essence, the two axioms are analytical in nature. Suh uses a feedback
control loop analogy in describing the design process (Figure 1). Given a set of
input conditions, &#145;societal needs&#146;, and a desired output - the product,
prototype or process - the analogy indicates the presence of a black box &#145;ideate
and create&#146; synthesis capability - through which a designer somehow generates
a candidate design solution based on the inputs. The two Axioms are then used as
analytical tests (i.e. the feedback part of the analogy) of how 'good' the
synthesised solution is.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1: Schematic of Design Process (based on (1), Fig 3.10)</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following sections explore some of the compatibilities and contradictions
between Suh's <b>analytical</b> design Axioms and the powerful design solution-<b>generating</b>
capabilities of TRIZ using design examples from The Principles of Design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>A Simple Example - Reduction of Materials Cost</p>
</b>
<p>Suh discusses the case of a major US instrument maker looking to reduce the
cost of the impact-grade polystyrene it used each year (Reference 1, pp30-31).
Seeing that material cost for the parts under consideration constituted 75% of
the manufacturing cost, Suh describes how the R&amp;D team at the company was
asked to devise a means of reducing cost of materials by 20% without sacrificing
the mechanical properties of the part.</p>
<p>As in the large majority of other approaches, Suh also sees problem
definition as the key to achievement of successful design (see also freezer
design example later in this article). In Suh's terms, problem definition is an
iterative process centred on the definition and optimisation of the Functional
Requirements of a design.</p>
<p>In the case in question, Suh derives two FRs:-</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>FR1 = reduce the material cost by 20%<br>
  (i.e. reduce the material usage by 20%)</p>
  <p>FR2 = toughness of the plastic part to equal or exceed that of the original
  part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of synthesising possible solutions to the problem, Suh offers little
in his book to detail how the &#145;ideate and create&#146; black box derived viable
solutions other than by stating that the designers tried a few different ideas
(e.g. 'insert fillers', insert very small fillers') and eventually came up with
the idea of 'microvoids'. The description in the book very much implies that the
&#145;process&#146; of discovering the solution was a somewhat nebulous and protracted
affair.</p>
<p>At this point, then, it is very interesting to introduce how TRIZ might have
been usefully deployed in reaching such a design solution:-</p>
<p><b>Contradictions</b> - the problem of how to reduce the amount of material
being used, while maintaining strength should hopefully immediately suggest a
design contradiction and hence the use of the Contradiction Matrix. The Matrix
suggests &#145;Parameter Change&#146;, &#145;Curvature Increase&#146; and &#145;Preliminary
Action&#146; as means used by others to inventively solve this QUANTITY OF
SUBSTANCE versus STRENGTH technical contradiction. The first two suggestions in
particular point immediately to a void-based solution (e.g. &#145;curvature
increase should suggest the idea of making &#145;bubbles&#146;/voids in the material
smaller).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Evolutionary Trends</b> - even more encouraging is the 'space
segmentation' evolution trend spotted by Altshuller and his team - Figure 2 -
i.e. a trend in which voids are introduced into a structure in ever smaller
fashion:</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial"><img SRC="Image2.gif" width="640" height="116"><br>
</font>Figure 2: Altshuller&#146;s &#145;Space Segmentation&#146; Evolution Trend<br>
(figure based on TechOptimizer output)</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>In both instances, TRIZ has vividly replaced the somewhat nebulous ideation
stage in the Suh description with a systematic solution synthesis.</p>
<p>Once derived, Suh demonstrates (albeit extremely briefly) how the Axioms may
be used to determine that the microvoids solution is a good one and, perhaps
more importantly (in Chapter 6) how the axiomatic approach may be used to
quantitatively establish the most appropriate size and volume fraction of
microvoids for the detailed, final solution. In this way, Suh&#146;s approach may
be seen to be complementary to TRIZ: TRIZ equals synthesis tool, Axiomatic
design equals analytical tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>The Wright Brothers and Freezer Doors</p>
<p></b>Problem definition is everything. According to Suh, the key to successful
problem definition is the formulation and minimisation of Functional
Requirements. He cites birds' wings as an example. Birds' wings have to satisfy
many FRs; vertical take-off, horizontal take-off, climb, dive, cruise, hover,
pitch, yaw, roll, retract, provide thermal insulation, etc. Initial human
attempts at flight looked to mimic the bird wing design. They failed to
recognise that not all of the bird wing FRs were required to achieve flight and
hence they failed to fly. Suh suggests that the genius of the Wright brothers
was in minimising the number of FRs to only those necessary for near-horizontal
take-off, slow cruise speed and limited need for change in direction.</p>
<p>In many senses, this minimization of FRs is a solid test of 'good' design. It
is however not the whole story. It is not the whole story for two important
reasons:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;1) It fails to recognise evolutionary trend towards increasing &#145;value&#146;
or &#145;ideality&#146; (Miles, Reference 2); minimising the number of FRs might be
the only way to achieve <i>any </i>form of solution &#150; as was the case with the
Wright brothers - but as capability increases, so we will seek to introduce more
FRs in order to increase customer 'value'. For example, sticking with the case
of wing design, think of the evolution from the Wright brothers effectively
fixed wing (i.e. their use of &#145;wing-warp&#146; was (understandably) crude), to
simple flaps, to complex multi-flap designs, to swing wing aircraft, to smart
structures, etc (NB note also the 'Dynamisation' evolution trend &#150; Figure 3.)</p>

</font>Figure 3: Altshuller&#146;s &#145;Dynamisation&#146; Evolution Trend<br>
(figure based on TechOptimizer output)</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>2) It fails to recognise the 'delight' aspects when a customer buys a product
to do</p>
<p>one thing and later finds out it can also do something else as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When we reduce the FRs to a minimum (or simply define them
inappropriately) - as in Suh's example of freezer door design; where the
Requirements are reduced to 1) minimise energy (cold air) loss, and, 2) provide
good access - we may well actually be shutting ourselves off from a significant
sector of the actual customer base.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

</font>Figure 4: Nam Suh&#146;s &#145;Bad Design&#146; Freezer</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>Of course, the freezer design case cited by Suh is merely used as a
convenient demonstration of his idea of Functional Requirements. In the real
world of very high levels of competition and consumer choice, however, when he
describes the vertical hinged door as &#145;bad design&#146; because it does not meet
his FRs, he is failing to recognise that they actually might well not be the
most important requirements. Or that a very large proportion of freezers sold
are of the vertically hinged variety.</p>
<p>The &#145;customer delight&#146; aspect is also interesting. &quot;Good design is
about giving customers what they want. Great design is about giving customers
what they didn&#146;t expect&quot; to quote Tom Peters (3). A great example of a
product which turned out to offer customers something they did not expect is the
AV-8B (Harrier) vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. The Harrier was
&#150;and, thirty years later, still is &#150; a great aircraft. At least a small part
of its longevity is due to the realisation some considerable time into it&#146;s
service life that if pilots used the swivelling nozzles during flight (as well
as for the initially designed vertical-to-horizontal flight transition
functional requirement), they were able to produce manoeuvres capable of
defeating just about any kind of enemy threat: &#145;Vectoring In Flight&#146; &#150;
VIFing &#150; an unexpected additional functional capability.</p>
<p>Problem definition continues to be the single greatest challenge facing
designers. The TRIZ &#145;Ideal Final Result&#146; philosophy (References 4 and 5) is
perhaps one of the more effective and practical methods available, although, as
we shall see later, the appropriate definition of FRs can offer new problem
solving insights in certain regards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Wheel-Covers</p>
</b>
<p>The Suh book contains many examples of use of the Axiomatic design analysis
approach. While the main purpose of the examples is to demonstrate the
underlying principles of the AD methods, they, unfortunately, do not always
demonstrate his stated belief in the importance of effective problem definition.
The example of the wheel-cover design (pp289-93) is one such case. More
interesting than simply providing a demonstration of how the axiomatic approach
may be used to find a good ('right') answer to the wrong question, however, is
the role it might help to play in highlighting both the power inherent in the
TRIZ methodology and the future potential for integration between the two
approaches.</p>
<p>The example comes from work done at General Motors. Back in the early 80s,
the book records, the designers at GM had a problem with wheel covers. GM wheel
covers at the time were held on by simple spring clips. The problem the
designers faced was that, if spring force was too small, the wheel covers fell
off, and, if the spring force was too high, vehicle owners found it difficult to
remove the cover when a wheel change was required. Suh&#146;s book describes the
high degree of scientific rigour and customer focus employed by the GM designers
during the search for a problem solution: They conducted a series of
sophisticated customer trials using wheel covers with different spring forces
and systematically measured how satisfied the customers were with each of the
different cases. The results are summarised in Figure 5. Very simply, they found
that 100% of customers were satisfied from the perspective of ease of cover
removal if the force required to remove the cover was 30N or less, and that 100%
of customers were happy that their wheel-covers wouldn&#146;t fall off if the
retention force was 35N or more.</p>
<p align="center"><img SRC="Image5.gif" width="476" height="277"><br>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Figure 5: Wheel Cover Retention Force Design
Point Selection</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>As well as being customer focused scientists, the GM designers are also shown
in the book to be very much cast in the non-TRIZ &#145;design is a trade-off&#146;
mind-set. Given the customer data, the &#145;design-is-a-trade-off&#146; mindset says
that the &#145;optimum&#146; spring retention force needed to be somewhere between 30
and 35N. Being scientists, they also recognised that mass-production would mean
some statistical variation in the achievable spring force. The Functional
Requirement for the wheel cover spring design, therefore, became &#145;<i>Provide a
retention force of 34±4N</i>&#146;.</p>
<p>In non-TRIZ terms, they had done the best they could. In effect they had come
up with a solution which was &#145;optimum&#146; because it dis-satisfied the minimum
number of customers. In fact, their data had shown that a 34±4N solution would
dis-satisfy somewhere between 2 and 6% of their customers. Or, put another way,
probably somewhere around 100,000 per year.</p>
<p>Suh&#146;s analysis of the problem is subsequently somewhat complex, but
nevertheless shows how the axiomatic approach was able to best tune the design
variables to achieve the defined Functional Requirements.</p>
<p>TRIZ, on the other hand, would immediately identify the GM wheelcover problem
as a design contradiction. The TRIZ approach is built on a &#145;design without
compromise&#146; philosophy. It is about eliminating contradictions rather than
accommodating them. The contradiction present in the wheelcover case is a
Physical Contradiction. It is a physical contradiction because the wheelcover
retention force is required to be be HIGH (to retain the cover) AND LOW (to make
it easy to remove). Altshuller and his team&#146;s analysis of the patent database
has allowed us to see how inventors across all industries and specialities have
successfully eliminated such contradictions. A very good summary of principles
for eliminating Physical Contradictions may be found in Reference 6 (page 176).
The wheelcover example quickly reveals itself to be a physical contradiction in
which we might seek to separate the contradictory requirements in TIME &#150; i.e.
we would like the retention force to be HIGH when the car is in motion, and LOW
when the car is stationary. Specific TRIZ Inventive Principles, then,
recommended to solve problems of the wheelcover &#145;separation in time&#146; type,
include:-</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>&#145;Preliminary Action&#146; (e.g. push-and-twist type wheel covers)</li>
  <li>&#145;Taking Out&#146;/&#146;Combination&#146; (e.g. eliminate the spring and use some
    other means of holding the wheelcover &#150; e.g. Peugeot sometimes use the
    wheel-nuts to hold the cover as well as the wheel - or eliminate the spring
    altogether &#150; e.g. alloy wheels (the wheel is the wheel-cover))</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the GM designers were using Suh to optimise the wrong design.
The &#145;right&#146; design &#150; according to TRIZ &#150; is the one which eliminates the
trade-offs rather than seeking to balance between them. The &#145;Contradictions&#146;
parts of TRIZ provide designers with a systematic approach to finding means of
eliminating those contradictions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Axiomatic approach may have some use in <b>analysing and optimising</b>
the conceptual solutions derived from TRIZ in some cases. In a simple case like
the wheelcover, it is perhaps difficult to see what additional benefits the
Axioms might bring. Moving along to look at the AD/TRIZ connection story from
the perspective of how Axiomatic Design might be usefully applied to help
produce a &#145;better&#146; TRIZ solution, however, we can see that this need not
always be the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Pizza Box</p>
</b>
<p>US patent 5,472,139 is a commonly cited example amongst TRIZ users of the &#145;geometric
evolution of linear constructions&#146; technology evolution trend. The patent uses
the trend as the basis for contouring the base of a pizza box in order to
introduce thermally insulating air-gaps between the pizza and the base of the
box &#150; i.e. a harmful planar contact surface will evolve towards a line-based
contact (and ultimately towards a point-based contact). A sketch of the pizza
box design is illustrated in Figure 6.</p>
<b></b></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial"><b><img SRC="Image6.gif" WIDTH="459" HEIGHT="144"><br>
</b></font>Figure 6: US Patent 5,472,139 Pizza Box</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>The basic idea of the patent is to improve the heat retaining properties of
the box such that the pizza stays hotter for longer.</p>
<p>In terms of Axiomatic Design, the invention sees the introduction of a
Functional Requirement &#145;improve heat insulation&#146; to the basic pizza box FR
of &#145;protect pizza&#146;.</p>
<p>A more complete functional analysis of the pizza-box using Suh&#146;s approach,
however, might well also register the presence of a Functional Requirement to be
able to slice and serve the pizza direct from the box. The 5,472,139 invention
has not been conceived with this requirement fully in mind (NB despite the fact
that the invention is an upgrade of a previous patent by the same inventors
incorporating changes specifically to try to improve &#145;slice and serve&#146;
performance). The simple fact is that the contoured base of the box is not
amenable in a sufficiently practical sense to the use of a cutter to slice <i>in
situ</i> pizza.</p>
<p>The pizza box example demonstrates the importance of identifying all the
necessary FRs to be achieved in a given design. Suh&#146;s Axiomatic Design
methods, while not always able to help identify what &#145;all&#146; means &#150; Suh in
fact recommends QFD for this task &#150; can be very usefully employed to ensure
the chosen FRs are independent and thus consistent with good design practice.
Alternatively, perhaps it is sufficient that AD forces designers to give the
matter of Functional Requirement definition due consideration.</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More Complex Designs</p>
</b>
<p>In more complex cases, there is not yet a substantial enough database of
examples to enable any firm conclusions about the benefits AD might bring to a
TRIZ-based design approach to be made. Preliminary evidence, however, suggests
that Suh&#146;s analytical methods do complement the synthesising capabilities of
TRIZ in at least three significant areas:-</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>a very important philosophical aspect of AD is that there exists a
    necessary process of iteration between FRs and physical design attributes.
    In other words, it is not sufficient to simply define a set of Functional
    Requirements and then set about the process of translating them into Design
    Parameters. The method says that if we are to achieve &#145;good design&#146; &#150;
    i.e. design satisfying the two Axioms &#150; the Design Parameters must be
    allowed to influence the form and content of the Functional Requirements.</li>
  <li>Perhaps the most significant difference between AD and TRIZ becomes
    apparent when considering the hierarchical nature of design problems.
    Aspects of this difference may be seen in a previous discussion regarding
    the design of a helicopter particle separator (Reference 7). Basically,
    meanwhile, AD places careful emphasis on the importance of recognising the
    hierarchical nature of design, and particularly to ensuring that the process
    of iteration between Function Requirements in the Functional Domain and
    selection of Design Parameters in the Physical Domain (shown as the green
    arrows in the following figure) is carried out in a systematic manner.</li>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial"><img border="0" src="Sprite_7.jpg" width="338" height="408"><br>
</font>Figure 7: Hierarchical Nature of Functional Domain &#150; Physical Domain
Mapping</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>As may be seen in Figure 7, this systemisation occurs through an essentially
top-down approach; definition of System Level FRs permits derivation and
iteration of System Level DPs (green arrow &#145;A&#146;) and then &#150; most
importantly &#150; definition of the System Level DPs is necessary before FRs at
the next level down in the hierarchy (blue arrow &#145;B&#146;) may occur; and so on
right through each level of the hierarchy. In effect, AD suggests that
finalisation of top level FRs can only really be achieved after each layer of
the problem hierarchy has been given due consideration and iterated accordingly.</p>
<li>As well as recognising the relationship between Functional Domain and
  Physical Domain, Suh further extends the AD model to include what he describes
  the Process Domain (Reference 1, Section 4.10). In other words, AD demands
  that manufacturability issues are given appropriate consideration <b>during</b>
  the process of iterating to achieve the most appropriate form of the design
  Functional Requirements (i.e. we might add a third &#145;Process Domain&#146; column
  to Figure 7 above).</li>
</ol>
<p>It would appear that Axiomatic Design has much to offer TRIZ in terms of
providing a better understanding of both the hierarchical nature of design <b>and</b>
the need to pay due attention to the inter-connections which exist between
successive hierarchical layers. A future article will examine how such a process
can be made to work for a real design problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Conclusions</p>
</p><ol>
</b>
<li>From an Axiomatic Design perspective, TRIZ fits very elegantly into the &#145;Ideate
  and Create&#146; element of Nam Suh&#146;s map of the design process.</li>
<li>From a TRIZ perspective, Axiomatic Design offers the potential for improving
  the problem definition and problem solving processes through Axioms offering
  means of assessing the effectiveness of a design concept, and new perspectives
  on the specification of functional requirements and the handling of
  multi-layered problems.</li>
