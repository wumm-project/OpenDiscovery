<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem of gold mining is displayed as a string of
problems. First, you use the Intermediary Principle, then you solve the problem
by the Chemical Effect, and finally you use the Biological Effect according to
the US patent 05378437 &quot;Processes to recover and re-concentrate gold from
its ores&quot;. By the way, you remove a contradiction in space (by the
&quot;Nested Doll&quot; Principle).</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once you could read in the books that gold is mined from gold
sand. &quot;Washing out&quot; is the method&#146;s name. You have to simply
separate the gold grains from the rest ore. Now I ask you: suppose it goes this
way till now. What is the ratio between pure gold and gold ore? 1:10? 1:100?
Wrong. Today gold is recovered from ore body containing</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">gold in an amount of 0.02 oz/ton. It is very low. You can&#146;t
see the gold grain, you can&#146;t wash it out, you can&#146;t seize it with magnet.
So you need another method. Which one do you think?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">hint. <b>The Intermediary Principle</b> says to merge one
object temporarily with another (which can be easily removed).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But gold has little susceptibility to adhesion, or reaction,
or any merging with other materials. Gold is one of the least reactive metals on
earth. It does not combine with oxygen or with nearly any other chemicals, no
matter how corrosive. So you have the <u>problem</u>: what can you attach to
gold when nothing attaches to it?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MIDWAY SOLUTION. There is <b>a chemical effect</b>: gold does
combine with cyanide, however. What are cyanides? These are potassium cyanide,
cyanic acid&#133; -- briefly, all those containing CN group.</p>

    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#C0C0C0">
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of the commonly used industrial methods for
        removing gold from ores require the use of cyanide. The cyanides are
        brought into contact with gold ore, causing production of &quot;gold ion
        &#150; cyanide ion&quot; complexes:&nbsp; <font SIZE="5"><br>

      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>
  </div>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the pure gold is recovered from these complexes &#150;
it is not a problem. So what is the problem? Cyanide is highly toxic, hazardous
to the environment and difficult to remove. It is responsible for several
environmental impacts, including air and water pollution. Although cyanide will
degrade, for example, in a surface exposed to ultraviolet light, aeration and
complexing with various chemicals present in the water, such degradation is a
wholly unsatisfactory approach to removing cyanide from the environment. Cyanide
solutions are often kept in open ponds and frequently birds or other animals are
exposed and killed by the toxic material.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So, the <u>contradiction</u> looks like this: the cyanides
must be to recover gold but must not be in order not to harm the environment.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THE CONTROL ANSWER. <b>Biological Effect</b>: some
microorganisms (algae, fungi and bacteria) are capable of producing cyanide ion.
By the way, blue-green algae are known as cyanobacteria and/or photosynthetic
bacteria.</p>

        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us mark the main stages of this method according
        to the US patent 05378437:</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1) Culturing microorganism species capable of
        producing cyanide ion, thus forming a cyanide ion containing and
        producing culture.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here is the exact formula of the reaction (such a
        reaction is called &quot;cyanogenesis&quot;):<br>
        <font SIZE="5">
        <img border="0" src="formula2.jpg" width="327" height="29">,<br>
        </font>where <font SIZE="5"><img border="0" src="formula3.jpg" width="140" height="30"> </font>is
        glycine, <font SIZE="5">HCN </font>is cyanic acid.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2) Contacting the cyanide ion containing and
        producing culture with gold ore, thereby causing production of
        &quot;gold ion &#150; cyanide ion&quot; complexes and dissolution of gold
        from the gold ore.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several possibilities of such complexes: <font SIZE="5"><img border="0" src="formula4.jpg" width="277" height="33"></font></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3) Removing, by biosorption, &quot;gold ion &#150;
        cyanide ion&quot; complexes from solution to said culture.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4) Reclaiming gold from said culture by further
        refining: e. g., through drying (dehydration) the microorganisms.</td>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So, <b>the contradiction</b> &quot;the cyanides must be and
must not be&quot; is removed according to <b>the &quot;Nested doll&quot;
Principle</b>: the cyanide is inside the microorganism but is absent on the
outside.</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1" width="90%">
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#C0C0C0">
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now you might ask: what about the cyanides that do
        not take part in the process and remain after everything is over,
        therefore still endanger the environment? One of the microorganisms
        releases ammonia from cyanide with the following stoichiometry:<br>
        <font SIZE="5">
        <img border="0" src="formula5.jpg" width="430" height="30">,<br>
        </font>where <font SIZE="5">DNA </font>&#150; deoxyribonucleic
        acid. The cyanide has been metabolized by the cell, and does not remain
        in any form. This could be considered an example of the
        discarding/recovery principle.</p>
