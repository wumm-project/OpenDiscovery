<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Transition from solid structures to fragmented or finely dispersed
media is one of the prevailing trends of evolution of technological systems. This trend is
usually described by the Law and Lines of Transition to Micro-Level. The present paper
discusses a new mechanism of transition to micro-level and suggests a method of describing
specific transformations of technological systems along the lines of fragmentation. The
suggested method allows for more accurate forecasting of the next-generation products and
processes.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Introduction</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any autonomous technological system consists of at least four principal
parts: a working means, transmission, engine, and control means [1] (<i>see</i> Fig. 1).</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><img src="image1.jpg" border="0" WIDTH="607" HEIGHT="167"><br>
Fig. 1</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, in a system &quot;machine tool&quot;, an object is a part
to be machined and all the principal components can be easily identified. In a system
&quot;photographic camera&quot;, an object to be manipulated is the light, a working means
is a set of lens, a focus-adjusting mechanism is a transmission, a motor is an engine, an
control in many modern cameras is performed by a microprocessor. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Evolution of technological systems is frequently accompanied by
diversification of characteristics of various segments of their working means. In order to
enhance the primary function of a working means, it may be needed that one its segment is
hard and another soft, one solid and another gaseous, one hot and another cold, etc. This
eventually leads to development of heterogeneous structure of the working means.
Separation of segments with the contradictory properties leads to improvements in
functioning of the system, and to fragmentation of its components, as well as of the
substances used in the system. The latter can be transformed into laminated or fibrous
ones or, ultimately, ones composed of fine particles. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any substance is a multi-level hierarchy of various physical structures
[2], [3]. It is sufficient, for practical purposes, to present this hierarchy as
consisting of the following levels/physical structures:</p>

</p><ol>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Minimally processed substance (&quot;techno-substance&quot;), e.g., a wire.</li>
    <li>Crystal lattices, molecular aggregates, polymers.</li>
    <li>Complex molecules.</li>
    <li>Molecules.</li>
    <li>Fragments of molecules.</li>
    <li>Atoms</li>
    <li>Fragments of atoms</li>
    <li>Elementary particles</li>
    <li>Fields.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any physical structure inhabiting some level in the hierarchy is a <i>micro-level
structure </i>for all the structures that occupy higher levels (<i>macro-levels) </i>[3]<i>,
</i>[9].<i> </i>Fragmentation of substances, or <i>transition to micro-level</i>, is a
process of employing lower-level physical structures. The main advantage of the transition
to micro-level is better controllability of a fragmented or finely dispersed medium by
various fields (mechanical, electrical, magnetic, etc.).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Law of Transition to Micro-Level states that technological systems
evolve in the general direction of increasing degree of fragmentation of their tools.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Transition to molecular/atomic/elementary particle levels has the most
profound effect on a system performance, since at these levels, it is much easier to
accomplish precise and adaptive control of the medium. Numerous examples in the history of
technology illustrate this trend. Evolution of such mechanical units as propeller of an
airplane, cutting tool in a machine tool, bucket of an excavator into jet of hot gases in
jet engines, abrasive jets for machining, high pressure water jets for digging,
respectively. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been generally accepted in TRIZ that transition of the working
means to micro-level proceeds along the Line of Fragmentation shown in Fig. 2. This Line
suggests that if a working means presently performs at the certain level of the substance
hierarchy, then the next evolutionary step has to be a <i>direct</i> <i>transition</i>,
leapfrog to some lower substance level. A line of evolution of cutting tools in Fig. 2
illustrates this assumption.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Analysis of history of various technological systems, as well as
experience in using TRIZ for real-life system development, show that progression to
micro-level may include some important <i>intermediate</i> phases. Knowledge of these
phases may enhance both problem solving and technology forecasting capabilities of TRIZ.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Dilemma of Transition to Micro-Level</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b>Transition from a macro- to a micro-level (which is usually a
radical transformation) means a shift from one technology, based on particular physical
principles, to another technology based on different physical principles. A radical change
of the working means design may induce fundamental changes in the major adjacent
components (<i>see</i> Fig. 1) and in the overall system. For example, replacement of
conventional material removing technology, based on the use of mechanical cutting tools,
with a technology employing electrophysical or electrochemical phenomena may bring about
major alterations not only in the existing manufacturing infrastructure, but may also
beget financial, environmental, political, and other problems. As a rule, the rate of a
product evolution exceeds that of the overall system (the latter is heavily influenced by
many non-technical factors, such as an economic pressure to continue utilization of
expensive existing manufacturing facilities, psychological inertia, etc.). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes, a factor inhibiting an immediate application of a new,
micro-level technology may reside in the very technology. There may be a situation when
the technology is theoretically and technically feasible but it is either expensive or is
not sufficientrly developed to replace the old technology. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another reason for the lack of enthusiasm towards application of a new
technology may be the fact that the underlying physical processes are not studied well
yet, and this makes the technology risky.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><img src="image2.jpg" border="1" WIDTH="531" HEIGHT="577"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, the process of fragmentation is associated with a conflict: To
enhance the working means&#146; primary function, there should be a transition to
micro-level, however, this transition may generate a wave of undesirable effects in the
overall system. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before we discuss the ways of resolving this conflict, let us introduce
some new notions.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Operation Fields and Control Fields</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b>As well known in TRIZ, a model of a minimal technological system, a
sufield, includes a field (i.e., energy) and two substances (an object to be
processed/controlled and a tool performing the required processing/control). </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="fig3.gif" border="0" WIDTH="237" HEIGHT="135"><br>
Fig. 3</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fields in sufields can be differentiated according to the function they
perform. One can distinguish between <i>operation fields</i> and <i>control fields </i>[4].
An operation field is an energy applied by a tool to the object; a control field is an
energy applied to the tool so the latter can generate the operation field. In view of
this, the diagram in Fig. 3 can be redrawn as follows:</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="fig4.gif" alt="fig4.jpg (3813 bytes)" WIDTH="176" HEIGHT="133"><br>
Fig. 4</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new diagram in Fig. 4 reads: A control field, <b>F<font SIZE="5"><sub>control</sub></font></b>
, is applied to the tool, <b>S<font SIZE="5"><sub>2</sub></font></b>, which generates an
output field, <b>F<font SIZE="5"><sub>operation</sub></font></b>, to apply it to the
object to be controlled, <b>S<font SIZE="5"><sub>1</sub></font></b>. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Effectiveness of a substance control depends largely on the &quot;depth
of occurrence&quot; of the substance structure that is subjected to a input field.
Higher-level substance structures can be easier controlled by the lower-level structures
(for example, by controlling electrons in crystal lattice, one can modify properties of
the latter). The lower the level, which the substance structure occupies, the more
effectively it can realize complex substance control algorithms.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resolving the Dilemma</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A schematic representation of transition to a micro-level (in its
conventional understanding) is shown in Figs. 5a, b. The schematics reflects an immediate
transition of a working means from a macro-level substance structure (i.e., <b>S<font SIZE="5"><sub>2</sub></font></b>) to a micro-level structure (i.e., <b>S<font SIZE="5"><sub>3</sub></font></b>).
In the beginning, Fig. 5a, a control field <b>F<font SIZE="5"><sub>1c </sub></font></b>makes
<b>S<font SIZE="5"><sub>2 </sub></font></b>generate an operation field <b>F<font SIZE="5"><sub>1c
</sub></font></b>that is applied to an object <b>S<font SIZE="5"><sub>1</sub></font></b>;
both fields act at the same macro-level of the substance structure (the substance
hierarchy is shown with the help of the grid inside the block representing the substance).
Transition to a micro-level, Fig. 5b, may require changing the substance structure (from <b>S<font SIZE="5"><sub>2 </sub></font></b>to <b>S<font SIZE="5"><sub>3</sub></font></b>)<font SIZE="5"><sub><b> </b></sub></font>and both control and operation fields.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="fig5.gif" border="0" WIDTH="642" HEIGHT="316"><br>
Fig. 5</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To simplify the following analysis, let us reorganize the diagram in
Fig. 1 by combining three major system&#146;s components &#150; engine, transmission, and
control &#150; in one unit &#150; a <i>governor</i> (see Fig. 6)</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="fig6.gif" alt="fig6.jpg (11186 bytes)" WIDTH="476" HEIGHT="116"><br>
Fig. 6</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Analysis of the historical data has shown that technological systems,
while evolving along the Line of Increasing Fragmentation, progress through phases when
development of working means lags behind the development of the governor&#146;s
components. At these phases, the governor undergoes transition to micro-level, while the
working means continues functioning at the macro-level.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us consider these phases.</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Phase 1:</i> <i>Both operation and control fields act upon the same
  macro-level substance structure of the governor&#146;s <br>
  components.</p>
  </i>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="fig7.jpg" border="0" WIDTH="452" HEIGHT="165"><br>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Example:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Single glass lenses can bring objects into sharp focus at certain
  distances only. The single lens deficiency is eliminated in the conventional two- and
  multi-element lens systems that are designed so that their focus can be varied by
  mechanically changing the axial spacing between the lens. Such systems are used in many
  cameras. The object to be controlled by a camera is the light, the working means is a
  lens, and a focus-adjusting mechanism can be considered as a governor. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In mechanical cameras, a mechanical energy &#150; a control field
  &#150; manually applied to the focus-adjusting mechanism is transformed into a mechanical
  energy (i.e., an operation field) that moves the lens.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this phase, both control and operation fields act at the same
  macro-level of a techno-substance.</p>
</blockquote>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Phase 2: The operation field acts at the same macro-level, while a new
control field acts on a micro-level <br>
substance structure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    </i><p ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="fig8.jpg" border="0" WIDTH="460" HEIGHT="167"><br>
    Fig. 8</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Example:</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many automatic cameras, an electric energy applied to an electric
  motor allows for precision control of the lens movement. In these cameras, the engine
  &#150; the motor &#150; started its descent to the micro-level, while the transmission
  &#150; a gear reducer, that is &#150; still functions at the micro-level. Therefore, the
  following improvements in the lens motion control come from changing the physical
  structure of the transmission.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the embodiments of this approach is a focus-adjusting mechanism
  using a piezo-electric vibrator as a lens drive. In this mechanism, a control field
  (electric energy) acts at the level of atoms thus governing the geometrical properties of
  the higher-level structure of crystal lattice and causing elongation and contraction of
  the piezo-electric material.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the Line of Increasing Fragmentation, after Phase 1, there
should be an abrupt change in the physical structure of the lens: varying of the focal
distance should be based not on the mechanical movement of the lens but on other physical
principles. However, such an abrupt change does not happen. Instead, there is a gradual
process of enhancing the primary function by making the governor&#146;s components to </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The logic of Phase 2 is in resolving the above-described conflict: the
law requires a transition to micro-level, but this may result in undesirable changes of
the overall system. The conflict is resolved by separating the opposing demands both in
space and in time: the transition to micro-level proceeds gradually and
&quot;surreptitiously&quot;; the operation field, generated by the working means, does not
change, while the control field acts at more low levels of the working means substance
hierarchy.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One can notice that the above example is a manifestation of the Law of
Shortening of Energy Flow Path [5]. This Law states that in the process of evolution
technological systems evolve in the direction of shortening of energy passage through the
system. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a rule, this evolutionary process is associated with at least one of
the two following tendencies (Lines of Evolution):</p>

</p><ol>
  <li>Reduction in the number of energy transformation stages (both transformations <br>
    between different forms of energy, such as electrical and mechanical, mechanical and
    thermal, etc., and transformations of energy parameters, such as mechanical transmissions
    transforming speeds and torques/forces between input and output members); and</li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Proliferation of such forms of fields that are easier to control.
    Such forms can be<br>
    listed in the order of increasing controllability: </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>gravitational</li>
    <li>mechanical</li>
    <li>thermal</li>
    <li>electromagnetic (magnetic, electric).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the governor's components have been identified, one can use the
Law of Shortening of Energy Flow Path in together with the rule for determining the name
of physical effects [1]. This rule allows one to determine the required physical effect by
putting together the names of control field and operation field. For example, if a control
field acting on a substance is magnetic, and an operation field is thermal, then the
substance has to realize the magneto-thermal (magneto-caloric) effect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When developing conceptual designs at Phase 2, one can use a simple
  algorithm:</p>
</blockquote>

</p><ol>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Identify the four principal parts of the system, as shown in Fig. 1</li>
    <li>Identify the passage of energy in the system: <i>energy source --&gt; engine --&gt;
      transmission --&gt; working means.</li>
    </i>
    <li>Identify operation field produced by the transmission and control field applied to the
      engine.</li>
    <li>If the control field applied to the engine acts at a micro-level with respect to the
      operation field of the transmission, then eliminate both the engine and transmission and
      replace them with a substance. The physical effect that the substance has to realize is
      determined by joining the names of the control and operation fields.</li>
    <li>If the control field applied to the engine and operation field of the transmission act
      at the same level, then identify a new, desirable control field and apply the procedure of
      the previous step. </li>
    <li>If a physical effect associated with particular control and operation fields cannot be
      identified, then a chain of physical effects should be put together.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This algorithm can be used to identify physical effects at the
following phases of governors' evolution.</p>

    given governor&#146;s substance. What is the next step of evolution? Now, it is the
    working mean&#146;s turn to move down the substance hierarchy. The working means&#146;
    substance is replaced with a new one; concurrently, a new control field that can interact
    with the new substance may be introduced into the system. </p>

      Fig. 10. The two threaded sleeves allow for altering the length of the chamber filled with
      an optically clear fluid (e.g., a gel). Any change in the size of the chamber results in
      altering the degree of curvature of the two transparent flexible plastic membranes, which,
      in turn, causes change of the focal length of the lens unit. If one changes the chamber
      volume with the help of mechanical means similar to those used at Phases 1 or 2, then both
      operation and control fields act upon the same macro-level substance structure of the
      governor&#146;s components. </p>
