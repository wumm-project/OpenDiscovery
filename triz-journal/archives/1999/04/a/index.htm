<p>Introduction</b></p>

<p>A well-known European company organises and runs an annual design competition aimed at
solving a real engineering problem. The 1998 competition looked at the problems associated
with rapid, safe wheel changes on Formula 1 racing cars. The objectives for the
competition were:-

</p><ul>
  </p><ul>
    <li>To design a new, failsafe wheel nut locking system that can be reliably used for high
      speed wheel changes during a Formula One race, and,</li>
    <li>To design a failsafe device which &#145;locks the air wrench to the nut until an
      automatic locking mechanism is activated which would prevent the nut coming off the
      axle&#146;.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>The eventual solution also needed to take account of the fact that a typical Formula 1
pit-stop may last less than 10 seconds - hence wheel removal and safe replacement must be
achievable within this time-frame. Pit crew size means that there are typically two people
available to perform any given wheel change. It is also assumed that the solution is
required to be available for the 1999/2000 racing season.</p>

<p>The problem is re-analysed here using Ideal Final Result and Inventive Principles
aspects of TRIZ.<b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ideal Final Result</b></p>

<p>Looking at this type of problem from an Ideal Final Result (IFR) perspective is usually
a very good first step. There are a number of ways of performing such an analysis.
References 1 and 2 provide a useful foundation. Basically, the IFR has the following 4
characteristics:

</p><ol>
  <li>Eliminates the deficiencies of the original system</li>
  <li>Preserves the advantages of the original system</li>
  <li>Does not make the system more complicated (uses free or available resources.)</li>
  <li>Does not introduce new disadvantages</li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes Altshuller&#146;s established Trends of Technology Evolution can provide
assistance in formulating the IFR, and sometimes less structured approaches are necessary.
Either way, the most important feature of an IFR assessment is the long term visioning
capability of the problem solver.</p>

<p>In the case of this wheel nut problem, it was speculated that the IFR was one in which
the need for wheel changes was eliminated altogether. Wheel changes take place only
because the car tyres lose their properties during a race; if a tyre could be designed in
which this loss of properties did not occur, then there would be no need for a tyre change
and hence no need for a rapid, safe, wheel nut.</p>

<p>Clearly, the &#145;no wheel change&#146; IFR is some way different from today&#146;s
situation of a self-locking nut with a fail-safe. It is quite commonly the case that the
distance between today&#146;s situation and the IFR is so great that we do not know how to
physically achieve the IFR solution. To this author, the most powerful aspect of the IFR
philosophy then is the formulation of a route map identifying different levels of solution
between today&#146;s solution and the IFR. For the locking wheel-nut, this route map
assessment resulted in the picture shown in Figure 1:-</p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="Image145.gif" border="1" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="333"><br>

</font><b>

<p>&nbsp;</b>The analysis identified two possible &#145;generations&#146; of design
solution between the &#145;no wheel change&#146; IFR and today&#146;s designs. (Other
problems may result in different numbers of such intermediate level solutions). Generally
speaking, the thought processes involved in picturing the solution evolution are best done
from the IFR backwards. In other words, if we are unable to generate a &#145;no wheel
change&#146; solution, the next best answer in this case was felt to be one where there
was no nut. Similarly, if we are unable to identify a no-nut solution, the next best
answer would be one in which the nut was inherently fail-safe and did not therefore
require a separate fail-safe mechanism.</p>

<p>(It is useful to note that the Figure 1 route map for this specific problem has
similarities with the trend of technology evolution relating to &#145;trimming&#146;
&#150; i.e. that systems evolve to do more with less.)</p>

<p>The route map is a very important conceptual tool because it allows the problem solver
to gauge the situation in terms of the technological and other problem constraints. For
example, given the constraint on time &#150; i.e. the solution is required for the
1999/2000 racing season &#150; it may be viewed that the science involved in achieving a
&#145;no wheel change&#146; solution is not yet mature enough to attempt such a solution.</p>

<p>The strategy is then to work away from the IFR towards the left along the route map
until a solution meeting the prevailing constraints becomes achievable:-</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>&#145;No Nut&#146;</b></p>

<p>The generation before the IFR was felt to be a solution in which the need for a nut was
eliminated. The basic idea here was that the solution comprises just a wheel and an axle.
Such a solution demands that we solve a physical contradiction: the axle must hold the
wheel (when the car is in motion) AND the axle must not hold the wheel (when we want to
remove the wheel). Such a contradiction is amenable to a solution in which the
contradictions are <b>separated by</b> <b>time.</b></p>

<p>TRIZ Inventive Principles such as &#145;Dynamics&#146;, &#145;Preliminary Action&#146;,
or &#145;Partial or Excessive Action&#146; are commonly applied to good effect in such
time-based physical contradictions.</p>

<p>&#145;Dynamics&#146; in this case, in turn then suggested a solution in which a shape
memory effect material is used in the axle design. Conceptually speaking such a design
might work such that the shape memory axle locks the wheel in place at ambient
temperature, and, on application of a localised heat source during the pit-stop, would
transition to another &#150; non-wheel-locking &#150; position. </p>

<p>Once conceptualised, it then becomes necessary to evaluate the physical realities of a
solution idea. In this case it means looking at the capabilities of shape-memory metals.
According to References 3 and 4, the maximum achievable shape change available will be
between 1 and 10%. All of the wheel attachment load will effectively need to be carried on
this change volume. Other aspects requiring evaluation include:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>* Ability to apply heat source - locally</p>
    <p>* Ability to apply heat source &#150; quickly (&lt;10second wheel change)</p>
    <p>* Lack of material lifing database</p>
    <p>* Running friction? </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>While none of these issues were found to be ultimate &#145;stoppers&#146; to the idea
of a &#145;no wheel nut&#146; design solution, it was felt that <b>today</b>, the extreme
(cyclic) loading conditions present in the Formula 1 car and the lack of an adequate
material fatigue database, precluded this idea as a viable solution within the time
constraints set for the problem. </p>

<p>The idea may well have its day in the future, but for now, it appears that we will have
to step back a generation in looking for a 1999/2000 solution:</p>
<b>

<p>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>Self-Locking Nut State of the Art </b></p>

<p>The world knows many methods of securing and locking a threaded nut to a bolt. These
methods include:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>* Wire locking</p>
    <p>* (arguably) spring washers</p>
    <p>* Double/jam nuts</p>
    <p>* Solutions involving glueing</p>
    <p>* Nylon inserts (&#145;Nyloc&#146;)</p>
    <p>* Non-round nuts (Cleveloc)</p>
    <p>* Segmented nuts (Aerotight)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <b>
</blockquote>

<p></b>The latter three (Figure 2) appear most amenable to use in the Formula 1 wheel nut
problem.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image146.gif" border="1" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="216"><br>
<font SIZE="2">Figure 2: Typical Self-Locking Nut Design Solutions</p>
</font>

<p>The general problems with these solutions are that:-

<ol TYPE="a">
  <li>they lose their locking properties with repeated use &#150; often in an unpredictable
    manner, and,</li>
  <li>they require initial &#145;bedding-in&#146; &#150; i.e. locking torque loads for the
    first application are significantly higher than for subsequent applications</li>
</ol>

<p>i.e. they have only a relatively small &#145;window&#146; of viability &#150; they will
only lock at a known torque setting during around the 4<sup>th</sup> to something like
their 20<sup>th</sup> application.</p>

<p>The general problem with the other methods (e.g. wire-locking, glueing, double-nut) is
that they are incompatible with the sub-10second wheel change requirement. </p>

<p>Of all the possibilities, the double-nut (basically two nuts &#150; one to lock the
wheel, the other to lock the first nut) appeared to offer the best potential. A solution
offering the reliable locking properties of the double nut without the need to perform two
separate tightening operations may be seen as a &#145;best of both worlds&#146; solution.</p>

<p>This idea was looked at in conjunction with the list of Inventive Principles. The
Inventive Principle &#145;Merging&#146; very quickly gave the conceptual idea of &#145;one
nut that thinks it is two&#146;, which in turn, fairly rapidly highlighted patent
5,662,443 from the Illinois Tool Works in 1997 &#150; reproduced in Figure 3. </p>

<p>The Illinois solution is indeed one nut which thinks it is two. According to the patent
report, it is projected to offer no loss of locking properties after repeated and
prolonged applications. As such it appears &#150;conceptually at least - to offer a viable
solution to the Formula 1 problem.</p>

</font>

<p>(Incidentally, while this author arrived at the above solution through use of the
Inventive Principle &#145;Merging&#146;, it may well also have been possible to derive a
similar answer to the &#145;one nut that thinks it is two&#146; problem using the Feature
Transfer part of the Invention Machine TechOptimizer software.)<font SIZE="2"></p>
</font><b>

<p>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>&#145;Failsafe&#146;</b></p>

<p>The competition specifically called for &#145;a failsafe device which locks the air
wrench to the nut until an automatic locking mechanism is activated which would prevent
the nut coming off the axle&#146;. With this constraint, the competition effectively
restricted the chosen solution to reside within the current generation of
separate-fail-safe design solutions.</p>

<p>For the sake of the competition, a number of methods of locking the Illinois Works nut
to the wrench were developed. It is likely, however, that the 5,662,443 patent offers the
prospect of moving to the next generation (no-separate-failsafe) solution now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Conclusions</b>

</p><ol>
  <li>The Ideal Final Result visioning strategy offers a powerful and systematic method of
    looking at a problem. </li>
  <li>Similarly, filling in the generational gaps between IFR and today&#146;s solution offers
    a systematic means of identifying which solution level is most appropriate to the
    underlying technical and logistical constraints associated with a given problem scenario.
    Generally speaking, it is best to work from right to left; starting with the IFR and
    working back until a solution which satisfies the prevailing constraints emerges.</li>
  <li>In many senses the &#145;separate fail-safe&#146; specification has falsely constrained
    the Formula 1 wheel nut problem. As ever, effective <b>problem definition</b> is crucial
    if the &#145;right&#146; solution is to be achieved. </li>
