<p ALIGN="CENTER">Abstract</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the 1980s industries in North America and Europe experienced severe
competitive pressures from Japanese manufacturers. The dramatic advantage in quality and
productivity held by companies such as Toyota, Hitachi, Sharp and Sony resulted in a
wholesale redistribution of market share from the US to Japan. What were some of the
weapons in the Japanese arsenal? The widespread application of statistical and quality
methods taught by Dr. W. Edwards Deming and Joseph Juran coupled with powerful techniques
such as Quality Function Deployment, Robust Design Just-in-Time Manufacturing and Total
Quality Management created advantages in cost, development cycle time, delivery time, and
customer satisfaction.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, the quality, productivity and cost gap has narrowed
considerably. As a result, the basis for competitive advantage has shifted to a new set of
factors. The key strategies as the millennium approaches are: 1) An exceptional
understanding of user values, 2) Time to market, 3) Innovation and 4) Product
differentiation. TRIZ provides a powerful scientific set of competencies to leverage an
organization's ability to compete successfully in the new paradigm.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introduction</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the basis for competition has changed, the strategies to generate a
defendable competitive advantage must likewise change. The dynamics of the marketplace
demand a fresh approach to understanding customers, technology, and the internal processes
utilized to design and develop new products. One common misconception in product
development is that a First-to-Market strategy is more desirable than being second or
third. Conventional wisdom is that companies that are first are innovators while companies
that are second are imitators. Furthermore, conventional wisdom holds that innovation is
always superior to imitation. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This paper challenges the notion that first to market, by definition,
implies a company is innovative and in a superior competitive position. The historical
record is, in fact, replete with successful second and third entrants as well as some that
were first. The question to ponder is - How can an organization decide which strategy is
best? The answer of course is - It depends. Depends on what? The key factors outlined to
answer that question in the paper are: 1) The ability of an organization to protect its
proprietary technology, 2) The Complementary Assets required in the field to support the
new product, 3) The Dominant Design Paradigm, 4) Technology maturity, 5) Competitive
position and 6) The degree of technology criticality.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Need for New Product Development</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A stream of new products is the future lifeblood of any organization.
As product development cycles continue to shorten, companies must continually retool and
improve their new product development (NPD) processes. Coupled to importance of
efficiencies in the commercialization of technology, is the necessity for providing novel
customer centric products. John Tyson, VP of Nortel summed up today's competitive
imperative by stating &quot;Superior design will always arise from the deep understanding
of three fundamental user values: profound simplicity, conspicuous value and
self-evidence.&quot; </p>

<p>There are several famous quotes from times past that shed light on the shortsightedness
of some individuals regarding the appearance of new innovative technologies. Within the
TRIZ lexicon this phenomenon is called Psychological Inertia (PI). See Table 2.</p>

<p>The book <i>Winning New Product and Service Practices for the 1990s </i>analyzed the
revenue distribution of the best companies versus the rest. The financial yardstick was
the amount of revenues received from products based on six categories. The six categories
are: 1) New to the World, 2) New to Company, 3) Line Extensions, 4) Revisions, 5)
Repositioned and 6) Cost Reduced products. The data unmistakably shows that the best
companies have significantly higher revenues in the &quot;New&quot; categories while the
rest are selling Revisions and Repositioned products. See Figure 1.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Elements of NPD</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New product development is the future lifeblood of all organizations
whether they are in the manufacturing or service sector. The best companies view NPD as
the battleground where the viability of the organization is determined. The demands of the
market place, the globalization of industry and ever more sophisticated and demanding
customers are putting tremendous pressures on organizations to perform - flawlessly.</p>

<p>What should a &quot;World Class&quot; NPD system look like? The table below lists seven
elements that should be part of every new product development system. See Table 3.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b>Item number one in the architectural schematic above, Product
Development Strategy, initiates the product development process and provides the long term
rationale for which markets ant the type of products the company will develop. The new
product development strategy itself is derived from a hierarchical set of inputs. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inputs to product development strategy start at the top with a
definition of the corporate long-term objectives. A component of long-term objectives is
some articulation of how the corporation is going to grow the business. The growth
objectives break down into the contribution to growth by new products which, in turn,
gives rise to a new product development strategy. A subset to the product development
strategy is the NPD differentiation strategy which, is the focus of this paper. The entire
hierarchical decomposition is shown in Figure 5.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New Product Development Strategy</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Successful product development strategies are a result of leveraging
three internal elements. The three elements are: 1) Technical advantages and experience,
2) Marketing savvy and 3) Better understanding of the customer. A working knowledge of
TRIZ provides direct input into creating powerful technical advantages. This essentially
accomplished by elimination of system contradictions and harmonizing the elements of the
system. It can also be argued that application of Life Cycle &quot;S&quot; curve analysis
provides insights into how products will evolve. This understanding can provide valuable
glimpses into the future to assess potential customer reactions. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The options open to an organization can be divided into two basic
strategic paths. The first is to introduce products that are similar to current offerings
called &quot;line extensions,&quot; or products that are &quot;new-to-the company, or
new-to-the world. Line extensions themselves can be further subdivided into four different
types of extensions. The four are: 1) low-end (commodity) products, 2) next generation
products, 3) breakthrough products and 4) high end products. The four options can be
graphed on a two-axis plot correlating price to performance. See figure 6.</p>

is right for the organization? The table below provides some possibilities. Note: the TRIZ
techniques are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second product strategy option is to introduce new-to-the company
or new-to-the world products. These types of products typically provide the greatest
profit opportunities as well as the greatest risks for introducing cash draining
&quot;white elephants.&quot; All the more reason that one has to think through the
strategic options available.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the critical decisions when introducing a new-to-&quot;x&quot;
product is whether one should be first to market or a fast follower. To term it slightly
differently whether to &quot;innovate or imitate?&quot; There is a natural seductive pull
to being able to lay claim the competitive space by being the first to market. Is this
always the best strategy? The answer is it depends on three critical factors i.e., the
ability to protect proprietary knowledge, the emergence or non-emergence of the dominant
design paradigm and the complementary product assets required to maintain the product in
the field. Table 6 shows winners and losers in both innovator and imitator categories.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Table 5.</b></p>

<p>The three critical factors to weigh when considering whether to innovate or imitate
include:

</p><ol>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Protection regimes</li>
    <li>Dominant design paradigm</li>
    <li>Complementary assets</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Definitions:</b></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Protection regimes</b> define the ability of an organization to protect
its intellectual property. In some countries this can be accomplished through patent
filings. Where patent laws are not respected, this obviously is a non sequitur. Even where
patent laws are respected, some companies eschew them in favor of trade secrets i.e., the
recipe for Coca-Cola syrup. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dominant design paradigm</b> defines a stage in the evolution in the
product where a &quot;standard' approach to the product emerges. For example, when Henry
Ford built the moving assembly line, he defined the standard way to build and assemble
cars (the dominant paradigm) which is still being followed today.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Complementary assets</b> are any unique requirements of the product or
the technology to ensure market viability. This could include specialized manufacturing or
processing equipment, unique distribution channels or novel requirements for maintaining
and servicing the product after it has been introduced.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additional information on these critical factors is provided in figures
7,8,9.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Development Strategies</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If one assumes that the dominant design paradigm has manifested itself,
then the two remaining factors can be evaluated on a two-axis plot to provide some
guidance on whether to innovate or to imitate. See Figure 10.</p>

<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The TRIZ Connection</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once an organization has made a rational decision on which product
strategy to pursue from the logic plot shown on the previous page, the opportunities for
utilization of TRIZ is obvious; at least to those who have a fundamentally sound
understanding of the methodology. If the strategy is to be a &quot;fast follower&quot; or
to imitate, the organization can leverage their product through the elimination of the
inherent shortcomings of the original introduction. This is primarily a function of
elimination of residual contradictions and improving the product to a degree that it is
noticeable and significant. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If, however, logic dictates that innovative (first to market) products
are the logical choice; TRIZ can provide solutions and concepts that are not limited by
Psychological Inertia. Once an &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; solution is conceptualized, the
various known laws of technological systems evolution provides an ability to create
strategic patent umbrellas for a succession of line extensions and derivative products.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Conclusion</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since its arrival to the US in the early 1990s, TRIZ has opened up a
whole new way of thinking and approaching the full spectrum of product development issues.
For line extension products that need to be differentiated, the powerful tools for
component elimination, reassignment of functional requirements, and elimination of
inherent system contradictions provides the TRIZ practitioner with enhanced product
development capabilities. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For new-to-the world or new-to-the company products, TRIZ in
conjunction with a rational strategic choice can be employed to create competitively
superior and defendable products.</p>
