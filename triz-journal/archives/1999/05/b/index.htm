<p>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>Since Goldratt introduced the logical thinking process as an integrated
problem solving tool in the early 1990s, the Conflict Resolution Diagram (CRD),
or &quot;evaporating cloud,&quot; has been one of the most powerful tools
available for resolving conflict. In fact, it’s one of a very few methods
capable of formally structuring &quot;win-win&quot; solutions.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strength of the Conflict Resolution Diagram</b></p>
<p>The strength of the CRD lies in two characteristics. First, it’s superior
at structuring and graphically illustrating the crucial elements of any
conflict, from the overt indications through the ultimate objectives of each
side. Second, it helps to expose and identify the unspoken assumptions
underlying each element of the conflict. Knowing what these assumptions are is
the key to resolving the conflict in a &quot;win-win&quot; manner.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Weakness of the Conflict Resolution Diagram</b></p>
<p>But like most tools, the CRD is not perfect. While it is strong in the areas
mentioned above, it is also somewhat weaker in one key area: idea generation.
The whole purpose of the CRD is to get at an idea for resolving the conflict—an
&quot;injection.&quot; But this is the one aspect of using the CRD that could
use some help. For generating injections, Goldratt has offered the idea of a
reference environment (also called an alternative environment). While this
approach can be effective on some kinds of problems it, like brainstorming,
leaves something to be desired for many people.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TRIZ: The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving</b></p>
<p>Fortunately, using any problem-solving tool is not an &quot;either-or&quot;
proposition. It’s possible, perhaps even desirable, to combine the use of more
than one tool, possibly producing a better solution than either one alone might
have. One such tool that lends itself uniquely well to integration with the CRD
is TRIZ, an acronym for the Russian words meaning &quot;theory of inventive
problem solving.&quot;<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="1a"></a></p>
<p>TRIZ offers something important that the CRD doesn’t: a structured approach
to the generation of ideas. This characteristic fills the weak spot of the
Conflict Resolution Diagram exceptionally well. Moreover, TRIZ also has some
common ground with the CRD, as we’ll see later. Given the remarkable
&quot;fit&quot; between the two tools, it seems obvious to combine the two
techniques.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONFLICT RESOLUTION DIAGRAM: A QUICK REVIEW</b></p>
<p>The CRD is composed of five elements: a common objective, two non-conflicting
requirements, and two conflicting prerequisites. (See Figure 1) The essence of
achieving &quot;win-win&quot; solutions lies in the idea that both requirements
are satisfied, not necessarily both prerequisites.</p>
<p><img src="Image170.gif" border="1" width="600" height="606"></p>
<p>To use the CRD to fashion a &quot;win-win&quot;solution, normally the
conflicting prerequisites are articulated, then the requirements they support
and the common objective of the two requirements are expressed. After these five
elements are in place, the assumptions associated with each leg of the diagram
are &quot;coaxed out&quot; into the open. The objective of this effort is to
identify the assumptions that are either faulty to begin with or that might be
rendered invalid by some other alternative action. Finally, when all the
assumptions are exposed for each leg of the diagram and the vulnerable ones
identified, an injection (idea for a solution) is created, usually to replace
one or both of the conflicting prerequisites. Figure 2 indicates the steps in
the process of constructing a CRD.<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="2a"></a></p>

<p><img src="Image171b.gif" border="1" width="275" height="367"></i><b></p>
<p>INTRODUCTION TO TRIZ</b></p>
<p>TRIZ was developed by Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="3a"></a><a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="4a"></a><a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a><a name="5a"></a><a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a><a name="6a"></a><b>
</b>in the former USSR starting in 1946, and is now being developed and
practiced throughout the world.<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a><a name="7a]"></a></p>
<p>TRIZ research began with the hypothesis that there are universal principles
of invention that are the basis for creative innovations that advance
technology, and that if these principles could be identified and codified, they
could be taught to people to make the process of invention more predictable. The
research has proceeded in several stages over the last 50 years. Over 2 million
patents have been examined, classified by level of inventiveness, and analyzed
to look for principles of innovation. The three primary findings of this
research are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Problems and solutions were repeated across industries and sciences</p>
<p>2. Patterns of technical evolution were repeated across industries and
sciences</p>
<p>3. Innovations used scientific effects outside the field where they were
developed</p>
<p>Much of the practice of TRIZ consists of learning these repeating patterns of
problems, solutions, patterns of technical evolution, and methods of using
scientific effects, and applying the general TRIZ patterns to the specific
situation that confronts the inventor. Figure 3 describes this process.</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="Image172.gif" border="1" width="500" height="353"></i></p>
<p>Early research indicates that inventors using TRIZ experience improvement of
70% to 300% or more in the number of creative ideas that they generate for
solving technical problems and in the speed with which they generate innovative
ideas.<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a><a name="8a"></a> When TRIZ was first
introduced to practitioners of Quality Function Deployment, the appeal was
immediate in both Japan and the U.S.<sup><a href="#9">9</a><a name="9a"></a><a href="#10">10</a><a name="10a"></a><a href="#11">11</a><a name="11a"></a><a href="#12">12</a><a name="12a"></a></sup></p>
<p>There are many ways to organize the tools and techniques of TRIZ. A flow
chart is useful when introducing TRIZ, since it shows how the tools are related,
as well as what they are. Figure 4 is a typical flow chart used for either a
product design or process development problem.</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="Image173b.gif" border="1" width="500" height="681"><br>
</i>The first stage is analysis. Tools shown on the flow chart are:</p>
<p>· <i><b>Functional Analysis.</b></i> Analyze the system, subsystems, and
components in terms of the functions performed— <i>not the technologies used.</i>
One new technique in TRIZ is &quot;trimming&quot;—examining each function to
see if it is necessary, and, if it is, whether any other element of the system
could perform the function. Breakthrough designs and reductions in cost and
complexity are frequent results of functional analysis and trimming.</p>
<p>· <i><b>The Ideal Final Result. </b></i>Express the situation in terms of
why the innovation is needed, using language independent of both technology and
implementation. Strategic breakthroughs frequently come from the insight gained
at this step. Quality improvement opportunities can be identified by finding
what elements make the system non-ideal. The progress that a design makes from a
starting point toward the ideal final result is called &quot;ideality&quot; and
is defined using the value equation as</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="CENTER">Ideality <font size="2">= </font></b><font face="Symbol" size="2">S</font><b>
Benefits / ( </b><font face="Symbol" size="2">S</font><b> Costs + </b><font face="Symbol" size="2">S</font><b>
Harm)</b></p>
<p>· <i><b>Resource Analysis.</b></i> Identification of the available things,
energy sources, information, functions, and other elements that are in or near
the system, that could be combined with the elements of the system to improve
it. Quality Function Deployment practitioners will find that an awareness of the
uses of resources in TRIZ changes the way that they conduct customer observation
visits.<a href="#13"><sup>13</sup></a><a name="13a"></a></p>
<p>· <b>Locating the Zones of Conflict.</b> More familiar to quality
improvement researchers as &quot;root cause analysis.&quot; Understanding the
exact cause of the problem. The &quot;zone&quot; refers to the time and place
that the problem occurs, and the process includes understanding why the problem
occurs, as well. The conflict resolution diagram (CRD) is a very powerful way of
locating the Zones of Conflict.</p>
<p>About 45% of the time the problem is solved in the analysis phase; that is,
by the time the analysis is done, the solution, or &quot;injection&quot; in CRD
terms, has become obvious. If the problem has been solved in the analysis phase,
developers frequently proceed to implementation. If it has not been solved, or
if alternate solutions are desired for maximum creativity, the data-based tools,
Principles, Prediction, and Effects, are used. Although the flow chart shows a
decision (diamond symbol <b>à</b> ) indicating the choice of tools, in many
TRIZ applications all three of the data-based tools of TRIZ are used.<i></p>
<p>· <b>Principles (also called resolution of contradictions).</b></i> <i>Technical
contradictions</i> are the classical engineering &quot;trade-offs.&quot; The
desired state can’t be reached because something else in the system prevents
it. <i>Physical contradictions</i> are situations where<b> </b>one object has
contradictory, opposite requirements. For example, in packaging it’s common to
make a container stronger by making the walls thicker. But this also makes the
container heavier. Strength increases (good), but weight also increases (bad).
The same problem can be expressed as a physical contradiction: The container
should be heavy, but the container should be light.</p>
<p>Once the contradiction is defined in terms of standard parameters, the
problem is solved by application of the four separation principles (for physical
contradictions) or the 40 principles of conflict resolution (technical
contradictions.) The data base of these principles is available in several
forms, and can be downloaded from the worldwide web.<a href="#14"><sup>14</sup></a><a name="14a"></a></p>
<p>· <i><b>Prediction (also called Technology Forecasting).</b></i> TRIZ
identifies 8 patterns of technical evolution. Designs of systems, subsystems or
components can be deliberately moved to the next higher stage within a
particular pattern, once the pattern is identified. The eight patterns are:</p>
<p>1. Increased Ideality</p>
<p>2. Stages of Evolution</p>
<p>3. Non-uniform development of system elements</p>
<p>4. Increased dynamism and controllably</p>
<p>5. Increasing complexity, then simplicity</p>
<p>6. Matching and mismatching of parts</p>
<p>7. Transition to micro level and use of fields</p>
<p>8. Decreased human interaction (increased automation)</p>
<p>Space does not permit us to provide examples for all of these patterns, but a
few examples can serve to illustrate them. Pattern 4 can be demonstrated by the
history of the drive mechanisms for machines. The bicycle started with a rigid
drive, then progressed to a flexible chain with gears. Now new bicycles with
continuous hydraulic drives systems are in use. Pattern 7 can be illustrated in
several ways—mechanical surgery (cutting with knives) has been replaced by the
use of &quot;fields,&quot; such as focused acoustic energy to destroy kidney
stones and laser energy to reshape the eye’s cornea. Physical fences have been
replaced by infrared signal systems for property protection, by electrostatic
systems for pet control, and by acoustic systems for agriculture (the sounds of
birds in distress to keep birds away).<b></p>
<p>· <i>Effects. </i></b>Use scientific and engineering phenomenology and
effects outside the discipline in which they were developed. Tools include data
bases, science encyclopedias, and searches of the technical literature to find
alternate ways to achieve the functions that are needed to solve the problem.
Classical examples include the use of geometrical solutions to mechanical
problems (use of a Moebius strip doubles the lifetime of a belt) and use of
biological solutions to chemical problems (tailored bacteria that
&quot;eat&quot; contaminants, instead of complex filters) as well as use of
common science from one area that is unknown in others (carbon-14 dating was
well-known in chemistry for 30 years before archeologists learned about it.)</p>
<p>The last block in the flow chart is Evaluation of Solutions. Solutions are
compared to the Ideal Final Result, to be sure that the improvements do advance
the technology and meet the customers’ needs. Multiple solutions may be
combined to improve the overall solution using a Feature Transfer<a href="#15"><sup>15</sup></a><a name="15a"></a>
which is similar to Pugh concept selection and improvement.<a href="#16"><sup>16</sup></a><a name="16a"></a>
Tools of the Thinking Process could be combined with the TRIZ tools in this
phase, to check the logic of the solution.</p>
<p>The flow chart shows that remaining problems are resolved by iterating the
process. The advantage of TRIZ is that the iterations are very fast, and a great
number of innovative ideas are developed at each stage.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A &quot;LEARNING LABORATORY&quot;: APPLYING THE CRD AND TRIZ</b></p>
<p>To demonstrate how the CRD and TRIZ might function effectively together, let’s
look at a complex example: the Challenger accident. There can’t be many people
who don’t know about this tragedy in the American space program. However, most
people probably don’t realize that application of the CRD and TRIZ could have
prevented this disaster. Here’s how it might have transpired.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Challenger Current Reality Tree</b></p>
<p>Almost everybody knows something about the causes behind the Challenger
accident, but most people don’t realize that the critical root cause was not
the infamous &quot;O-rings&quot; that received such attention from the press.
The real causes lay much deeper than that. The chain of cause-and-effect that
culminated in the explosion of the Challenger on January 28, 1986 began in 1972
with NASA’s acquisition policies. Figure 5 is a representation of the factual
situation in the form of a Current Reality Tree.<a href="#17"><sup>17</sup></a><a name="17a"></a>
For the purposes of our example, only the lower levels of the tree are shown
here.<a href="#18"><sup>18</sup></a><a name="18a"></a></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="Image174b.gif" border="1" width="600" height="809"></p>
<p><img src="Image175b.gif" border="1" width="550" height="746"></i></p>
<p>Like most complex problem situations, especially vehicle accidents, there are
many contributing causes to the Challenger disaster and several key points at
which the deadly chain of cause-and-effect might have been interrupted. One of
these points occurred in 1977. Morton Thiokol, the contractor selected to
provide the solid rocket boosters (SRB) for the Space Shuttle, had been awarded
the contract based primarily on the low cost of its bid. The reason Morton
Thiokol was able to submit such a low bid was that their design concept involved
scaling up in size the design for their Titan III solid rocket booster, a
proven, reliable &quot;workhorse&quot; of space operations for many years. The
contractor foresaw no difficulty in doing this.</p>
<p>But a major &quot;oops!&quot; occurred on the way to production of the Space
Shuttle SRBs. The smaller Titan III booster had been assembled vertically. The
larger Space Shuttle booster had to be assembled horizontally because existing
frameworks were not large enough to accommodate the much taller Space Shuttle
SRB. Laying the large diameter, thin-walled booster casing on its side caused
the cylinder to flatten slightly, making it impossible to fit booster segments
together at the joining point with the original design specifications.</p>
<p>Morton Thiokol engineers immediately proposed redesigning the booster casing,
but they were shot down by both NASA and their own senior management because of
the prohibitive cost and the schedule delay that would have been incurred. The
only other solution (&quot;injection&quot;) they could think of at the time was
to enlarge the receptacle space (clevis) in one of the booster segment joints to
create a looser fit, allowing the &quot;out of round&quot; pieces to fit
together. They did this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this solution produced a new problem, which will be discussed
in more detail below. In entities 204-205 (Figure 5b), we find the first place
after contract award where the causality leading to the accident might have been
broken with a combination of the Conflict Resolution Diagram and TRIZ.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Engineering Conflict Resolution Diagram</b></p>
<p>At each of several sequential events along the way, the Morton-Thiokol
engineers were faced with conflicts that could have been effectively expressed
in a Conflict Resolution Diagram. The first time they realized they had a
problem occurred when they tried to fit two rocket motor segments together at
the aft field joint. Because of the distortion of the booster casing’s shape,
the clevis and tang would not connect. This would not likely have been a problem
with the smaller Titan III SRB, but the increase in size (cross-sectional area)
of the larger shuttle SRBs, coupled with horizontal assembly, created the
distortion. The CRD at this stage of development might have looked like Figure
6.</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="Image176b.gif" border="1" width="600" height="639"></i></p>
<p>NASA and Morton Thiokol senior management put some restrictions on the
engineers. They had to come up with some way to solve the problem without
assembling the SRB vertically or redesigning it. This is not an unusual
situation. In the real world, boundaries on potential solutions are often
imposed with no room for negotiation.</p>
<p>As indicated earlier, the engineers decided to increase the specification for
one part of the segment joint—the clevis—so that the tang of the
out-of-round SRB segment would have some &quot;wiggle room&quot; to fit into the
clevis. This &quot;injection&quot; seemed to satisfy both requirements. But it
created a new problem that wasn’t discovered until subsequent hydrostatic
testing: the SRB now leaked at the modified joint, and that leak posed an
unacceptable flight hazard. In an attempt to salvage their first injection
(enlarging the specifications), they decided to add another one: insert 180
&quot;shims&quot; in the joint after the segments were mated to apply sufficient
pressure to discourage the pressure leak. As we now know, this
&quot;band-aid&quot; was an unsatisfactory solution—it created a safety
problem later on. Let’s see how TRIZ might have been applied to create a
&quot;breakthrough&quot; idea that would have satisfied simultaneously the
safety, cost, and ease-of-assembly requirements.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A TRIZ Solution to the Engineering Conflict</b></p>
<p>The TRIZ Ideal Final Result tool is used to keep focus on the broad scale
problem. In this case, the Ideal Final Result is that <i>&quot;the parts mate
every time, simply, with no added processes, and no leakage.&quot;</i> Had the
original team used a statement like this, they might have avoided the complex
solutions that made the problem worse than the patch that tried to &quot;fix the
fix.&quot;</p>
<p>The CRD has identified contradictions present in the problem: shape
(circularity) gets worse as area increases (improves). Another way of expressing
this might be: &quot;As area increases, manufacturability deteriorates. Keeping
costs as low as possible will be a decision rule for evaluating any potential
solution. One of the oldest and simplest of the TRIZ tools can take us quickly
to a family of creative solutions that resolve those contradictions to the
satisfaction of both sides, rather than trading off one against the other.</p>
<p>The technology of the time was such that increased power requirements (R1)
demanded a larger booster, which translated to an increase in the
cross-sectional area of the booster case (P1). This was a prerequisite imposed
at the design stage by the laws of physics and chemistry. It left the engineers
with only one option: figure out how to maintain the circular shape of the
booster casing without sacrificing the cross-sectional area. So the two critical
engineering parameters are <i>area</i> and <i>shape:</i> as the area of the
cross-section improves, the shape of the cross-section deteriorates.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 40 Principles of Problem Solving and the Contradiction Matrix</b></p>
<p>One of the first outcomes of Altshuller’s research on the common
characteristics of breakthrough solutions was a set of 40 principles of problem
solving.<a href="#19"><sup>19</sup></a><a name="19a"></a> The truly innovative
ideas Altshuller found in the study of hundreds of thousands of patents seemed
to fall into 40 generic categories, or principles. Further, he noted that the
inventive solutions in these patents resolved some kind of trade-off, or
contradiction. Altshuller defined a contradiction as a situation where an
attempt to improve one feature of the system detracts from another feature.<a href="#20"><sup>20</sup></a><a name="20a"></a>
Over time, Altshuller found 39 such contradicting features, from which he
constructed a cross-interaction Contradiction Matrix. The features in
contradiction with one another are the entering arguments of the matrix. The
intersecting cells contain the numerical designations of the principles that
apply.</p>
<p>Both the 40 principles and the complete Contradiction Matrix are too
extensive to be included in this paper. They are available in <i>Step-by-Step
TRIZ: Innovative Solution Concepts</i> (3<sup>rd</sup> ed.) (Terninko, Zusman,
and Zlotin), or by file download from For illustration purposes, two of the
separation principles are shown in Figure 7, and a portion of the Contradiction
Matrix is provided in Figure 8<a href="#21"><sup>21</sup></a><a name="21a"></a>.</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="Image177b.gif" border="1" width="450" height="452"></p>
<p><img src="Image178b.gif" border="1" width="550" height="654"></i></p>
<p>Although the numbers in the cells of the matrix identify the principles
leading to the <i>most probable</i> solutions, they do not guarantee solutions.
But the recommendations are remarkably useful. For example, for the
contradictions labeled in Figure 8, principles 24 and 34 are among those cited.
Figure 7 defines these principles and indicates examples of their application.</p>
<p>Combining these principles leads to the idea of forming the booster segments
into a perfectly circular shape for mating by the use of a removable (principle
34) mediator (principle 24), or &quot;jig.&quot; (See Figure 9) While the jig
holds the circular shape, the segments are moved horizontally into position. The
jig is then removed. The segments are successfully joined without having to
relax the original clevis-and-tang specifications. The tight fit ensures seating
and sealing of the O-rings with no pressure leakage, and the Challenger
explosion never occurs.</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="Image179b.gif" border="1" width="550" height="406"></i><b></p>
<p>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p>You’ve seen an example of the effectiveness of combining two different
system improvement tools in solving an engineering problem. Those already
familiar with the Theory of Constraints know that the Conflict Resolution
Diagram is particularly useful in resolving non-technical conflicts, such as
interpersonal, organizational behavior, or policy contentions. What is not
obvious (and we did not have the space here to address) is the fact that
although Genrich Altshuller created TRIZ specifically to solve engineering
problems, it can be applied with equal effectiveness to non-technical,
qualitative, or policy problems as well. But that is a subject for another
day...</p>
<p>The Conflict Resolution Diagram in itself is a powerful tool for system
improvement. TRIZ in itself is, too. Used together, they can reinforce each
other to produce better, more creative solutions to complex conflict-related
problems.</p>

    Challenger accident is a matter of public record and is thoroughly detailed
    in the Presidential Blue Ribbon Commission Report available through the
    Library of Congress and the Government Printing Office. However, most
    readers would probably prefer the more easily digestible form: Harvard
    Business School Case Study Nos. 9-691-037 and -039, <i>The Final Voyage of
    the Challenger</i> and <i>The Final Voyage of the Challenger: Aftermath</i>.
    These case studies are highly recommended reading, as they painfully
    illustrate the two of the last three steps of a project: &quot;The search
    for the guilty&quot; and &quot;Punishment of the innocent.&quot;</font></li>
