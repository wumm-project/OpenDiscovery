<p>Formulation of exhaustive set of possible for analyzing system problems is very
important stage of work on searching of breakthrough under TRIZ theory. After data
collection and systematization of major information, translation of information to
&quot;TRIZ language&quot; is required to ensure efficient utilization of tools of directed
evolution. The translation implements by means of artificial intellect &quot;Problem
Formulator&quot;.</p>

<p>User makes functional description of the system in form of the graph then Problem
Formulator software translating it to problem statements. This description includes
exhaustive set of problems that can be formulated under this description.</p>

<p>There are two stages in problem formulation.</p>

<p>1. Preliminary formulation, that covers main technological processes, clarification and
discussion of worked out formulators with Subject Matter Expert (SME.)</p>

<p>2. Final Formulation, that includes clarification of general and working out of
detailed formulators on different processes, and also selection and analysis of obtained
problem statements.</p>

<p>Problem Statements Analysis </b></p>

<p>After problem formulation the analysis of problem statements is performed. The
following questions have to be answered for each Problem Statement developed:

</p><ul>
  <li>Are we going to work with this problem statement or it should be marked as «out of
    scope»?</li>
  <li>How important is it to solve this problem statement from the initial problem point of
    view? Is the expected result going to be significant if the solution to this problem
    statement is found?</li>
  <li>If this problem statement is important, does it make sense to look for an exhaustive set
    of solution concepts or one acceptable solution will do?</li>
  <li>Is it possible to find a solution to this problem statement without special TRIZ tools?</li>
  <li>If a simple solution concept is available, does it have a drawback or side effect, i.e.
    creates secondary problems? Does it make sense trying to solve these secondary problems
    rather then looking for other solution concepts?</li>
</ul>

<p>It is necessary to remember:

</p><ul>
  <li>Several problem statements may be integrated into one Direction for Innovation. When a
    problem statement leads to Direction, which was revealed earlier, we mark this Direction
    as repetitious one.</li>
  <li>If priorities change with the time, estimations made on the preliminary analysis stage
    may be corrected during work continuation. </li>
</ul>

<p>After the analysis of each problem statement the analysis and structuring of the
obtained directions and concepts is performed. Then its general list is compiled, as a
rule structured by basic functions performed by the system or its main structural units.</p>

<p>The final conclusions for the preliminary Ideation/TRIZ analysis of the system are
constructed on the basis of structured information.</p>
