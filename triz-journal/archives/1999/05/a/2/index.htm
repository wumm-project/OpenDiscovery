<p><font SIZE="4"><b>Applying Operators (knowledge base) for generating suggestions:</b></font><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p>Each problem statement has been considered according to the following criteria;

</p><ul>
  <li>Representing a promising direction for innovation</li>
  <li>Being relevant to the project</li>
</ul>

<p>Approximately 50 problem statements were selected for further consideration in the
environment of the Brainstorming Process (Ideation, 1998). The following ideas were
obtained as a result of this process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>Score quality progress. When score is visible, the top management will demand
  improvement and link the demand to salary.</p>
  <p>Quality score can make the quality performance more objective than subjective.</p>
  <p>Raise the salary in Quality Office.</p>
  <p>Raise the prestige of Quality Office.</p>
  <p>Make Quality certification a requirement for promotion.</p>
  <p>Make the value and cost of Quality more visible up-front.</p>
  <p>Priority - make Quality more of a priority than short-term cost.</p>
  <p>Use different kind of resources.</p>
  <p>Use an external &quot;critic&quot; to explain to management how bad current situation
  currently is. This will generate more resources.</p>
  <p>Add &quot;fudge&quot; or &quot;safety&quot; multiplier to quality projects.</p>
  <p>Allocate engineers by disposition/job - use &quot;fire-fighters&quot; only at end of
  programs; use people with &quot;prevention&quot; mentality up-front on programs.</p>
  <p>Use &quot;certified&quot; engineers or former quality office engineers up-front in new
  programs</p>
  <p>- more than 20% of population in any new model program.</p>
  <p>Split team into parts - induce friendly competition between areas to use quality and
  reliability methods.</p>
  <p>Induce friendly &quot;competition&quot; between other vehicle teams.</p>
  <p>Use quality tools to reduce cost and improve quality at the same time</p>
  <p>Increase rotation from Quality Office to Product Development - but keep appropriate
  balance of assisting organization with knowledge and keeping Quality group effective.</p>
  <p>Make special training/knowledge/software available to quality office that is useful for
  managers. Make this a Quality Office perk that makes the office more respectable.</p>
  <p>Combine &quot;lack of resources&quot; with &quot;lack of use of Quality Tools&quot; -
  you must use the Quality tools to match your resources with the job.</p>
  <p>Teach engineers - enable them to use the quality methods as the way to do a good
  design.</p>
  <p>Use first on external suppliers - then migrate into company (increases reputation and
  confidence before applying inside company).</p>
  <p>Lack of resources = lack of knowledge. Quality knowledge and skills is a resource that
  can influence the need for other resources of cost and timing.</p>
  <p>Special effort to design the system where the sub-system elements evaluate each other
  and provide feedback. Quality Department can facilitate this process - way to participate
  in Product Development and gain respect.</p>
  <p>Attach some TGRs for engineers to the quality effort, so they will not mind the effort
  associated with quality improvement (i.e. certification will result in higher salaries in
  the next job, increase the value of the person with special education, software, etc.).</p>
  <p>Connect with what management knows.</p>
  <p>Create a very good model so that management can see the benefits of the solution idea.
  Use imaginary story to illustrate how it would work. Thought experiment/description.</p>
  <p>Resonate the system - have the solution idea appear from many different initiatives,
  different organizations, and different companies at the right time -reinforce the idea as
  the right thing to do.</p>
  <p>Use competing organization bosses to out-do each other in implementation - keep
  informing the other boss of competitor's progress.</p>
  <p>Self-synchronicity, program automatically adjusts effort based upon feedback.</p>
  <p>Create a model of management reaction - use it as a game to test presentation/response
  and refine presentation before it is presented.</p>
  <p>Anticipate questions and prepare answers ahead of time.</p>
  <p>Prepare for desired response ahead of time by reviewing with key management people in
  1/1 before the meeting.</p>
  <p>Use something that has been tested before in your or another industry.</p>
  <p>Get other people in the system to support the solution idea and be allies. Go to
  service, assembly, and manufacturing ahead of time and bring their comments/support to the
  meeting.</p>
  <p>Connect this program to an initiative existing in the organization that management
  wants to do.</p>
  <p>Advertisement principle - use a metaphor/medium that highlights the positive benefits
  of the solution idea. Use a special newspaper or column in existing newspaper, Internet
  news, local broadcast, publish in external magazine or conference to demonstrate
  credibility, establish a &quot;chat&quot; room.</p>
  <p>Use comments from respected individuals to create excitement about the initiative.</p>
  <p>Concentrate, focus - reduce or delay other competitive initiatives - focus on this one
  now to utilize resources.</p>
  <p>Make it easier to use the quality methods by making it difficult to defend design in
  reviews if you do not do it. Quality Office then becomes a coach to help the engineer pass
  the review. Use other departments or outside to provide the critique. Provide a
  &quot;bonus&quot; award for a successful review. Use &quot;Tom Sawyer Fence&quot; effect.</p>
  <p>Send design team off-site ... perhaps a supplier company that uses quality techniques -
  remain in residence in the different environment until significant progress is made.</p>
  <p>Make a portion of the environment &quot;unstable&quot; to make it easier for the team
  to change. Find area with new boss, recent problem, people rotation, change work time or
  shift, etc. &quot;Hawthorne effect.&quot;</p>
  <p>Create right amount of intermediate pressure, stress or risk to do this initiative.
  Introduce a special tax for quality. Reward the discovery of a mistake before initial
  release of design.</p>
  <p>In presentation show how use of this methodology would have prevented problems in
  actual situations. Use real stories that people remember for the thought experiment.</p>
  <p>Engineer gets complete set of &quot;quality credits&quot; by implementing initiatives,
  then can use this set to avoid a management presentation, get extra vacation day, etc.</p>
  <p>Make &quot;game or puzzle&quot; of methodology and encourage engineers to learn the
  method by doing the game.</p>
  <p>Put in Network, a &quot;quality tip of the day&quot; when start computers. Should be
  interesting to read ... short stories, interesting pictures, etc.</p>
  <p>Bundle changes and introduce a group of them at one time.</p>
  <p>&quot;Scare&quot; the top management to force them to take immediate actions.</p>
  <p>Find a &quot;young start&quot; in the organization, convince them to make a long-term
  commitment.</p>
  <p>Leverage your mission, values and guiding principles.</p>
  <p>Show some short term successes.</p>
  <p>Solve painful problem and show the real saving.</p>
  <p>Introduce quality approach into cost reduction and time-to market reduction programs.</p>
  <p>Concern: Quality approach might not be credited in the case of success.</p>
  <p>Validation of design via failure prediction session with following test that could
  prove the tools and processes effectiveness.</p>
  <p>Concern: People rotation causes loss of knowledge and accountability.</p>
  <p>Get top management of other companies to persuade.</p>
  <p>Get top management to talk to customers.</p>
  <p>Invite quality guru to talk to management.</p>
  <p>Establish a forum for frequent communication to ensure acceptance.</p>
  <p>Visualization of the concept benefits and intermediate results.</p>
  <p>Accountable metrics, process measures, etc.</p>
  <p>Good process measures for engineers to monitor the results.</p>
  <p>Make management a feature speaker at a quality conference.</p>
  <p>Special event at a professional society for top management to discuss quality issues.</p>
  <p>Apply for prestigious quality awards:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Apply for the Malcolm Baldrige Quality award.</li>

  <p>Make customers part of the design team.</p>
  <p>Exclude elements (eliminate the need for an element):</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Example: for Halloween have a contest for the most weird idea</li>
    <li>Add a Quality Office person to participate in design teams; ask questions and share
      ideas between teams.</li>
    <li>Cross-reference by part, by function, by problem, in the knowledge database.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Building bi- and poly-systems.</p><ul>
    <li>Utilize independent partner/platform to conduct a parallel design and compare to
      eliminate mistakes and improve timing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&quot;Towing&quot; bisystem.</p><ul>
    <li>&quot;Towing&quot; system &#150; existing methods of Quality assurance. It is
      recommended to introduce new elements into them. Build a picture of the future system we
      would like to have and develop a smooth transition path. </li>
    <li>Another way is to use existing computer tools as a &quot;towing&quot; system.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alternative bisystem.</p>
  <p>Combine design and testing systems. Test engineers should be able to conduct a
  &quot;thought&quot; project testing (following specific rules developed for that purpose)
  and then run real tests. Testers&#146; experience together with the knowledge of
  Anticipatory Failure Determination methods could be very useful for timely discovery of
  possible mistakes.</p>
  <p>Symbiotic bisystem.</p>
  <p>Designer and manufacturing personnel could serve as elements of a symbiotic system.
  Similar process is used in DFMEA. The process could be enforced if all parties were
  encouraged to test the project from various points of view than from their positions only.</p>
  <p>Decrease the degree of stability. Transform an object from stationary to movable.</p>
  <p>Design stability is provided by a stable design team. Usually, one individual starts
  the project and leads it to the end. However, it has a side effect: stable (the same type
  of) mistakes (psychological inertia prevents a person that made a mistake from revealing
  it). A design team&#146;s stability may be purposefully reduced via intentional change of
  leadership on different project stages. For example, switch two project leaders between
  projects. They should have similar working experience to easily transfer the knowledge
  about their projects. At the same time, it is much easier to identify mistakes of each
  other.</i></font></p>

<p>Revealing and analyzing similar projects in other areas</b></font><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p>The following systems have been identified as relevant:

</p><ul>
  <li>Ideal manufacturing process</li>
  <li>Ideal software development</li>
</ul>

<p>The following ideas developed in the areas mentioned above which could be applied:</p>

<p>From manufacturing:

</p><ul>
  <li>Develop clear requirements and an appropriate process check.</li>
  <li>Involve every participating individual in the process check. In particular, each
    individual responsible for an operation in a chain at the same time is checking if the
    previous operation was performed right. Every one should immediately report a problem in
    case of a mistake revealed and even be allowed to stop the manufacturing process.</li>
  <li>Coordinate work of different departments and people. Quality is a result of common
    efforts, therefore effective contacts between people and departments should be
    established. It is very important to overcome traditional isolation and attempts to
    &quot;point fingers&quot; to outsiders.</li>
  <li>Develop a clear understanding that it is a customer who pays our bills and make it as an
    element of the corporate culture.</li>
</ul>

<p>In software development, the approach has been working since 1960s. It was started by
Turing and Deikstra. Ideal software development was based on ideas of structural
programming, that is, development of a complete set of structural elements and algorithms,
and connecting them into an integrated structure. Further development of ideal programming
was based on developing mathematical models of data structures and algorithms of their
transformations. Later, the number of mistakes dramatically reduced due to implementation
of Object Oriented Design, that is, building a program from a set of readily available
objects and modifiable supplements. Theoretically, today it is possible to develop ideal
programs however; they are not going to be optimal from the memory, speed and other
computer resources utilization. Often, mistakes appear because of numerous changes to
already done programs as a result of trying to fix initially wrong design. To reduce
number of mistakes, various methods are utilized; some of them could be applied to design
process as well, for example:

</p><ul>
  <li>Utilization of specialized software monitoring the process, documenting steps.</li>
  <li>Utilization of specific software intended to automatically recognize the most frequent
    typical mistakes.</li>
  <li>Utilization of artificial models for testing. Use of soft (mental) tests rather than
    real (hardware) testing.</li>
  <li>Utilization of special software tool kits (like Visual Basic) for fast software
    prototyping.</li>
  <li>Introducing standard procedures for customers&#146; satisfaction surveys and testing
    allowing data accumulation and transfer in convenient and easy-to-operate format.</li>
  <li>Unit-by-unit testing starts from the beginning of the project rather than wait until the
    project is completed.</li>
  <li>Implementation of specific protection unit into the program capable to quickly identify
    a mistake and promptly prevent from its harmful consequences.</li>
  <li>Introducing new methods via quickly evolving software to dramatically change methods of
    work without disturbing the structure of social relationships and to avoid costly
    re-training.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, a practical approach to mistakes is taken including understanding of
inevitability of mistakes in the process of software development, therefore to focus on
their prevention, prompt discovery and correction.<b></p>

<p>Revealing the main trends in design methods evolution</font></b><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p>Design is a specific activity directed to creation of new products, processes,
services, etc. or their essential enhancement. It involves identification of the main
function(s) of the system under development and methods of their realization. Design
includes two interconnected processes:

</p><ul>
  <li>Thinking about the future system (designer&#146;s thinking)</li>
  <li>Development of description of the system allowing system reproduction (drawings, models,
    text documents, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking back on the history of technology one can see that in the beginning of the
technological era the most important thing was an idea that people were trying to realize
without any intermediate steps. For example, a builder was building a house or a small
bridge without drawings introducing changes to the real object.</p>

<p>Next, various means of a project documentation and visualization were introduced:

</p><ul>
  <li>Modeling (a master was building and presenting to a customer a model of a church, or a
    ship)</li>
  <li>Making sketches (usually 3D) instead of models</li>
  <li>Technical drawing with various views, cross sections, etc, completed according to
    specific rules. Utilization of special equipment to facilitate the process (drafts desks,
    tools, etc.) </li>
  <li>Computerization of drawings (CAD/CAM, PRO-Engineer, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, evolution of design thinking is far behind the evolution of design tools.
In fact, for a long period there was no attention to thinking process and designers have
been taught just to follow more experienced colleagues. The following improvements
however, have been made:

</p><ul>
  <li>To enhance design process (in particular, reduction of mistakes), various standard
    parts, units, etc. have been developed and implemented. That has moved design work to the
    next level, that is, combination of standard parts and units into required systems.</li>
  <li>Introducing rules in drawing process allowed reducing number of mistakes and made the
    process check easier.</li>
  <li>In the middle of our century, first specific techniques helping perform some of the
    design steps and solve typical design problems emerged, such as brainstorming, QE, VE,
    QFD, DFMA, etc. TRIZ is one of them, too. Some of these techniques have software support.
    The main problem on this stage is that although techniques mentioned above are rather
    effective for specific steps, however an attempt to combine them all together make the
    design process too complicated and designers are reluctant to use them at all or use in
    inefficient way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Design process improvement evolved in parallel to the evolution of other organizational
elements and management theory. Number of design departments, designers&#146;
specialization and level of hierarchy have been growing constantly. Together with some
limited improvement it resulted in significant increase in project time and number of
mistakes. Two reasons could be responsible for that:

</p><ul>
  <li>Non-linear growth in efforts required improving mature systems that have practically
    exhausted resources of growth (Maturity stage on the S-curve):</li>
  <li>Bureaucratization </li>
</ul>

<p>Typical drawbacks of traditional designer&#146;s approach and thinking process:

</p><ul>
  <li>Psychological inertia, pressure of traditional assumption without questioning them</li>
  <li>Fear of new ideas, desire to stay with traditional proven solutions </li>
  <li>Fast deactivation of brain in addressing creative problems</li>
  <li>Focusing on main functions and elements with insufficient attention to auxiliary
    functions and system elements</li>
  <li>Focusing on performance rather than addressing potential harmful (side) effects</li>
  <li>Lack of understanding of evolutionary nature of technology and attempts to move against
    strong trends of evolution</li>
  <li>Lack of understanding of the importance of the &quot;dimensional&quot; and systemic
    factors, that is, potential emergence of undesired effects caused by changing system
    dimensions an /or by integration of parts into the system</li>
  <li>Attempts to solve a problem in a given (in most cases accidental) statement without
    proper understanding the problem nature</li>
  <li>Fear of contradictions</li>
  <li>Fear to make a mistake, seeking overprotection</li>
</ul>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conclusions

</p><ol>
  </b></i>
  <li>Existing design thinking is far behind relative to design means.</li>
  <li>Spontaneously developed culture of design has many drawbacks and cannot satisfy
    requirements of today's design</li>
  <li>The next step in design evolution including cultural, technical and organizational
    issues has to be made as follow:</li>
</ol>

</p><ul>
  <li>Introduce an integrated process and philosophy of design based on identifying its main
    steps and formulate main ideas introducing a creative approach into each step (like Robust
    Engineering Process).</li>
  <li>Develop an organizational culture and structure supporting the ideal process.</li>
  <li>Develop an integrated computer aided process addressing all process steps.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><b><font SIZE="4">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Formulating contradictions and potential ways for their resolution</font><font SIZE="3">
<i></p>

<p>The main contradiction in the evolution of design methods could be formulated as
follow:</i></b></p>

<p>Improvement of design means (complex drawings, various CAD systems, etc.) negatively
impacts creative thinking process. For example, we found out that creative output of a
brainstorming group working with drawings 3-5 times lower than working with real objects.
Also, it was discovered that utilization of computerized design techniques makes the
situation with creativity even worse because operating computer programs is very
destructive for thinking process.</p>

<p>This contradiction may be resolved by development of software that supports all types
of activities, that is, drawing and thinking.</p>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contradiction related to quality:</b></i></p>

<p>Usually, quality and cost of products and processes are in contradiction, that is,
quality enhancement leads to increase in cost, while cost reduction deteriorates quality.
Cost/quality relationship strongly depends on the company technological and organizational
culture and is not necessarily sharp in some industries. However, is very painful in
mature industries dealing with high volume production.</p>

<p>This contradiction may be (at least partially) resolved by coming up with inventions
capable simultaneously increase quality and reduce cost, for example come up with less
parts, operations, etc. </p>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contradiction related to innovations</b></i></p>

<p>Inventions (innovations) break the vicious circle of contradiction and allow improving
both quality and cost. However, it is very difficult to rely on inventions, as they cannot
be controlled, planned, or ordered. A mismatch between well-planned design process and
non-predictable inventions is a very serious contradiction in evolution of technology and
human life in general.</p>

<p>This contradiction may be resolved via utilization of systematic innovation based on
TRIZ that allows obtaining inventions where and when they are needed.</p>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contradictions in testing new systems

</p><ol>
  </b></i>
  <li>Testing is necessary to unveil mistakes and drawbacks, however it increases cost and
    takes time.</li>
  <p>Possible resolution to this contradiction &#150; mental tests (simple, quick, reliable,
  and inexpensive).</p>
  <li>Test has to be extensive to give all answers and not to be to avoid high cost.</li>
  <p>Possible resolution in developing new testing procedures utilizing a knowledge base.</p>
  <li>It is easy to prevent and/or fix problems in the start of a project, however, at that
    time people are usually are not aware of potential problems. Problems accumulate to the
    end of the project but now it is to expensive to handle them</li>
</ol>

<p>Possible resolution in applying Anticipatory Failure Determination process (Ideation,
1998) at a very early stage to predict potential failures. </p>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Psychological (people related) contradictions

</p><ol>
  </b></i>
  <li>An individual has to think positively and be very confident in his/her decisions to make
    a good design. However, he/she has to be capable to be a critique mode of mind to look for
    mistakes, drawbacks, week sides, etc. Normally it is very uncomfortable to look for
    mistakes in your own design.</li>
  <p>Resolution of this contradiction is in separating idea generation and evaluation steps
  in time or between different individuals.</p>
  <li>An individual has to be focused on something (like the main system function) to make it
    good. However, many other issues have to be considered as well: reliability, quality,
    manufacturability, cost, compatibility, convenience, esthetics, etc. </li>
  <p>Potential resolution &#150; iterative work with concentration on one issue at the time
  followed by integration. Still, it is complicated, requires systemic vision.</p>
  <li>Creativity is not in a good relationship with certainty. To unleash natural creativity,
    it is recommended to abandon precise terminology, use vague statements, which is helpful
    for drawing analogies. At the same time, it is very important to be very accurate and
    certain to make a good design. It is difficult and psychologically uncomfortable to
    combine these two mutually exclusive capabilities.</li>
  <p>Resolution of this contradiction is in separating processes in time or between
  different individuals.</p>
  <li>For American and European culture, an individual feels very comfortable when he/she is a
    &quot;hero&quot; (fire fighter) because of finding a solution to the already recognized
    and painful problem. On the contrary, it is very uncomfortable to be a bad news messenger,
    that is, trying to uncover potential problems (be negative). </li>
</ol>

<p>Resolution of this conflict may be in arranging special sessions when only negative
statements are appreciated.</p>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organizational contradictions</b></i>

</p><ol>
  <li>Substantial reduction of defects will be profitable for the company as it reduces cost
    of design, warranty costs, increases sales, etc. However, it may be painful for various
    categories of people, for example:</li>
</ol>

</p><ul>
  <li>Warranty department: it will shrink</li>
  <li>Engineering departments &#150; less engineers will be required</li>
  <li>Car service people &#150; sales will drop</li>
  <li>Sales &#150; less spare parts will be consumed</li>
</ul>

<p>Resolution &#150; changing the organizational structure parts supply policy, reward
system, etc.

</p><ol>
  <li>Once there is a &quot;fire&quot; in the company, all limitations are lifted, all
    resources are available to fight it. However, a small fraction of these resources could be
    enough to prevent the fire but usually they are not allocated for this purpose.</li>
</ol>

<p>Potential resolution &#150; in changing organizational culture or in &quot;arranging
fires&quot; like special anti-defect sessions in the process.</font><font SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>Integrating preliminary ideas into concepts</b></font><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p>The main target of integration process is building the concept of &quot;Future
Design&quot;.</p>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Basic culture and principles of preparing people to adopt Future Design</b></i></p>

<p>The following issues should be addressed to establish the basic culture and principles
of preparing people to adopt Future Design:

</p><ul>
  <li>Know and understand design stages and main requirements to each stage.</li>
  <li>Understand that technological evolution follows pre-determined certain patterns, know
    how to use patterns/lines of technological evolution and market evolution to develop high
    value products.</li>
  <li>Understand mechanisms of psychological inertia and know how to control creative activity
    to avoid brain deactivation. Be able to psychologically concentrate on a problem.</li>
  <li>Eliminate fear of contradictions, understand their nature and know how to handle them.</li>
  <li>Understand that ideas shouldn&#146;t be rejected because of side effects or secondary
    problems, know how to address secondary problems.</li>
  <li>Know how to replace an unsolvable problem with another one that is easier to address and
    provides desired results (in a different way). </li>
  <li>Know how to unveil mistakes ahead of time and efficiently fix them.</li>
  <li>Know and utilize on each design stage a standard set of universal creative techniques
    such as controlling psychological inertia, functional problem description, simple models
    and their transformations, utilization of resources to approach ideality, working with
    contradictions, universal operators, main patterns of evolution, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organizational aspects</b></i></p>

<p>The following issues relate to the organizational processes that could eliminate (or
dramatically reduce) number of design iterations:

</p><ul>
  <li>Introducing the following three sub-steps on most of design stages:</li>

</p><ul>
  <li>Combination of two types of work on each stage:</p><ul>
      <li>Individual work (involved utilization of computer tools)</li>
      <li>Team work (brainstorming procedure supported by the software could be utilized).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Utilization of various internal and external resources to improve testing as follow:</p><ul>
      <li>Use designers involved in development of one unit to test other designer&#146;s work</li>
      <li>Use designers involved in similar unit development from another platform for testing</li>
      <li>Use specialists from testing departments (&quot;fire fighters&quot;) to test design</li>
      <li>Use &quot;fresh brain&quot; (for example, people from one department to help test
        another department's products)</li>
      <li>Divide a team into two and have a contest in effectiveness of unveiling mistakes</li>
      <li>Use people with natural &quot;preventive&quot; mentality, psychologically comfortable
        with AFD approach</li>
      <li>Use trained AFD specialists to facilitate AFD sessions</li>
      <li>Mobilize people intellectual resources via reward system encouraging &quot;critique
        view&quot; and creative approach to eliminating unveiled drawbacks</li>
      <li>Use parallel design for the most important subsystems. In normal situations, it causes
        unnecessary duplication and fighting. However, with utilization of special ITRIZ technique
        called &quot;Hybridization of alternative systems&quot; and providing combination of
        advantages and diminishing drawbacks may produce an additional useful effect.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Introduce a special step in design process (or test) for quick and effective mental or
    limited real testing after pre-determined milestones. </li>
</ul>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Basic techniques and tools for Future Design</b></i>

</p><ul>
  <li>There is no doubt that the Future Design is going to be software based including
    advanced versions of existing software like CAD CAM or PRO Engineer. However, besides this
    tools supporting project management and documentation, other special software should be
    included. Software system providing support to creative activity and data transfer between
    departments.</li>
  <li>Psychological management during solving creative tasks</li>
  <li>System and problem analysis (Knowledge Wizard, Problem Formulation and Failure Analysis)</li>
  <li>New creative concepts generation support (New system synthesis, Directed Evolution)</li>
  <li>Generation of creative solution in the design process (System&#146;s improvement and
    problem solving, Value Quality Analysis)</li>
  <li>Prediction and prevention of failures and other undesirable effects (AFD)</li>
  <li>Creative testing</li>
  <li>Bank of typical problems and solutions (specialized in the area knowledge base including
    potential problems and proven effective solutions to them)</li>
  <li>Specialized search engine based on syntax&#146;s analysis capable to effectively provide
    with necessary innovation information</li>
</ul>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a way to the Future Design</b></i></p>

<p>Today, we have enough elements in place allowing immediate start implementation of the
Future Design, including:

</p><ul>
  <li>Detailed description of design stages and understanding of the connection between design
    and Quality approach</li>
  <li>Methods of creative problem solving</li>
  <li>Methods of unveiling, preventing and eliminating design mistakes</li>
</ul>

<p>Analysis of implementation of useful initiatives in various companies helps
understanding of the main reasons for unsuccessful results as follows:

</p><ul>
  <li>Excessive level of an initiative&#146;s novelty disturbing a company culture and
    traditions</li>
  <li>Excessive pushing an initiative through creating high resistance of individuals and
    organizations</li>
  <li>Competition with other initiatives promoted within the company causing resources get
    scattered between various campaigns </li>
  <li>Initiative disturbs the position of certain departments or individuals causing their
    resistance or even counteraction </li>
  <li>Top management doesn&#146;t support the initiative</li>
  <li>Middle management and employees don&#146;t support (don&#146;t understand their
    benefits) of the initiative implementation</li>
  <li>Initiative does not meet expectations for the following reasons:</p><ul>
      <li>It is not effective enough</li>
      <li>It is effective, however unrealistic promises have been made that couldn&#146;t be met</li>
      <li>It gives short-term benefits only and damaging in a long term aspect</li>
      <li>It is beneficial in long term only</li>
      <li>It causes unexpected undesirable effects shortly after implementation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To prevent problems described above, the following could be done:

</p><ul>
  <li>Detailed preparation, with the use of creative approach and participation of the best
    specialists from various departments</li>
  <li>Utilization of AFD to predict and prevent undesirable effects that could emerge with the
    time </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Modeling the situation unveiling potential positive and negative reaction of various
  groups.</p>
</blockquote>

</p><ul>
  <li>Using games to develop right answers to future questions</li>
  <li>Blending a new initiative into others already planned and/or under implementation to
    match them and even enforce via integration. Cancel the ones that do not match or scatter
    the efforts</li>
  <li>Attract natural alliances, passivate natural rivals, be able to show how everyone can
    benefit (it is not an easy task and requires creative solutions, however, it is important
    to do)</li>
  <li>Mask the novelty of an initiative via blending it in with others that have been already
    tested and proved useful</li>
  <li>Use information about initiatives implemented by competitors to prove that approach is
    useful</li>
  <li>Test an initiative in selected departments first. The best candidates could be the ones
    that are already changing (because of a new boss, beginning of a large project, recent
    recall problem, people rotation, &quot;Hawthorne effect&quot;, etc.</li>
  <li>Test an initiative with a supplier</li>
  <li>Use effective advertisement agencies&#146; methods to promote initiatives.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gaining the support of the top management</b></i></p>

<p>The following considerations may help achieve the top management support:

</p><ul>
  <li>Unveil the danger(s) of existing situation for the top management. For that, one has to
    make a hidden danger visible</li>
  <li>Conduct (jointly with respectable specialists) an AFD of design system to unveil
    problems and dangers.</li>
  <li>Develop a case study using a situation that has already proved to be dangerous and
    &quot;playing it backward&quot; showing how AFD could predict and prevent it.</li>
  <li>Conduct an AFD session of a real completed design ready for testing. All potential
    problems unveiled during this session could be validated during following up testing.</li>
  <li>Quality projects usually are associated with expenses that may not be recoverable from
    the top management point of view. Combining quality enhancement with the cost and/or
    time-to-market reduction may change this attitude.</li>
  <li>Find a way to directly address shareholders to convince them to entertain long-term
    initiatives.</li>
  <li>Use professional magazines respectable by the top management to discuss the existing
    design system&#146;s drawbacks.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gaining the support of the middle management and employees&#146; cooperation</b></i></p>

<p>On this level, the most important is to elevate the Quality Office prestige to a higher
level as follow:

</p><ul>
  <li>Introduce Quality certification for managers and employees as a necessary element to be
    promoted.</li>
  <li>Rotate future project managers through Quality Office and design departments.</li>
  <li>Pay the most attention to young designers that will use quality education to be
    promoted.</li>
  <li>Establish quality reward system</li>
  <li>Put Quality tip of the day into everyone&#146;s computer</li>
  <li>Increase salaries for Quality people</font></li>

<p>Anticipatory Failure Determination</b></font><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p>The purpose of Anticipatory Failure Determination (AFD) is to help identify and
understand the underlying causes of a system's drawbacks. Frequently, we observe negative
effects within a system but do not recognize their root cause(s). At other times, until
shortcomings manifest themselves in a product while in use, they are not recognized at
all. By gaining an early fundamental understanding, one can then often eliminate the
drawback at its cause, rather than compensating for its negative effect(s). Eliminating a
problem at its root, when possible, is always most advantageous.</p>

<p>AFD consists of two overall stages. In the first stage the original problem statement
is transformed by re-stating the question(s) regarding the failure:</font></p>
<div align="left">

<table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="3">
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><font SIZE="3"><b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Original question:</b></font></td>
    <td VALIGN="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><font SIZE="3"><b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Substitute question
    :</b></font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><font SIZE="3">1. Why did the failure occur?</font></td>
    <td VALIGN="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><font SIZE="3">How can we create this failure?</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><font SIZE="3">2. What failures may occur in the
    system?</font></td>
    <td VALIGN="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><font SIZE="3">How can we damage the system? or: <p>How
    can we induce the most dangerous undesirable phenomena?</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div><font SIZE="3">

<p>The inventive power of the methodology can now be used to answer the newly formulated,
&quot;pro-active&quot; questions.</p>

<p>The second stage of AFD helps tackle the problems related to preventing the anticipated
drawback(s). This is also accomplished with the help of the Ideation Methodology.</p>

<p>AFD offers two approaches: </p>

<p>AFD-1: <b>Investigation</b>: Determination of potential causes of a system failure </p>

<p>AFD-2: <b>Forecasting</b>: Determination of potential failures associated with a system</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>Ideation Brainstorming</b></font><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p>Ideation Brainstorming is a modification of traditional brainstorming based on
utilization of TRIZSoft&#153; to support team facilitation process. It includes the
following steps:</p>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Preparation to team work session</b></i>, including:

</p><ul>
  <li>Knowledge mapping the problem</li>
  <li>Automatic formulation of problem statements and selection the ones for the team work
    session</li>
  <li>Selection of Operators for team work session</li>
</ul>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Team work session</b></i>, including two stages:

</p><ul>
  <li>Idea generation stage</li>
  <li>Evaluation stage</li>
</ul>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Idea generation stage</b></i> includes generating ideas for selected problem statements
based on selected Operators. The following rules should apply:

</p><ul>
  <li>Everybody should be able to see the computer screen</li>
  <li>Facilitator is guiding team through problem statements and Operators</li>
  <li>Facilitator&#146;s assistant documents all suggestions, questions in the way visible to
    all team members</li>
  <li>Working on one problem statement should take in average from 5 to 15 min.</li>
  <li>Working with one Operators should take no more than 3-5 min.</li>
  <li>Work with a specific problem statement or Operators stops if no more new ideas are
    generated in 1-2 min.</li>
  <li>All critique is forbidden during this session</li>
</ul>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Evaluation stage</b></i> follows the idea generation stage to provide preliminary
evaluation of ideas, unveiling and document secondary problems. During this stage, the
following rules should apply:

</p><ul>
  <li>Utilization of specific questions developed (embedded in the IWB software)</li>
  <li>Limit 5 to 10 min for the session</li>
  <li>Working with the next problem</li>
  <li>If an idea is very valuable, it is possible to move to solving secondary problem(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>When teamwork session is finished, facilitator and his/her assistant organize the
results of the session, build if necessary new knowledge maps and formulate secondary
problems (if any). All suggestions and problems are presented to the next teamwork
session.</p>

<p>Note.</p>

<p>Unlike the traditional brainstorming session when the fantasy of the team members is
quickly exhausted and therefore the productive time is not more than 1-1.5 hour, Ideation
brainstorming may long 3-5 hours with 10 min. break every hour. 10-15 serious problems may
be considered during this time.</font></p>
