<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The polyscreen approach proposed by Genrich Saulovich Altshuller is
used in this paper to discuss a possibility of superconductivity in chalcogenide glasses
and even their melts* at sub-screen, some general ideas in superconductivity at the main
screen, and basic features of doing science at the super-screen. The goals of such
approach are to involve scientists into TRIZ paradigm, to demonstrate TRIZniks the culture
of natural sciences, and to present peculiarities of semiconductor-superconductor
transitions. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The polyscreen approach (sometimes called as the system operator)
allows TRIZniks to compare and predict different stages of evolution of a technical
system. Here it is used for estimation of critical temperatures of the transition into
superconductivity state Tc and development of physics (see the figure 1). To the best of
the author knowledge, it is the first attempt to present results of TRIZ (and even
scientific research) in such form.</p>
<font SIZE="3">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">* Chalcogenide glasses are the wide class of amorphous semiconductors
on the base of elements of VI group of the Mendeleev&#146;s periodic system, e.g., As-S-Se
alloys.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. The Super-Screen: </font><b>SCIENCE</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As it is known, the lists of physical, chemical, etc. effects for
design of new devices and creation of new technologies is the important part of TRIZ
[1,2]. However, TRIZ is very rarely used in purely academic investigations [3] yet and, as
far as we know, there were no attempts to exploit the TRIZ ideas for revealing the new
forms of matter earlier. (It should be noted that investigations of this type are very
rare in scientific practice and their results are compatible with inventions of the 5<sup>th</sup>
level [1,2] in engineering). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Continuity is inherent in most scientific investigations. By continuity
is meant here the perfect authors&#146; knowledge of results of previous investigations
and state of a problem. By the way, that is why the exchange of preprints (papers before
their publication) between scientists is universally accepted in intensively developed
branches of science. This exchange significantly catalyzes the scientific research and
creates the benevolent working atmosphere in association of professionals. Unfortunately,
we lost such milieu in TRIZ in few last years. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Physicist from different countries have participated in the research
presented in this paper &#150; development of superconductors. Although all participants
(except the author) were not familiar with TRIZ at the time of research discussed in this
paper, they often intuitively used some TRIZ ideas. The author of this paper, who
thoroughly has studied all TRIZ literature in 1980-1981 and continuously keeps track of
modern publications, believes that he applies the TRIZ technique at the level of well
inoculated conditioned reflex now. It is simple to track that such TRIZ concepts as the
ideality, sub-systems and resolution of physical contradictions have been used in the
research of superconductivity in non-crystalline materials performed by the author during
last 15 years (some results are presented an the sub-screen). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. The Main Screen: </font><b>SUPERCONDUCTIVITY</b><font SIZE="4"> </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Heike Kamerling Onnes, a physicist from Netherlands, discovered
superconductivity (capability of a material to conduct electricity without resistance) in
mercury cooled by rare and expensive helium below the critical temperature (Tc) 4.2 K in
1911. In spite of discovery of superconductivity in many other materials, the fundamental
theory of their behavior /BCS theory/ was published by the American physicists John
Bardeen, Leon N. Cooper, and J. Robert Schrieffer only in 1957 (see, e.g. [1,2]) . </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The BCS theory is based on the attracting interaction between
electrons, which takes place due to their interaction with phonons /quantum atomic
vibrations that propagate through the whole crystal lattice of a solid body/. In
low-temperature superconductors, these quasi-particles (electrons + vibrations) hinder
phonons to spread such couples and create the force, which overcomes the inter-electron
repulsion. This Cooper&#146;s coupling in the momentum space can occur only when the
temperature T is sufficiently low, so that usual thermal motion of electrons is
diminished. Cooper&#146;s couples avoid collisions resulting in usual resistance.
Electrons have spin equal to 1/2, however their couples will have spin equal to 0 or 1.
This creates prerequisite to their condensation and superfluid in coherent state. Since
the electron pairs carry the electric charge, their superfluidity will be automatically
accompanied with superconductivity just at their formation at some Tc named the critical
temperature of superconductivity transition.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For almost 30 years after creation of the BCS theory, efforts of
thousands physicists and materials scientist built up the Tc value only up to 23 K in
metal alloys, that caused crisis in the research. The BCS theory describes low-temperature
superconductivity in metals and cannot show ways to increase Tc strongly. Nevertheless,
some applications of the low-temperature superconductors have been developed, such as, for
example, high-power magnets, SQUID detectors, devices for image formation (MRI), etc. Due
to high cost (about $10 for gallon) and inconvenience of helium cooling needed to keep
materials in superconductivity state, these and other applications of low-temperature
superconductors were not considered as economical for wide commercial usage [3]. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It becomes clear that high-temperature superconductors must be sought
for beyond the mechanism of BCS theory, hence number of models have been proposed [1,2].
One of the most promises ideas is the theory of superconductivity related to the
Bose-Einstein condensation of local pairs in the coordinate space [4,5]. Such condensation
of quantum particles with integral spin was considered more than 70 years ago by the
Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose and the German (at that time) theorists Albert
Einstein. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Significantly simplifying the situation, we can compare the
Bose-Einstein condensation with gas transition into liquid. Such transition takes place
either at temperature decrease (and consequent decrease of gas kinetic energy) or at
pressure increase (and consequent decrease in distance between gas molecules).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This new state of a matter was discovered in liquid helium at its
transition into the superfluid state. Experiments of the Soviet physicist Pyotr
Leonidovich Kapitza in Great Britain and the American physicists Robert C. Richardson and
David M. Lee in 1938 and 1971 have shown that superfluid property is inherent in both
isotopes of helium. The detailed pattern of this phenomenon was developed by the Soviet
theorists Lev Davidovich Landau.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here our story transforms from the consequent in time to the parallel
one as it usual for polyscreen approach in TRIZ. At this stage, barriers between different
disciplines in physics had an adverse effect on science development because the
specialists in superconductivity and glasses did NOT know works of each other. The
abundance of information about the results of research in natural sciences are published
in many journals in different languages (although, in the case under consideration, the
papers were published in the most readable Soviet and American physical journals) that
make hard to a researcher to find appropriate result from another (even close) field. On
the author&#146;s opinion, the modern Internet WWW technology as well as the detailed and
expanded TRIZ lists of effects can improve this situation. So, let us describe briefly the
decade preceding the discovery of so-called high-temperature superconductivity.</p>

<table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="1" BORDERCOLOR="#000000" CELLPADDING="9">
  <tr>
    <td WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="top"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The American and Great Britain theorists
    Philip W. Anderson and Nevill F. Mott together with the American physicist Robert A.
    Street considered the possibility of existence of local electron pairs in chalcogenide
    glasses in 1975 [6,7]. This theory was experimentally justified by three research groups
    [8] in 1982-1985.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1983-1984, the author of this paper hypothesized that
    superconductivity is possible in chalcogenide glasses alloyed with some transition metals
    with <u>d-shell</u>, which can increase the concentration of the local electron pairs in
    these glasses [9]. It should be noted that a year earlier the model of superconductivity
    at the expense of local pairs was independently developed by the Soviet theorists I.O.
    Kulik, A.G. Pedan (Kharkov, now Turkey), A.S. Alexandrov (Moscow, now Great Britain), and
    the French physicist J. Ranninger [10]. Initially the authors of Ref. 10 did not know
    about existence of the chalcogenide glasses at all, while S.D. Savransky (Novgorod, now
    USA) had no deal with superconductivity and did not know about Ref.10 and the whole idea
    of local pairs superconductivity. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Few days later after the appearance of the hypothesis about
    superconductivity due to the local pairs in chalcogenide glasses, the experiments were
    performed by I. V. Berman and N. B. Brandt (Moscow State University) with V. I. Sidorov
    (AN Institute of High Pressure Physics), in which the superconductivity at <u>high
    pressure P</u> in these materials was discovered [11a]. The first experiment was performed
    with the glass Ge<font SIZE="4"><sub>33</sub></font>As<font SIZE="4"><sub>12</sub></font>Se<font SIZE="4"><sub>55</sub></font> untypical for academic research but widely used for
    submarine windows in USSR Navy, then more simple structures have been studied [11 b,c]. </td>
    <td WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="top"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea of local pairs superconductivity
    was taken into consideration during studies of ceramics in IBM research division in
    Switzerland. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In April 1986 K. Alex Muller and George Bednorz discovered
    superconductivity in the ceramic La<font SIZE="4"><sub>2-x</sub></font>Ba<font SIZE="4"><sub>x</sub></font>CuO<font SIZE="4"><sub>4 </sub></font>at 35 K, which becomes the first high-temperature
    superconductor [3]. During the tests of this sensation result it was found that Tc
    increases as <u>pressure P</u> grows. This fact leaded the group of physicist from the
    University of Houston (USA) to the TRIZ conclusion &#150; instead to increase Tc from
    outside, some atoms should be injected into the material that press the structure from the
    inside (i.e. TRIZ system convolution into substance). Already to the late of 1986, this
    group headed by Paul C. W. Chu overcame the so-called nitrogen limit (the temperature of
    liquefying of readily available and inexpensive nitrogen) at the expense of injection of
    metals with <u>d-shell</u> into the material. The Houston group in co-operation with the
    Chinese physicist M. K. Wu reached the stable and reproducible superconductivity with Tc
    close to 100 K in Y<font SIZE="4"><sub>1</sub></font>Ba<font SIZE="4"><sub>2</sub></font>Cu<font SIZE="4"><sub>3</sub></font>O<font SIZE="4"><sub>7-d</sub></font> in January 1987 [3].</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time regularity of increase in the temperature Tc looks like the
    S-shaped curve well-known in TRIZ with the values 110 K and 125 K for bismuth cuprates
    found in 1988 up to the record Tc = 164 K discovered in mercury compounds under pressure
    in 1993 and further stop in Tc growth at the level more than 100 K below than the room T
    ~300 K [3]. In all cases, superconductivity is caused by alloying of initial matrix of Cu
    and O atoms resulting in change of the electron spectrum.</td>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should be noted that several technical comprehension of this
so-called high-temperature superconductivity only arises recently, and many nice
applications of this phenomena are yet not found. But again, Tc is still too small for
industry.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The attack to the problem of the high-temperature superconductivity is
unprecedented over the whole history of science. Now several hundred of physical,
chemical, and materials research laboratories all over the world are involved in the
studies of the high-temperature superconductivity in ceramics and similar crystals. The
questions arise: </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- does the curve of growth in the temperature of transition into the
superconductor state Tc reach its saturation for cuprate materials ? and </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- is there the necessity to pass to other S-shaped curve (i.e., to a
new class of material) or the period during which the cuprate materials are studied is too
short and new discoveries can be done in this direction? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The author does not undertake to solve these problem and simply calls
attention to unusual regularities of the transition into superconductor state in the
chalcogenide glasses, to the record Tc for sulphur (the highest superconductor transition
temperature have been observed in the single-element materials), and to strange
semiconductor-metal transformation in chalcogenide melts e.g., in selenium [9,11-15].
These results are presented at the figure 2.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. The Sub-Screen: </font><b>SUPERCONDUCTIVITY IN AMORPHOUS AND LIQUID
SELENIUM</b><font SIZE="2"></p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The features of superconducting transition (ST) in the amorphous
selenium (a-Se) [1-5] and other chalcogenide glasses [6,7] that occurs at high pressures P
at low temperatures T cannot be explained by the BCS theory, but describes well by the
local pairs&#146; theory of superconductivity [8,9]. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The existence of local pairs (LP) in disordered Se well fixed [10]. In
the liquid selenium (l-Se) LP create at the chains&#146; ends [10-15] with energy <b>E =
0.14 eV</b> per electron [15]. Let discuss from this point of view experiments shown at
the figures 1 and 2.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LP are frozen in a-Se with the concentration N <sup>~</sup> 1019 cm-3
because the typical chain consists of L = 104-105 atoms [10-14,16]. LP pin the Fermi level
F near middle of the gap Eg and LP binding energy Eb <font SIZE="2"><font FACE="Symbol">»</font>
</font>Eg [10, 15]. Eg reduces from 2.05 eV to 0 in l-Se from the melting point Tm to the
semiconductor - metal transition at Tt <font FACE="Symbol">»</font> 1600K then P <font FACE="Symbol">³</font> 0.5 kbar [14, 17], and dTm/dP <font FACE="Symbol">³</font> 10
grad/kbar in Se [16]. In the linear approximation used here a value dEg(l)/dT <font FACE="Symbol">»</font> 10-3 eV/grad in l-Se that is only 10% of dEg(a)/dP in a-Se
[17-19]. The chain structure of l-Se destroys at Tt but the two-fold coordination
structure is preserved below and above the semiconductor - metal transition in l-Se
[17-20]. The l-Se again returns to an insulating state in the immediate vicinity of the
critical point Tcr in another structural state [17]. The semiconductor - metal transition
shifts to lower T under grown P in l-Se (dTt/dP <font FACE="Symbol">»</font> 100
grad/kbar near 1500 K) [11-14]. The semiconductor - metal transition occurs in a-Se under
high P &gt; 70-100 kbar [1-5,19] when F shifts to the mobility edge Em [3,21]. Since L
reduces in l-Se from ~ 104 atoms at Tm to L = 7-10 atoms near Tt [14,17], so N strongly
increases above 900 K up to NA/L ~ 6.1022 cm-3 at Tt (NA is the Avogadro number). Spin
density is 0.1.NA/L at Tt [14], hence LP exist at this T. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the local pairs&#146; theory of superconductivity [8,14] the
temperature Tc and width dTc of ST is coupled with the Bose-Einstein condensation of LP
with mass M as: </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Tc <sup>~ </sup>N2/3/M, dTc/Tc <sup>~</sup> N4/3. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hence, LP band-width t is:</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">t <sup>~</sup> M1/2(Tc3dTc)1/4lnM. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The parameters of a-Se have been determined [21] on the basis of the
most detailed data [5]. The concentration N is about (1-3).1019 cm-3 at P &lt; 130 kbar,
i.e., all LP taking part in ST, because P destroys Se chains. Mass<b> M</b> lies in range <b>(4-8)</b>.<b>m</b>
at P = 100-110 kbar,<b> m</b> is the free electron mass. Band <b>t</b> is relatively wide <font FACE="Symbol">»</font> 1-10 meV in a-Se at same P [21].</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The kinetic mass of LP at the normal P estimated from M values is ~
800m in a-Se. All characteristics of ST in a-Se correspond to predictions of the local
pairs&#146; theory of superconductivity [21]. With these facts in mind let us show that
l-Se can be the local pairs superconductor.</p>

of possible superconducting state from a region with normal state for P discussed below.
ST could begins from Tl ~ 900 K and ends at Tt for actual M and N. LP unstable at very
high T, so region of ST could ends at Tu = Eg which is ~ 1500 K in l-Se. Since l-Se is a <b>semiconductor</b>

values t ~ (0.2 - 1.6)* Tc<i>. </i>The white superconducting region is limited by Pl and
Pu, Tu and Tl the boundary solid - liquid metal at T ~ 1050 - 1120 K, so for actual <b>t</b>
the necessary P lie below 60 kbar in superconducting l-Se. The lines that are shown for
different <b>to =t/Tc</b> values indicate the low T and high P limits in this region for
ST due to LP.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another possibility to increase of N is connected with destruction of
Se chains by impurities (e.g., Te, As, K, Cl). Moreover, some impurities can create own LP
in a- and l-Se [10]. Then the distance between neighbor LP decreases, so t increases and M
decreases. Probably the conditions for ST can be softened in l-Se doped by these elements,
and in other melts of chalcogenide glasses with small energy E.</p>

values of parameters, but probably do not change the main conclusion that<b> LP
superconductivity is possible in liquid Selenium and some other liquid chalcogenide alloys

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. Conclusion</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The possibility of existence of a new form of matter - liquid
high-temperature superconductors in melts of chalcogenide glasses - is predicted.
Undoubtedly, the liquid high-temperature superconductors will give rise to many
inventions, for example, in magneto-hydrodynamic propulsive agents.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also shown that openess of researches from different countries
leads to progress in science. Many names mentioned above were awarded with Nobel prize
(Heike Kamerling Onnes, John Bardeen, Leon N. Cooper, J. Robert Schrieffer, Satyendra Nath
Bose, Albert Einstein, Pyotr Kapitza, Lev Davidovich Landau, Philip W. Anderson, Nevill F.
Mott, K. Alex Muller and George Bednorz). Nobel prize &quot;waits&quot; also for a
scientist, who will be successful in explanation of superconductivity in Y<font SIZE="4"><sub>1</sub></font>Ba<font SIZE="4"><sub>2</sub></font>Cu<font SIZE="4"><sub>3</sub></font>O<font SIZE="4"><sub>7-d</sub></font>
and other cuprates, as well as the one who will find the superconductivity at temperature
above the room one. Although thousands of papers are published about the high-temperature
superconductivity, the mechanism of this phenomenon is still unclear. Maybe the reason is
that physicists, chemists, and specialists in materials do not know TRIZ (?). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the author would like to note again that the open
information exchange between scientists from different countries and continents is actual
for TRIZ now in order to become a genuine science. </p>
