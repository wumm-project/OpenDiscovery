<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This article is a continuation of a column that was begun in December
1998.<small><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></small><a name="1a"></a> This column is about my
personal journey through the TRIZ education process.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Invention Machine Corporation<small><sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></small><a name="2a"></a> training was held in Los Angeles California in 1996 and was primarily
focused on their TechOptimizer<font FACE="Symbol">Ô</font> software product. During the
class I was introduced to the basic theory of contradiction matrix theory for the first
time. The Principles module of the software allows the user to define a problem (using
contradiction identification) by contrasting a parameter from the existing 39 parameters
as defined by Altshuller that improves with a parameter (again, from the 39) that degrades<small><sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></small><a name="3a"></a>. This contrasting of parameters yields
several principles, with examples, the user may use to stimulate concept generation. I
found the examples to be extremely useful because the reduction of the principle to a
concept can be difficult when the intent of the principle is not evident to the problem
solver. The utilization of examples assists in the performance of the required analogous
thinking required. The explanation of this tool and performing some exercises in the class
were beneficial as an introduction to the foundational work of Altshuller&#146;s
contradiction matrix theory. The Prediction module was introduced as a method of
introducing alternative substances into or around an existing system. It wasn&#146;t
obvious to me at the time but it is now clear that the prediction module is based on the
work of Altshuller in the area of the evolution of technical systems. Dr. Domb points out
this strong correlation in her training materials that refer to the prediction tree and
the evolution of technical systems. The Effects module is a collection of scientific
phenomena that can be used as a fund to find alternative methods of performing a required
technical function. This effect fund is analogous to the collection of effects found in
Creativity as an Exact Science, Appendix 3<small><sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></small><a name="4a"></a>. The Function Analysis module allows the user to create a model
demonstrating the functions of components as well as their interactions. The basis for
this module is strongly related to value engineering but it is a strong connection to the
TRIZ tools employed by the software as it allows the user to eliminate components from
their system (trimming) which allows the system to migrate towards the ideal state (ideal
final result, IFR)<sup><small><a href="#5">5</a></small></sup><a name="5a"></a>. This
process invariably yields problems associated with this migration towards ideality and it
keeps track of these complications. The software then allows the user to apply the modules
toward reaching resolution of these complications. The software uses a value engineering
based function module as an entry point for the application of the TRIZ tools that are
present. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The interrelationship of these tools is vital for a thorough
understanding of fundamental TRIZ theory and the IMC software and training class is
adequate for this demonstration. It is this researchers opinion that an in depth
understanding of the underlying principles of TRIZ is necessary for the optimum
utilization of these software tools. It is with this in mind that I pursued the next step
in my TRIZ education process. Before I go on, let us review the associated variables
reflecting the intent and modis operandi of the training I have discussed. The materials
(class notes, software manual, examples, lecture notes) were created by members of
Invention Machine Corporation under the ultimate direction of Dr. Tsourikov who was
trained in TRIZ by Dr. Altshuller. I think it is important to distinguish this fact as it
supports the implications of strong TRIZ theoretical reliance for the problem solving
modules discussed above. This supports my conjecture that a complete knowledge and
understanding of TRIZ principles is crucial to their optimum application. The materials
were created to support the use of the software and ultimately this is what the materials
are best at. I would not use the materials as a stand-alone text for the learning of TRIZ
principles but as a strong supporting text for the application of the tools embodied in
the software. As a first exposure, for me, the software was perfect. It allowed me to
explore the ramifications of all possible selections (principles, effects, prediction
tree, function modeling) and their interdependent relationships. My desire for fundamental
theoretical knowledge grew from the application of the software in the resolution of
several problems<sup><small><a href="#6">6</a></small></sup><a name="6a"></a>. For many
students I believe an understanding of the theory should preclude the introduction to the
software. Several conversations<sup><small><a href="#7">7</a></small></sup><a name="7a"></a>
with experienced TRIZ practitioners helped to elucidate any points of application that
were not clear to me at the time. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 3<sup>rd</sup> Annual Total Product Development Symposium was the
next event I attended that had significant TRIZ content. I was able to witness several
TRIZ lectures from practitioners as well as evaluate the proceedings. Reviewing the
application of various portions of the TRIZ methodology increased the depth of my
understanding. Listening to presentations by Dr. Domb, V. Fey, Z. Royzen, and D. Verduyn
was vital for the transition from introductory awareness to ability to apply the tools at
the most complex levels (my prior work, although successful, did not apply all the
available TRIZ tools). This scientific forum was conducive to the strengthening of the
methodology and I would propose the continuation of this type of intellectual transfer as
it will support the development of the TRIZ methodology as its&#146; acceptance propagates
throughout the world. After these events I attended advanced training in Boston at
Invention Machine under the direction of Dr. Ikovenko. The material presented during this
class as well as my training under D. Clark, B. Zlotin, and A. Zusman will be discussed in
the next article of this series.</p>
