<p align="JUSTIFY">INTRODUCTION</p>
</font></b><font size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Russian initiated Theory of Inventive Problem Solving
(TRIZ) (1, 2) and those aspects of the Theory implemented in software (3) have
begun to penetrate deeply into the development departments of leading,
innovative organisations and educational establishments.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Both method and software may be exploited by engineers and
scientists during the formulation and solution of technically innovative
problems across a truly generic spectrum of technical products, systems and
processes.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Problem formulation - often thought to be the most difficult
aspect of the innovation process - may be considerably eased through
exploitation of the analytical parts of TRIZ; in particular those methods
associated with the Russian algorithm for inventive problem solving (ARIZ). In
TRIZ-based software, this has been implemented as Function Analysis modules.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Problem solution is greatly assisted through the synthesising
parts of TRIZ and its implementation in the software as, scientific effects
knowledge-base, Contradictions and Trends of Evolution modules.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The paper discusses the power of both analytical - problem
formulation - and synthesising - problem solving - aspects of TRIZ and Computer
Aided Innovation tools through use of a case study example from the field of
heat exchanger design. In particular, the paper demonstrates how TRIZ was used
successfully to break out of existing heat exchanger conceptual paradigms to
produce a novel design solution which is now the subject of patent CZ 280 320 B6
(4).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The work on heat exchangers has also raised a number of
points regarding how the method may best be taught and used within the education
system. A final section in the paper discusses such points in the context of
emerging education process paradigms for the next century.</p>

<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">HEAT EXCHANGER COMPONENT ANALYSIS</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The paper will concentrate on application of some of the key
TRIZ and TRIZ-based software tools and techniques to a real life heat exchanger
design example. The heat exchanger is illustrated schematically in Figure 1.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The basic heat exchanger under consideration consists of a
mantle, pipes, pipewall supporting pipes, a pipewall movement compensator
(necessary in order to take into account pipe dilation effects), and two
internal hangers to provide appropriate support to the pipes. The heat exchanger
is of the transverse-flow type such that, as shown in the figure, the heating
medium enters the mantle at M1 and departs at m1. The heated medium enters the
system of pipes at m2 and flows out at M2.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><img border="1" src="99dec_4.gif" width="557" height="300"><br>
Figure 1: Heat Exchanger Arrangement</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In order to identify possible improvements to this basic
system, the analytical steps of TRIZ begin with the definition of a functional
model of the heat exchanger. In the case of the Invention Machine®
TechOptimizer implementation, the method combines the S-Field and Standard
Inventive Solutions of TRIZ (1, 2) with the pioneering value engineering
thinking of Miles (5).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In both cases, the analysis is based on qualitative
descriptions of the relationships between the individual components of the
overall system. It collects information about the positive and negative aspects
of these inter-component relationships in the form:-</p>
<p align="CENTER">SUBJECT </font><font face="Monotype Sorts" size="2">Ù</font><font size="2">
ACTION </font><font face="Monotype Sorts" size="2">Ù</font><font size="2">
OBJECT</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In each relationship, it is necessary to classify the action
in terms of helpful or harmful, insufficient-satisfactory or excessive,
directional (one-way, both ways), and time based (continuous, periodic, etc)
function. Of primary importance are Function Type and Function Rank
descriptions.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In TRIZ terms, Function Types are categorised as either
Basic, Additional, Auxiliary or Harmful. Likewise, Function Ranks can be
Insufficient, Satisfactory or Excessive.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For the heat exchanger, for example, looking at the mantle
and the heating medium M1, we might observe that the functional connection
between subject and object is ‘conducts’. I.e.</p>
<p align="CENTER">MANTLE </font><font face="Monotype Sorts" size="2">Ù</font><font size="2">
CONDUCTS </font><font face="Monotype Sorts" size="2">Ù</font><font size="2"> M1</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In terms of Function Type, we might chose to classify this
relationship as ‘Auxiliary’ as the transmission of the heating medium of the
heating medium through the mantle is subordinate to the basic purpose of the
exchanger - which is to transfer heat to ‘m2’.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Regarding Function Rank, in this case we will chose to
classify the mantle-M1 relationship as ‘Satisfactory’. In other cases - for
example - if the heat exchanger was suffering from excessive pressure loss of
the M1 fluid as it passes through the mantle, we might have chosen to classify
the interaction as ‘Insufficient’ or ‘Excessive’.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">So, for this particular relationship we have established that
the mantle conducts M1 satisfactorily, and that the relationship is auxiliary to
the main function of the overall system.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The task of defining these relationships is a vital aspect of
the problem formulation process. It is also perhaps the most difficult part.
Newcomers to the method may even find it quite un-natural. This is particularly
so with respect to the appropriate definition of the ACTION part of the
relationship because there are often distinct differences between the language
of everyday use and the language of function analysis.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">An important rule to help establish whether the action is
appropriately defined is to ensure that it <b>changes or preserves something
about the object</b>.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For example, ‘M1 - heats - pipes’ is an appropriate
function definition because the action ‘heats’ does change the object ‘pipes’
- i.e. ‘temperature’ changes.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, a relationship like ‘compensator
protects pipewall’ is not a valid one because the action ‘protects’ does
not change any parameter concerning the pipewall. ‘Protects’ is very much
the language of everyday use. In functional analysis language, the relationship
between compensator and pipewall is far better described as ‘compensator
releases pipewall’ for now the action does change a parameter relating to the
pipewall.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There are many actions like ‘protects’ - such as ‘improves’,
or ‘seals’, or ‘lubricates’ - which we have to re-think quite
considerably when we are performing function analyses.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Similarly, there can also be problems adequately defining
subjects and objects adequately: ‘heat exchanger heats m2’ for example is
valid from the perspective of an action which changes something about the
object, but from the perspective of wishing to improve the design of a heat
exchanger, is of very little value. Altshuller often talked about super-systems
and sub-systems and the importance of establishing the right balance between the
different levels within a function model. Others (6, 7) often define a problem
in terms of a highly layered problem hierarchy. Pitching the function analysis
model at the ‘right’ level - i.e. the level which will allow the problem at
hand to be solved - remains a difficult aspect of TRIZ and software
implementations. Meanwhile, Table 1 shows each of the key functional
relationships defined for the heat exchanger case study.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><img border="0" src="99dec_5.gif" width="606" height="300"><br>
Table 1: Key Functional Relationships For Heat Exchanger</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Adequate definition of the Table is a challenging and
time-consuming process. Construction of a supporting component relationship
model (Figure 2) can often provide an important aid and ensure that all relevant
inter-component relationships are systematically considered.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Table highlights the function ‘pipes heat m2’ as the
basic function of the heat exchanger. I.e. the main purpose of the device is to
transfer heat to the m2 medium. ‘m2’ in its heated form is the ‘product’
of the exchanger. Note also that the function has been ranked as ‘insufficient’
in this example.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Each of the functional definitions where there is one of
these ‘insufficient’ or ‘excessive’ or ‘harmful’ actions represents
the formulation of a distinct problem to be solved. <b>Effective identification
of all such ‘negative’ functional relationships within a system is essential
to the successful deployment of TRIZ Function Analysis methods.</p>

Figure 2: Heat Exchanger Relational Model</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For the case study heat exchanger, the functional model and
Table have together provided a number of important problem definitions:-</p>
<b>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Increasing the Basic Function Rank: </b>how might the
    action ‘heat m2’ be intensified? (NB includes both heat transfer from
    M1-to-pipes and pipes-to-m2)</li>
<b>
<li>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Elimination of Undesirable Effects:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
</b>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">how to prevent (or how to avoid the consequences) of the
    pipe elongation when temperatures change?</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">how to prevent the pipewall motion inside the mantle as
    temperatures in the exchanger vary? (NB: the consequence is currently
    eliminated by the compensator)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">how to prevent pipe vibration? (NB vibration currently
    eliminated by the hangers)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Recognising that consumers are, generally speaking, more
interested in product function than the product itself, it follows that if it is
possible to achieve a given function without a corresponding component, the
overall system will benefit. This benefit usually takes the form of a lower cost
of production.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This idea of improving the system by preserving the function
while removing components was one of the product evolution trends observed by
Altshuller’s team (1) and as such may be found in both the trend known as ‘Trimming’
and in his thinking relating to long term product development strategy and the
Ideal Final Result concept - where it is very common to envision the IFR of a
product to be precisely that it does perform the product function without the
presence of the product.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The idea of maintaining (or indeed increasing) functionality
while reducing part count (and hence usually cost) is also very much at the
foundation of the work on value engineering pioneered by Miles (5).</p>
<b></b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Central to the value engineering model is the ‘value’ or
‘ideality’ parameter, defined as:-</p>
<b>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Value = Benefits/ (Penalties + Costs)</p>
</blockquote>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The model states that there is an evolutionary trend towards
increasing 'value’. Each of the trends observed by Altshuller and his team -
including the ‘Trimming’ trend - may be seen to be consistent with this
over-riding, global value trend.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Product and Process Analysis sections of the
TechOptimizer code are in effect an amalgamation of Miles’ value engineering
approach and TRIZ’s systematic analysis approach. Figure 3 illustrates the
product analysis model created using the software for the heat exchanger case
study.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Consistent with Miles’ inclusion of a ‘cost’ parameter
within the ‘value’ definition, the TechOptimizer implementation also allows
the user to specify component cost data. When suggesting ways to improve the
system, the software uses this data to help rank and prioritise the individual
problems in terms of their net individual effect on the overall system.</p>

Figure 3: TechOptimizer Model of Exchanger</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In this particular case, the overall ‘value’ calculations
indicated that trimming of first the compensator and second the hangers would be
most beneficial to the overall exchanger design. In other words, looking back to
the previously formulated problems, we should look first at how we might how to
prevent the pipewall motion inside the mantle if the compensator is eliminated,
and second, we should look at how we might prevent pipe vibration if the hangers
are eliminated.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">With the function analysis model, we have thus been able to
analyse, formulate and prioritise the problems that require solving. We are now
in a position to move forward and look at using some of TRIZ’s synthesising
techniques to generate inventive problem solutions.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">ALGORITHM FOR INVENTIVE PROBLEM SOLVING (ARIZ)</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">TRIZ is a working procedure for the systematic formulation
and solution of inventive problems. The primary synthesising tool of TRIZ, ARIZ,
is a tactical chain of thinking tools, which together form a clear, identifiable
process through problem solutions will emerge. We have previously seen stages 1,
2 and 3 of ARIZ during the problem formulation, creation of a function analysis
model and analysis of the model. We will concentrate here on the subsequent
problem solving aspects of TRIZ. In these parts of TRIZ, the designer is guided
through the solution process from Technical and Physical Contradictions, through
to construction and use of Altshuller and team’s Standard Principles of
Solution.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">All of these methods can be seen described in Altshuller’s
key text (1), numerous examples to be found in TRIZ Journal and elsewhere
(7-11), and in the text by Salamatov (2). We will concentrate instead on the
application of the ARIZ tools to the heat exchanger problem.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Technical Contradictions</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Here we are searching for instances where as we try to
improve some feature of the design, another aspect becomes worse. An example may
be found in the Figure 3 function model if we look at the M1-vibrates-Pipes part
of the model. The vibration is a harmful action adversely affecting the
stability of the pipes. Typically, we fit hangers to try and control this
stability problem. But, as can be seen from the Function Model segment
illustrated in Figure 4, as we introduce the hangers to cure one problem, we
have then introduced the problem of hangers impeding the flow of M1.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This is clearly a technical contradiction. Attempts to
improve device <b>stability</b> result in a worsened <b>energy loss</b>. The
specifics of this problem correlate directly to the generic contradiction
parameters defined by Altshuller in his Contradiction Matrix. It is thus
possible to directly look-up in the Matrix how other problem solvers have
inventively eliminated similar stability - energy loss conflicts.</p>

Figure 4: Hanger-Pipe-M1 Interaction Model</p>
</font></b><font size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Matrix suggests the following Inventive Principles:-</p>
<i>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Curvature Increase - </i>e.g. transformation from 2D
    surface to 3D space, from lines to curves. This Principle suggests the
    hangers might take a different cross-sectional form in order to reduce M1
    flow resistance.</li>
<i>
<li>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Separation</i> - interpreted, for example, to mean
  separating the positive effect of the hangers from their negative effect -
  e.g. to find another carrier that is able to strengthen the pipes.</li>
<i>
<li>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Multi</i>-<i>Functionality</i>/<i>Universality</i> -
  interpreted in this case to mean increasing the functionality of the pipes
  such that they take on the function of the hangers.</li>
</ul>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"></font><font size="2">
<p align="left">A second technical contradiction exists regarding the desire to
increase the heat transfer from M1 to the pipes and from the pipes to m2 -
Figure 5.</p>
<b>
<p align="CENTER"><img border="0" src="99dec_10.gif" width="278" height="58"><br>
Figure 5: M1-Pipe-m2 Interaction Model</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The technical contradiction here is perhaps less easy to see
from the Function Model, but one exists nevertheless. In attempting to improve
heat transfer from either M1 or to m2, the usual method of achieving the
improvement is to increase the <b>area</b> of the heat exchange surface. In
other words, we achieve the improvement in heat transfer at the expense of
increased physical size.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Translating this specific contradiction to the generic
elements of the Contradiction Matrix, we see that the Contradiction exists
between <b>area</b> and a<b> linear dimension</b>. The Matrix then suggests the
Inventive Principles:-</p>
<i>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Copying - </i>interpreted as exploring possibilities
    relating to use of multiple (smaller) exchangers, and/or a greater number of
    smaller pipes.</li>
<i>
<li>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Nested Doll - </i>interpreted as the well known heat
  exchanger design principle of locating pipes within pipes in the mantle.</li>
<i>
<li>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Preliminary Counter-action - </i>interpreted as introducing
  moves to perform an action against the undesirable effect - e.g. the pipes
  should be ‘shortened’ to reduce constructional length, while still aiming
  to increase surface area.</li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Note: Use of a Function Analysis model - as in Figure 3 - to
help identify contradictions is an often powerful problem identification method,
albeit one which is currently not immediately apparent from the software
implementation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Physical Contradictions</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Physical Contradictions are present when we have
contradictory requirements of a single design parameter within the same
component or system.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For example, in the heat exchanger, there is a first physical
contradiction associated with the pipes -where we require them to be both <b>connected</b>
in order to prevent vibration, <b>and</b> to be <b>disconnected</b> in order to
reduce resistance of the M1 flow.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A second physical contradiction relating to the pipes also
exists, in that we require them to be both <b>long </b>in order to have large
heat exchange area, <b>and</b> to be <b>short</b> in order to reduce the overall
dimensions of the heat exchanger.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Physical Contradictions are often the most difficult to solve
- which may help to explain why many designers prefer to use ‘traditional’
design trade-off techniques rather than attempt to eliminate the contradiction.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Altshuller’s team, however, did identify a number of means
of systematically solving Physical Contradictions:-</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">separation of the contradictory requirements in <b>time </b>(e.g.
    pipes connected when flow conditions are close to resonance, and
    disconnected when flow conditions are normal - assuming, of course, that
    both conditions don’t occur at the same time)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">separation of the contradictory requirements in <b>space</b>
    (e.g. pipes are connected in some places and free in others)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">alterations to the system structure (e.g. the pipes may
    be ‘connected’ by M1 to prevent vibration, but also sufficiently
    disconnected to allow resistance-free flow of M1, or, the pipes may be made
    ‘long’ and ‘short’ by making them non-linear).</li>

  <p align="JUSTIFY">Standard Inventive Solutions</p>
</b></font><font size="2" color="#000000">
<p align="JUSTIFY">Altshuller and his team have conducted much work on what he
called S-Fields (1, 2). S-Fields are an attempt to generate a systematic and
universal language for the definition and solution of problems.</p>
</font><font size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">In effect, the S-Field method represents a way of classifying
different problem types in terms of both the number of interacting components
(Substances) and the actions (Fields) which act upon them. TRIZ researchers have
classified the different combinations of Substances and Fields possible and
subsequently identified Standard Inventive Solutions which may be applied to
solve any given Substance-Field combination. In all, 76 such Standard Inventive
Solutions have been determined; any three or four of which are most likely to be
relevant to a given combination type.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The best way to begin to understand the workings of S-Field
analysis is to look at an example. Let us look at the ‘M1 heats Pipes’
relationship which was earlier identified as an ‘insufficient action’ in the
heat exchanger system. In S-Field terms, this relationship may be drawn as:</p>
</font><font face="CG Times"></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="99dec_11.gif" width="191" height="128"></p>
</font><font size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">Where S1 and S2 represent the two substances ‘M1’ and ‘Pipes’,
F represents a thermal field, and the dashed line signifies that the interaction
between the two substances is insufficient.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Standard Inventive Solutions recommended for this S-Field
class then include:-</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Modification of S1 - e.g. use of working fluid with
    improved specific heat and/or viscosity characteristics</li>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"></font><font size="2">
<li>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Modification of S2 - e.g. use of different pipe materials,
  different pipe shape, different surface finish (e.g. introduction of local
  turbulence-generating geometry features).</li>
<li>
  <p align="left">Introduction of an additional Field - e.g. introduction of a
  mechanical field - alter the M1 flow conditions by introducing a swirling
  flow, increase flow rate to ensure turbulent rather than laminar flow,
  introduce a heat transfer enhancing vibration force.<br>
  <img border="0" src="99dec_12.gif" width="317" height="92"></li>
<li>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Introduction of a Modified Substance - e.g. add a substance
  to the fluid M1 in order to increase Field effects</li>
</ol>
</font><font face="CG Times"></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<blockquote>
  <p><img border="0" src="99dec_13.gif" width="333" height="92"></p>
</blockquote>
</font><font size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">The first three Solutions are commonly employed in a variety
of forms in many heat exchanger designs - including the design derived in this
paper. The fourth solution family is perhaps less immediately obvious, but, by
way of illustration, the TechOptimizer Effects module includes the description
of a (patented) heat exchanger concept which sees the introduction of magnetic
particles into the working fluid - which are then caused to move relative to the
fluid through use of a moving magnetic field. The particulate motion causes a
localised increase in working fluid turbulence level and thus creates an
increase in heat transfer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Effects</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Altshuller placed strong emphasis on the collation and
categorisation of physical, chemical and mathematical effects in mankind’s sum
knowledge base. By categorising such effects in terms of their function, he
generated the idea for a very powerful database. The database has perhaps been
most potently implemented in the TechOptimizer software - which now contains
close to 6000 known effects and examples, and continues to grow.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Classification by function means that if we have a problem
like the one in the heat exchanger where we wish to improve the insufficient
action ‘pipes heat m2’, we are able to do so quickly by examining functions
related to the action ‘heat’. For example looking up the function ‘improve
thermal conductivity’ in the Effects database, we are able to very quickly
establish which effects may be relevant to the specific problem at hand.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Chances are that a good heat exchanger designer may know
around a handful of thermal conductivity or heat transfer enhancing effects, and
may be willing or able to use only two or three. The TechOptimizer software is
able to direct the designer to many more (Table 2):-</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">What follows is a brief description of the heat exchanger
improvements resulting from the above analyses, now patented in Czech patent CZ
280 320 B6 by inventor Msc D Sykora (3).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A schematic illustration of the new heat exchanger is given
in Figure 6</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In simple terms, the analyses have permitted the elimination
of two significant components of the exchanger - the compensator and the hangers
- by transfer of the useful functions they performed to other components within
the system. In addition, the basic function of the exchanger has been improved,
two auxiliary functions have been improved, and four undesirable effects have
been reduced or eliminated.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The following points relating to the heat exchanger design
are also worth noting:-</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The hangers have been eliminated by making the heating
    surfaces of the exchanger self-supporting. Elimination of the hangers has
    also meant a reduction in (non-useful) resistance to the flow of the heating
    medium. The internal velocity and temperature fields are homogenous.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Overall strength is ensured through multi-point, mutual
    contact of the helical pipes. Vibration is decreased and expected exchanger
    life is consequently increased.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Increased local flow turbulence in and around the helical
    pipes has created a substantial increase in heat transfer coefficient - thus
    permitting either a 2x improvement in heat exchanger effectiveness, a 2x
    reduction in heating surface required, or a combination of the two benefits.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The new homogenous heating surface of the helical pipes
    is self-compensating in terms of handling relative growth and shrinkage
    between the pipe nest and the mantle.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The increased turbulence of the heating medium decreases
    the localised blocking of the heating surface by impurities and
    contaminants.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The pipe nest forms a highly compact design and so the
    overall heat exchanger volume may be significantly reduced.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The combined effects of 3) and 6) mean opportunities for
    a decrease in the volume of the surrounding facilities.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">When vertically oriented, steam condensation occurring in
    inter-pipe spaces further intensifies the heat transfer effect.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The new, shorter, more compact vertical exchanger with
    the steam condensation mentioned above is more flexible and more responsive
    to changes in heat output demand.</li>

<p align="JUSTIFY">TRIZ AND ENGINEERING EDUCATION</p>
</font></b><font size="2">
<p align="JUSTIFY">Courses in the theory and application of TRIZ are beginning
to emerge in a number of University syllabi across the world.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When he was teaching and writing about TRIZ, Altshuller
placed special emphasis on the need for students to spend as much time as
possible actively involved in the use of the TRIZ methods. All taught material
needs to be backed up with the provision of extensive case study and tutorial
materials. A typical basic final year engineering course may typically comprise
40 to 50 hours of lecture material coupled to at least as much time again for
students to practice using TRIZ on case study exercises and problems. More
advanced courses will typically then need to place even greater emphasis on
practical application of the various tools and techniques.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is perhaps too early to generalise on the most appropriate
means to teach TRIZ due to a variety of cultural and technological differences
between nations. A number of important common themes, however, are probably
worth noting:-</p>
<b></b>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">TRIZ is complementary to a number of innovative tools and
    strategies developed outside of Russia. A well-balanced course should take
    due account of these methods. The world is still some considerable way away
    from a coherent cradle-to-grave systematic innovation approach. The
    following tools and strategies, however, have already been seen to offer a
    high degree of potential for integration with TRIZ:-<br>
    <br>
    <b>Edward de Bono - </b>the father of lateral thinking has published widely
    on the subject. Offering students an appreciation of some of de Bono’s
    work is a commonly used way of introducing the general ideas and mind-sets
    required for effective creativity.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Quality Function Deployment (QFD)</b> - much potential for working up
    front of, or in conjunction with TRIZ in terms of problem definition - in
    particular establishing customer requirements.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Robust Design -</b> Taguchi based methods most usefully applied in the
    area between TRIZ and downstream detail design methods. Some investigators
    (12) have suggested that QFD plus TRIZ plus Robust Design together form an
    extremely potent whole.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Design For Manufacture/Design For Assembly -</b> methodology first
    proposed by Boothroyd (13) to help designers to better understand the
    economic implications of the design decisions they make. The methodology is
    highly complementary to the TRIZ ‘Trimming’ evolutionary trend.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) -</b> technique for allowing
    users to make legitimate ‘apples and oranges’ comparisons between
    different parameters affecting a particular design. Potentially significant
    common ground between TRIZ and MCDA with respect to conducting trade-offs
    between alternative TRIZ solutions.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Axiomatic Design -</b> based around the work conducted by Suh (14).
    Axiomatic design is a technique by which users are able to assess the
    overall merit of TRIZ-generated conceptual solutions. This work is at a
    relatively immature stage, but institutions already teaching axiomatic
    design methods may well find that some integration with TRIZ offers
    significant benefits.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) -</b> a powerful method for
    assisting in the desire to achieve design of reliable products. See also the
    complementary bottom-up inductive failure analysis methods (15), and the
    TRIZ-related Anticipated Failure Determination methodology (16).</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Psychological Inertia is a phenomenon which is highly
    disruptive to the creative process. Making students aware of both the
    phenomenon and how TRIZ is able to offer systematic means for helping to
    remove it is an important step before practical exercises are instigated
    (17).</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">As may be seen in the heat exchanger example, there are
    often several non-instinctive aspects to the language and use of Function
    Analysis and other aspects of TRIZ. Practice with as many case studies as is
    practicable is the only reliable means of exposing students to special case
    uses of the methods. Broad ranging exposure to case study examples is also
    important from an ‘analogies’ perspective. ‘Analogies’ are a
    commonly used strategy for enabling students to convert TRIZ generic
    solutions into the specifics of cases related to their own circumstances.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">TRIZ software can provide the basis for a potent
    educational tool. Experience has found that TRIZ teaching is generally more
    effective if students understand the manual processes of TRIZ before they
    become exposed to the software: ‘<b>effective use demands effective users’</b>.
    This is particularly the case in relation to the Principles and Predictions
    aspects of, for example, the Invention Machine software. Some courses
    currently make no use of software, while others are beginning to use it
    progressively more as an integral part of formal lecture material. There is
    as yet insufficient experiential evidence to propose firm guidelines at this
    stage, although it is perhaps worth making specific mention of the Effects
    database contained within the TechOptimizer software; for this is an
    undoubtedly powerful knowledge source for all students.</li>
