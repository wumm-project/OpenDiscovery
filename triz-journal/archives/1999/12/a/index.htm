<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
</b>
<p>This article is the first in what will be a series of articles examining
connections between TRIZ and the solution of problems involving contradictions
found in the business world.</p>
<p>Here we will be looking at the work of B Joseph Pine II, and his discoveries
surrounding the widespread business trend towards ‘mass customization’ (1).
This apparently paradoxical term - relating to a need for organizations to
create large output of individual product solutions - implies a potential for
considerable commonality with the Contradiction solving methods and strategies
found in TRIZ.</p>
<p>The article aims to answer three key questions:-</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Is the Contradiction Matrix able to predict or reproduce the
    contradiction-eliminating solutions identified by Pine in his book?</li>
  <li>Do Pine’s solutions have anything to offer the TRIZ problem solving
    methods?</li>
  <li>Does TRIZ have anything to offer organizations and researchers involved in
    Mass Customization projects above and beyond the solution strategies found
    in Pine’s book?</li>
</ol>
<p>Beyond these questions, a final section of the article will examine the Mass
Customization phenomenon in relation to a generic pattern of business evolution
trends, and establish possible connections with Altshuller’s discoveries
concerning evolution of technical systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>MASS CUSTOMIZATION</p>
</b>
<p>Mass Customization is all about the (economically viable) mass production of
individually customized goods and services. In his book, Joe Pine describes five
basic methods by which organizations can achieve mass customization:-</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Customization of services around standardized products and services</li>
  <li>Creation of customizable products and services</li>
  <li>Provision of ‘point of delivery’ customization</li>
  <li>High responsiveness throughout the value chain</li>
  <li>Modularization of components to customize end products and services</li>
</ol>
<p>Pine also discusses four innovations which further help to eliminate the ‘mass’
and ‘customized’ contradiction within an organization:-</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Just-in-time (JIT) delivery</li>
  <li>Reduction of set-up and change-over times</li>
  <li>Reduction of cycle times throughout the value chain</li>
  <li>Production based on <i>orders</i> and not <i>forecasts</li>
  </ol>
</i>
<p>Each of the methods and innovations apply to different stages in what Pine
describes as the key links in an organization’s value chain (Figure 1):</p>

their possible connection to TRIZ Inventive Principles.</p>

<p>While concentrating only on the ‘most likely’ Inventive Principles (as
opposed to ‘all’) in each case, it is clear that all of the techniques
required to achieve ‘Mass Customization’ are to be found within the current
set of Inventive Principles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>A TRIZ PERSPECTIVE</p>
</b>
<p>Having been derived specifically for use in solving technical problems, the
39 generic parameters which make up the Matrix will, likely as not, require
considerable modification in order to be relevant to business-type problems.
This modification looks set to require a fairly long and arduous period of
research effort. In the meantime, however, ‘Mass Customization’ offers a
contradiction which does appear to fit quite elegantly into the existing Matrix
structure.</p>
<p>In TRIZ terms, then, ‘Mass Customization’ involves the search to improve
the ADAPTABILITY &amp; VERSATILITY of a product or service to suit the needs of
a particular individual. As adaptability and versatility are improved,
PRODUCTIVITY tends to get worse - i.e. as manufacture quantities tend towards
one, it becomes progressively more difficult to achieve economically viable
production.</p>
<p>According to the Contradiction Matrix, inventors working with technical
problems have most commonly used the following Inventive Principles to solve
ADAPTABILITY &amp; VERSATILITY versus PRODUCTIVITY problems:-</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(35) Parameter Changes<br>
  (28) Mechanics Substitution<br>
  (6) Universality<br>
  (37) Thermal Expansion</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The list bears only occasional resemblance to the table of Inventive
Principles suggested from Pine’s work. ‘Parameter Changes’ (or rather the
‘change consistency’ or ‘change degree of flexibility’ parts of
Parameter Changes) is used quite frequently, ‘Universality’ once, and ‘Mechanics
Substitution’ and ‘Thermal Expansion’ not at all.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between current Matrix suggestions and the suggestions made
in the Mass Customization text, suggests that a ‘Business Contradiction Matrix’
will be markedly different to the current Matrix, at least in terms of this one
contradiction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is perhaps worthwhile in examining whether the
Inventive Principles suggested by the current Matrix have anything of value to
offer to the Mass Customization problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Mechanics Substitution - </b>as interpreted in Reference 3, the idea of
replacing a mechanical entity with sensory means or a field, potentially has
much to offer organisations interested in shifting to a Mass Customized method
of doing business. At the most basic level, this is so because replacement of a
physical entity with a sensory or field alternative means implies significant
reductions in manufacture cost.</p>
<p>At a more detailed level, we might see the inbuilt user customizability of
commercial word-processing software packages as an example of how substitution
of a hard-wired system for user specifiable settings built into (no physical
cost) software is an excellent means of achieving economically viable,
mass-customized products. Similarly with the shift from mechanical to electronic
based camera systems; let the software allow the customer to customize the
camera operation to their own personal requirements.</p>
<p>Looking at ‘fields’ from the manufacturer perspective, as in Pine’s
Levi Strauss case study, laser and ultrasonic measurement systems are much
faster, more accurate, and measure a variety of parameters simultaneously, and
return their results in digital form, relative to traditional mechanical methods
of measuring. This makes mass customization of products such as clothing and
contact lenses much faster and less expensive than traditional methods.</p>
<p>Mechanics Substitution may thus be seen to have much to offer in the context
of Mass Customization.</p>
<b><font color="#008000">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Thermal Expansion - </b>was interpreted in Reference 3 primarily as
increasing the ‘excitation’ (heat) of people in an organisation. In this
sense, there is a degree of overlap with the ‘Boosted Interactions’
Inventive Principle - which was shown in Pine’s book to be an important factor
in achieving Mass Customization through high responsiveness through the value
chain. The ‘differential expansion’ element of the Thermal Expansion
Principle, perhaps suggests that the desired high responsiveness might be
improved through due consideration of personality matching of the different
individuals in the different parts of the chain.</p>
<p>Either way, Thermal Expansion is unlikely to feature in any ‘top 5’
Inventive Principles relevant to the achievement of effective Mass
Customization.</p>
<font color="#008000">
<p>While in all probability possible to make connections between <b>every one</b>
of the Inventive Principles and the Mass Customization contradiction, based on
Pine’s book, and the work described here, the Principles most likely to be
beneficial in a Mass Customization context are felt to be, in approximate order
of descending importance:-</p>

<p>RELATION TO TRENDS OF EVOLUTION</p>
</b><font color="#008000">
<p></font>The Mass Customization phenomenon is consistent with several of the
TRIZ trends of evolution. In fact, it is possible to see direct connections with
just about all of the trends (Introduction of additives - user customizable
features, Rhythm Co-ordination - systems which adapt to the way in which
individual users utilise the product, Space Segmentation - evolution to
active/adaptive pores, etc). We will concentrate here on just a few:-</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>The trend towards increasing ideality</li>
  <li>Transition from macro to micro level, and</li>
  <li>Mono-Bi-Poly</li>
</ul>
<b>
<p>Ideality - </b>The trend towards increasing ideality (=benefits/(costs +
harm)) is universal. Successful Mass Customization requires the recognition that
different customers have different requirements; and that the benefits, costs
and penalties for one may thus be completely different for another. The most
significant change from traditional TRIZ practice is to shift the evaluation
from the point of view of the manufacturer to the point of view of the customer.</p>
<div align="left">
  <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="3" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
    <tr>
      <td><b>
        <p>Ideality Element</b></td>
      <td><b>
        <p>Traditional TRIZ: the manufacturer’s view</b></td>
      <td><b>
        <p>Mass Customization: the individual customer’s view</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p>Benefits</td>
      <td>
        <p>What the typical customer wants</td>
      <td>
        <p>What I want, at the time that I want it</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p>Cost</td>
      <td>
        <p>Materials, labor, design, distribution, packaging, sales, etc.</td>
      <td>
        <p>Costs to purchase, operate, maintain, and dispose of.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p>Harm</td>
      <td>
        <p>Undesirable side effects, legal liabilities, social impact</td>
      <td>
        <p>Undesirable features (Could be seen as benefits at a different time!)
        Time to learn to use it. Undesirable side effects, legal liabilities,
        social impact.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, Customer X’s vision of the ideal video recorder as one which can be
set to record a dozen different programmes, water the plants and feed the cat,
is Customer Y’s vision of an expensive product requiring a rocket-science
degree to operate. The designer and manufacturer have the challenge of creating
either one product where the complexity is hidden from Customer Y, and is
inexpensive enough that she will still buy the product, or creating two
products, where one is capable of all that Customer X wants and the other is
limited to only what Customer Y wants. This sets up a physical contradiction,
generally described in TRIZ as “I want A but I want ‘not A’ “ which is
solved at the general level by separation principles and at the operational
level by the 40 principles. (We will return to the solving of physical
contradictions in the business context in a future article.)</p>
<p>A successful Mass Customization shift is thus crucially dependent on the
ability to first tap into the different customer views on benefit, cost and
harm, and second to then translate that knowledge into products that can satisfy
all the demands.</p>
<font color="#008000"></font><b>
<p>Transition from macro to micro level - </b>while the increasing division of
physical entities into smaller and smaller components is highly analogous to the
idea of Mass Customization being focused on ever smaller customer groups, it is
also worth noting that the TRIZ trend progresses beyond the small scale object
through to powders, liquids, gas and ultimately fields. Whilst perhaps not
immediately obvious in the context of ‘customers’ rather than ‘things’,
the trend does continue to be applicable (and highly relevant) if an analogy is
drawn between ‘fields’ and customer ‘perceptions’ and ‘moods’.</p>
<font face="CG Times">
<p></font>A good example here comes from a recently opened London hotel.
Recognising that not only do different occupants have different preferences as
regards, say, the colour of the room they are staying in, but also that the same
occupant might have different desires depending on the time of day (i.e.
different moods), they have configured lighting and décor systems which allow
customers to modify the apparent colour of the room at the flick of a switch.</p>
<font color="#008000"></font><b>
<p>Mono-Bi-Poly - </b>the combination of similar and dis-similar objects into
‘combined polysystems’ is again highly consistent with the idea of mass
customized goods: Lots of different elements combined into a system means
increased likelihood that at least one will suit the particular requirements of
a given individual customer.</p>
<p>The problem here is the common ‘how poly is poly’ issue, or, how far
along the poly evolution path is it possible to go before the increased
functionality benefits begin to be out-weighed by the increased costs and harms?
Although there is no simple answer to this question, it appears clear - when
thinking about mass customization through product modularization - that, at the
very least, ‘combined polysystems’ need to incorporate the potential for
additional components/functions to be added - e.g. cameras, modular hi-fi
systems, dealer/user fit car accessories, etc.</p>
<p><b>Another Perspective</p>
</b>
<p>Following on from this activity, we set out to look at whether Joe Pine’s
work had anything to add to the TRIZ trends of evolution. The initial answer -
as shown in Figure 2 derived from Reference 6 - is that, yes it does.
Integration of the economic evolution from Commodity to Product to Service to
Experience based economic regimes with the technical trends of evolution then
appears to offer considerable business performance benefit potential. That will
be the subject of a future article.</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
<p></b>This article set out to answer three main questions:-</p>
<b></b>
</p><ol>
  <li>Is the Contradiction Matrix able to predict or reproduce the
    contradiction-eliminating solutions identified by Pine in his book?<br>
    (Answer: in part.)</li>
  <li>Do Pine’s solutions have anything to offer the TRIZ problem solving
    methods?<br>
    (Answer: The Mass Customization contradiction fits the current format of the
    Contradiction Matrix; the Inventive Principle solutions identified in Pine’s
    book fit within the scope of the current Inventive Principles; they offer
    significant potential for populating a future ‘Business Contradiction
    Matrix’)</li>
  <li>Does TRIZ have anything to offer organizations and researchers involved in
    Mass Customization projects above and beyond the solution strategies found
    in Pine’s book?<br>
    (Answer: Yes in terms of both use of the Inventive Principles and the trends
    of evolution.)</li>
</ol>
<p>A study of business evolution trends has shown that Mass Customization is
highly consistent with and complementary to established TRIZ trends of
technology evolution.</p>
<p>Mass Customization looks set to become a dominant business trend across many
industry sectors. TRIZ may be expected to play a significant role in helping
organizations to effectively and creatively enter or expand the Mass Customized
marketplace.</p>
