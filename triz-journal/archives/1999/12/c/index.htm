<p align="JUSTIFY">Introduction</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Modern companies compete in a
global marketplace. Advances in information technology have made marketing
products and communicating with customers a simple task. In fact, the customer
now has a great impact on decisions regarding improvements to existing products
and the design of new products. Often, engineering design goals focus on meeting
the needs and requirements of intended customers. Companies that wish to excel
in the global market must be prepared to generate quickly products that meet the
customer’s current needs and desires. They must also produce highly innovative
products to discourage competition. Thus, engineers are now faced with the need
to solve engineering design problems rapidly, cost effectively, and with a high
level of innovation. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of
TRIZ methods for rapidly creating innovative solutions at the concept generation
and prototyping phases of the engineering design process. These methods are
applied to a critical problem in the apparel manufacturing industry.
Specifically, a sensor system will be designed to monitor the quality of a
joining operation in the assembly of denim jeans.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In denim jean construction, the
felled seam comprises more seam length than any other seam type. The U.S.
government developed <i>Federal Standard 751a (FS751a),</i> which classifies
seams and stitches used in apparel garments. Lapped seam type C-2 (denoted <b>LSc-2)</b>
is generally the seam type used in jeans construction. This is the strongest of
the lapped seams since two rows of stitching are used to secure it. In this seam
“lapped bottom and top plies fold toward each other and interlock, displaying
no raw edges on either the outside or inside of the garment”[1]. Two rows of
type 401 chain stitch bind the seam. Figure 1a is a cross-sectional end view
schematic of an <b>LSc </b>seam.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Seam quality problems occur when
one or both of the two lapped fabric ends that are used to form the seam fail to
be formed or “stuffed” completely, such as in Figure 1b. Although a raw
fabric edge may not be visible, an “understuffed” seam exhibits less
strength than a properly formed seam. When the completed garments undergo the
post-finishing (washing) process, improperly stuffed seams tend to “blowout”
resulting in a total rejection of the garment. During the post-finishing process
it is likely to “blowout” as illustrated in Figure 1c.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">In jeans, the “seatseam” has
a high instance of failure. This seam runs from the crotch to the top of the
back of the jeans. This seam was selected as the first application for the new
monitoring system.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">Clapp [2] developed a method for
identifying defective seams by measuring the compressed thickness in the center
of the seam. Figure 1a shows a correct seam with four layers of fabric in the
center of the seam. Figure 1b shows a defective seam that has only three layers
of fabric in the center of the seam.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">TRIZ concepts, “Ideality”
and the “utilization of resources” were used to analyze and improve the
design of the initial monitoring system. “Ideality” is defined as the sum of
the useful functions divided by the sum of the harmful functions plus the sum of
the costs. “Ideality” approaches infinity as the design approaches the Ideal
Final Result (IFR). The ideal system meets all of the desired useful functions
with no harmful effects and at no cost. The primary function of the monitoring
system is to measure compressed seam thickness. The &quot;Ideal&quot; system
measures seam thickness and identifies all defects in the seam using no parts
and at no cost.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The initial prototype was
comprised of 14 parts. The function of each part was documented. The
&quot;Ideality&quot; method was used to systemically eliminate each part from
the system by eliminating or combining functions. This design exercise resulted
in the elimination of 6 parts from the original system. The &quot;Ideality&quot;
of the system was increased. The modified design reduced cost and improved
reliability of the system. Figure 4 shows the modified design.</font></p>

time, functional, and informational resources[6]. Table 2 shows a partial list
of resources available to the designer.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The sensor system was optimized
using the informational resource produced by the LVDT displacement signal shown
in Figure 4. The voltage trace of the LVDT contained much more information than
just the presence of a defect in the seam. Careful analysis of the trace clearly
showed when the leading edge of the fabric was approaching the sensor. This
triggered the encoder to start counting and record the distance traveled. A
second, large dip in the signal identified the presence of a riser seam and
prevented the system from classifying this as a defect. At the end of the
fabric, a sudden rise indicated the presence of the end of the fabric. The
information contained in the voltage trace was used to eliminate external
sensors and make the sensing system independent of seam length and speed.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">CONCLUSIONS</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">The use of TRIZ concepts,
&quot;Ideality&quot; and &quot;utilization of resources,&quot; resulted in an
improved sensor system. The concepts directed the designer's thinking to
systematically eliminate components of the design through the use of resources
available to the designer. Design objectives were achieved using 40% fewer
components.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">A production prototype was
constructed and tested. A rating system of 1-5 (5 - meets goal) was used to
evaluate the system against the original design goals. Table 1 shows the very
favorable ratings of the performance of the production prototype. A commercial
version of this system is now being used in manufacturing to eliminate the
internal defects that cannot be seen visually.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">This research proves that TRIZ
methods are valuable tools for rapidly designing robust systems.</font></p>
