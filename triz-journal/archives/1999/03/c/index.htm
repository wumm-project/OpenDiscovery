<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THE EVOLUTION OF PRODUCTS</b> All products are &quot;technical
systems,&quot; evolving over time. What evolves is the performance of technical systems,
as may be discerned from the following seven examples representing different product
areas:</p>

</p><ol>
  </p><ol>
    <b>
    <li>Transdermal Patches </b>If the technical system is a transdermal patch for delivering
      therapeutic agents through the skin, and into the blood stream, &quot;evolution&quot;
      refers to the system&#146;s increased capability for delivering drugs of ever-increasing
      molecular size (e.g., insulin and large protein molecules).</li>
    <b>
    <li>Shaving System </b>If the technical system is a disposable shaving system for
      &quot;cutting&quot; whiskers or hairs growing out of the skin, &quot;evolution&quot;
      refers to the system&#146;s increased capability to deliver closer shaves without cutting
      or injuring the skin, with manufacturing costs being only a fraction of the manufacturing
      cost of existing razors.</li>
    <b>
    <li>Inhalers </b>If the technical system is an inhaler for delivering a therapeutic agent to
      the lungs, &quot;evolution&quot; refers to the system&#146;s increased capability for
      delivering larger fractions of the quantity dispensed to the lungs, while not causing
      other problems on the way to the lungs.</li>
    <b>
    <li>Defibrillators </b>If the technical system is a defibrillator, &quot;evolution&quot;
      refers to the system&#146;s increased probability of reviving heart attack victims without
      also causing harmful effects (body burns, tissue damage, etc.) to the patient. Related
      goals are to achieve miniaturization and significant cost reduction.</li>
    <b>
    <li>Pacemakers </b>If the technical system is a pacemaker-like device - e.g., for treating
      epilepsy - &quot;evolution&quot; refers to the system&#146;s increased ability to deliver
      intermittent signals to the brain to control seizures - or even to allow patients to
      activate signals if they sense an oncoming seizure - without causing adverse effects of
      any kind, and at a reduced (pacemaker) unit manufacturing cost.</li>
    <b>
    <li>Non-invasive Instruments </b>If the technical system is a non-invasive instrument for
      measuring, e.g., elasticity of large and small arteries (to assist physicians in assessing
      patients' risk for cardiovascular disease), &quot;evolution&quot; refers to the
      system&#146;s increased accuracy, and to its increased ability to penetrate bodily tissues
      to the targeted areas of interest.</li>
    <b>
    <li>Cosmetics </b>If the technical system involves the timed delivery of cosmetics over a
      selected portion of the face, neck, etc., &quot;evolution&quot; refers to the
      system&#146;s increased ability to dispense cosmetic ingredients of ever-increasing
      molecular size - according to predetermined time-release profiles - to and into the skin.</li>
  </ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">S-CURVES DEPICT MARKET EXPANSION FOR PRODUCT FAMILIES</b> All product
families - including medical devices, drug delivery systems, shaving systems, and cosmetic
products - follow certain patterns as they evolve. The first point on an
&quot;evolutionary time-scale curve&quot; for a product is <i><b>discovery</b></i> -
marking the &quot;invention&quot; of an entirely new - or significantly improved - product
family.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For various reasons (lack of adequate investment capital, formidable
technical challenges, apparent market disinterest, etc.), it normally takes years or even
decades before the chief problems associated with a new product family are resolved. Only
then is the product ready for the marketplace. The performance progress of a typical
product family can be depicted by S-curves<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such curves have been collected for many industries and are available
in the book<sup>(2)</sup>, <i><b>Predictions : Society's Telltale Signature Reveals the
Past and Forecasts the Future</b></i>, by Theodore Modis (further remarks on Modis&#146;
book are presented as an Appendix to this paper). The uniqueness of these product family
curves is that they all follow the &quot;S &quot; shape - in spite of the fact that
certain industries are affected by the war-torn years, by politics, by natural disasters,
or by other major events.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oral delivery is the primary form of drug delivery used today. It
represents a multi-billion dollar industry. The performance of the industry as a whole can
be measured by the total number of units (tablets, etc.) produced. This performance is
illustrated below on a cost-independent S-curve.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image137.gif" border="1" WIDTH="630" HEIGHT="385"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oral-medication drugs represent a rather mature family. As indicated by
this generalized curve, at one point the industry went through a period of time during
which little progress occurred, then reached a point where production began to rise
rapidly, and finally approached a limiting level of production - which is the current
state of the oral drug industry, as measured by this performance index.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A linearized version of an S-Curve plot shows that oral drugs (i.e.,
powders, tinctures and tablets) initially went through an &quot;infancy&quot; stage
(discussed above), where little apparent progress occurred (behind the scenes, there was a
sporadic, if ill-funded, effort to resolve the problems associated with this mode of drug
delivery). After these problems were resolved, production rose rapidly.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image138.gif" border="1" WIDTH="630" HEIGHT="387"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the &quot;rapid growth&quot; stage, competitors began producing
similar products. Competition guaranteed a high rate of improvement. The product family
(tablets) flourished in the marketplace. Significant technical strides were made,
including &quot;time released capsules,&quot; &quot;low-friction coatings,&quot; and
&quot;sublingual and liquefied drugs.&quot; Manufacturing production methods were
improved. Ultimately a &quot;saturation&quot; limit was reached, which fixed the market
possibilities for oral medicines.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this stage of the S-curve, drug manufacturers wanted to assure that
their &quot;cash cow&quot; products would continue. This goal drove all further technical
efforts associated with oral medications. The product had reached a certain
&quot;maturity&quot; level. All truly innovative efforts are downplayed at this stage, or
even halted. This is essentially the point that the oral-medications industry is at today.
</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some small, new company (or perhaps the research department of an
existing large company already in the business) may - at this stage - achieve a
breakthrough that makes it possible to deliver literally all (formerly orally delivered)
drugs in a non-invasive way that is &quot;other than oral,&quot; and which is cost
effective. Such a breakthrough will make orally delivered drugs (pills, etc.) relatively
obsolete. This breakthrough initiates a new S-Curve. A brand new industry is born -
perhaps with new corporate players. If existing pharmaceutical companies are not a part of
the new breakthrough, they may not be among the new players.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">S-CURVES DESCRIBE THE EVOLUTION OF PRODUCT PERFORMANCE</b> As discussed
above, the performance of an entire industry is measured in terms of the number of product
units produced by that industry. However, the functional performance of an individual
product is measured in units that are more &quot;technical.&quot; Some of these
&quot;technical performance indices&quot; are mentioned for products 1 through 7 above.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, transdermal drug delivery systems are technically limited
to the range of molecular sizes of drugs capable of permeating the skin. The skin will not
admit most larger-molecules. Therefore transdermal delivery systems can be
&quot;rated&quot; in terms of the &quot;limiting&quot; (i.e., maximum) molecular weight
that can be successfully delivered. This rating is the performance index of the system,
which, when plotted historically against time, should yield an S-curve shape. As
transdermal systems evolve, it is expected that they will become capable of delivering
drug molecules of ever-increasing size and complexity. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The S-curve for transdermal drug delivery systems is shown below. The
&quot;X&quot; point on the curve indicates that today&#146;s transdermal systems are in
the &quot;infancy&quot; stage of their possible evolution. Designers, scientists and
researchers have been working to discover how to deliver an entire range of
larger-molecule therapeutic agents through the skin, in a way that does not increase costs
to producers of transdermal patches and similar devices.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BioFutures has already discovered how to do this, using the Triads<sup>(3)</sup>
and TRIZ approaches, as well as their own, proprietary, technology-forecasting algorithms,
developed for the pharmaceutical and allied industries.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image139.gif" border="1" WIDTH="596" HEIGHT="363"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This same technology forecasting capability has also been applied to
the cosmetics industry. The cosmetics industry enjoys an advantage that pharmaceutical
companies making prescription drugs does not have. Over-the-counter cosmetic substances
are not subject to the same, rigorous, time-consuming requirements imposed by outside
agencies on prescription drug companies.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BioFutures is actively engaged in applying lessons learned in
transdermal delivery technology to cosmetics.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">PREDICTING NEXT-GENERATION PRODUCT BREAKTHROUGHS</b></font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DISPOSABLE RAZORS</b> Disposable razor blades for shaving represent a
huge world-wide marketplace. A real driver in this industry is cost-reduction. Some
producers of disposable razors believe that significant cost reduction is not possible
without compromising technical performance features of their products. Others believe that
further breakthrough-level performance increases are not possible. BioFutures&#146;
next-generation, product-forecasting algorithm predicts that both are possible:
significant cost reductions and next-generation, disposable shaving systems.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BioFutures applied its proprietary technology-forecasting algorithms to
disposable razor blade design and manufacturing. Results indicate that unit manufacturing
costs can be significantly reduced, while also conceiving next-generation design
breakthroughs in performance.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BioFutures&#146; algorithms make use of the &quot;Triads&quot; and TRIZ
creativity approaches. These approaches assist designers in eliminating or reducing
habitual barriers to creating breakthrough designs. Altshuller<sup>(4)</sup> calls these
barriers &quot;psychological inertia.&quot; One form of psychological inertia is the
belief that &quot;the current design has already been optimized, and is close to the ideal
design.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For a typical disposable razor sold on the shelves, this belief is not
true. BioFutures&#146; design and cost algorithms demonstrate that the efficiency of the
main performance function for this system - &quot;cutting&quot; - is still quite low, and
can be significantly improved. It has also been demonstrated that unit manufacturing costs
of most disposable razors currently on store shelves can be reduced by a minimum of ten to
forty percent.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BioFutures has already conducted a cost and performance analysis of
disposable razors, and is now planning to ally with a major disposable razor producer in
order to field next-generation disposable razor designs, while simultaneously achieving
significant cost reductions. The analysis was conducted by using invention software
produced by the Invention Machine Corporation. This software is called TechOptimizer 3.0,
and it contains several very useful problem-solving and invention modules. Three modules
employed by BioFutures on disposable shavers are called (1) &quot;Effects,&quot; (2)
&quot;Product Functional Analysis,&quot; and (2) Feature Transfer.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">CASE STUDY: USING TRIADS TO PREDICT</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">AND CONCEIVE NEXT-GENERATION PRODUCTS</font></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For proprietary reasons it is not possible to disclose further
information about next-generation razor blade systems. However, the following case study
example on defibrillation systems serves as an example of how BioFutures uses the Triad
Approach for the prediction of next-generation designs<sup>(5)</sup>.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEXT-GENERATION DEFIBRILLATORS</b> The main function of a defibrillator
is to re-start the heartbeat of a heart-attack victim through the application of an
electrical shock. The passive object is the heart. The active object is the defibrillator
system. The enabling object is an emergency team member. The essential functions are:</p>

</p><ol>
  <li><font SIZE="1"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>DEFIBRILLATOR</u> <u>ELECTRICALLY SHOCKS</u> <u>HEART</u>.</p>
    </font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="1"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>EMERGENCY TEAM MEMBER</u> <u>ACTIVATES</u> <u>DEFIBRILLATOR</u>.</p>
    </font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="1"><u>EMERGENCY TEAM MEMBER</u> <u>OBSERVES &amp; ASSESSES STATE OF</u> <u>HEART</u>.</font></li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These three objects (heart; defibrillator; and emergency team member),
and their interactions, form the triad shown below.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image140.gif" border="0" WIDTH="420" HEIGHT="179"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If one of the objects of the triad are pruned (i.e., eliminated), then
that object&#146;s functions need to be considered.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, suppose we decide to &quot;prune&quot; the emergency team
member.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image141.gif" border="0" WIDTH="420" HEIGHT="189"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eight key questions emerge from this decision:</p>

</p><ol>
  <li>Is the defibrillator really necessary from the point of view that it needs to be
    activated by an emergency team member? Under what circumstances would the defibrillator
    not be necessary?</li>
  <li>Is it necessary for the defibrillator to be activated? Under what circumstances might it
    not have to be activated?</li>
  <li>Can the patient himself, or his own heart, activate the defibrillator? What could this
    mean in terms of a new design?</li>
  <li>Can the defibrillator activate itself? What could this mean in terms of a new design?</li>
  <li>Is the heart really necessary - from the point of view that it&#146;s state (or the
    patient&#146;s state) needs to be observed and assessed? Under what circumstances would
    the heart or patient not be necessary from this point of view?</li>
  <li>Is it necessary for the state of the heart or patient to be observed and assessed by the
    emergency team member? Under what circumstances would that not be necessary?</li>
  <li>Can the patient, or the patient&#146;s heart, observe and assess its/his own state? What
    could this mean in terms of a new design?</li>
  <li>Can the defibrillator observe and assess the state of the heart or patient? What could
    this mean in terms of a new design?</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The answers to these eight questions are not easy. Some of them may
appear to be ridiculous. Others may in fact actually <i><b>be</b></i> ridiculous.
Nevertheless, as a collection, they lead to next-generation revival systems - in a manner
that also leads to the ideal final system.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eight more questions arise if we decide to prune the defibrillator:</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image142.gif" border="0" WIDTH="420" HEIGHT="189"></p>

</p><ol>
  <li>Is the heart really necessary from a &quot;providing an electrical shock to the
    heart&quot; point of view? Under what circumstances would the heart not be necessary from
    this point of view?</li>
  <li>Is it necessary for the heart to be electrically shocked? Under what circumstances might
    it not have to be electrically shocked?</li>
  <li>Can the emergency team member, in the absence of a defibrillator, somehow electrically
    shock the heart? What could this mean in terms of a new design?</li>
  <li>Can the heart (or the patient), in the absence of a defibrillator, electrically shock
    itself (himself)? What could this mean in terms of a new design?</li>
  <li>Is the emergency team member really necessary if the defibrillator is pruned? Under what
    circumstances would the emergency team member not be necessary?</li>
  <li>Is it necessary for the defibrillator to be activated at all? Under what circumstances
    would that not be necessary?</li>
  <li>Can the emergency team member, in the absence of a defibrillator, somehow activate an
    electrical shock to the heart of the patient? What could this mean in terms of a new
    design?</li>
  <li>Can the heart itself (or the patient), in the absence of a defibrillator, somehow
    activate an electrical shock to itself/himself? What could this mean in terms of a new
    design?</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="4"><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">SOLUTIONS</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we consider the 16 questions listed above as a whole, certain
creative paths - and features of creative solutions - come to mind. The following is a
list of potential solution features (along with the question number above that stimulated
each solution feature):</p>

<ol TYPE="A">
  <li>(1) The defibrillator can be activated remotely by a third party, of from an auxiliary
    device. Design this feature in.</li>
  <li>(2) When there is a patient heartbeat, the defibrillator will not deliver an electrical
    shock, but it will deliver an electrical shock when it is attached to the patient, and
    when there is no heartbeat. This feature should be designed into the defibrillator.</li>
  <li>(3) The patient sends out a signal to the defibrillator to activate an electrical shock.
    This signal decision may come directly from the patient&#146;s heart, or from a device
    that is monitoring the patient&#146;s heart. The defibrillator is designed to receive such
    a signal, and to automatically deliver an electrical shock when signaled.</li>
  <li>(4) Design a defibrillator that is self-activating. When an electrical shock is required
    for the patient, the defibrillator itself activates that requirement. No human being
    (i.e., emergency team member) is necessary to activate it.</li>
  <li>(5) Some other part of the patient (i.e., other than the heart) is assessed/observed to
    determine the patient&#146;s state of health. This observation/assessment does not require
    an emergency team member.</li>
  <li>(6) The state of the heart (patient) can be observed/assessed by other means than by the
    emergency team member (i.e., by a sensor/monitor worn by the patient, which is programmed
    to determine the need for an electrical shock).</li>
  <li>(7) The heart/patient has its own &quot;micro&quot; version of an emergency team member,
    attached to it. This device is electro-sensory, recording one or more of the
    patient&#146;s vital signs or signals, and transposing them into a signal, which is
    transmitted to a miniaturized defibrillator also attached to the patient.</li>
  <li>(8) The defibrillator is equipped with a receiver that senses the patient&#146;s state,
    and determines appropriate action.</li>
  <li>(9) Start the heartbeat in the heart by doing something to another organ, to the nervous
    system, etc., via another medical device system.</li>
  <li>(10) Find/design another way to re-instate a heartbeat, other than through an electrical
    shock, or other than from a defibrillator.</li>
  <li>(11) Use the emergency team member&#146;s vehicle, electrically equipped to deliver the
    required power-time profile, to the patient.</li>
  <li>(12) The patient wears an electrical shock device that also senses the patient&#146;s
    state and decides if the patient needs the shock.</li>
  <li>(13) The defibrillator is self-activating (see D above).</li>
  <li>(14) The defibrillator is always activated, and therefore never needs to re-activated,
    as long as the patient has no heartbeat.</li>
  <li>(15) The emergency team member has an alternative way of reviving the patient.</li>
  <li>(16) See G above.</li>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURE: DISCUSSION AND RESULTS</b> It&#146;s easy to
miss important results that can be gathered by the steps that we just went through - even
though we have not yet completed the entire procedure. I want to stop at this point,
therefore, and review - from a generic point of view - what we just did, and also review
some of the conclusions and results that have come from what we just did. We&#146;ll start
with a generic description of the procedure used, referring to the defibrillation system
case study for clarification.</p>

</p><ol>
  <li>We began with the selection of an actual system for accomplishing some performance
    function. The specific system chosen was the defibrillation system. It&#146;s used to
    re-start the heart of a heart attack victim.</li>
  <li>The next step we took was to construct the triad of three objects that describes the
    function - that triad actually <b>is</b> the function, because without any one of the
    three objects in a triad, there would be no function. Therefore the objects in the triad
    are essential parts of the selected &quot;system&quot; called &quot;re-starting the heart
    of a heart-attack victim.&quot;</li>
</ol>

<ol TYPE="A">
  <ol TYPE="A">
    <li>There are always three objects in a triad. One of the objects is the passive object, and
      it is the object to which something is being &quot;done&quot; or &quot;accomplished.&quot;</li>
    <li>A second object is the active object, and it is the object that does something to the
      passive object - it&#146;s also the object that accomplishes what is being accomplished.</li>
    <li>The third object is not always easy to identify. That is the enabling object, and it is
      the object, without which, the active and passive objects would not interact in the
      desired way.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<ol START="3">
  <li>Once we have the triad in place, we examine the interactions in the triad to determine
    the functional relationships between the objects. Generally speaking, the functional
    relationship between the active and passive object is easy to understand. The
    relationships between the enabling object and the other two objects, however, are not
    always easy to understand.</li>
</ol>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">COMMENTARY</b> If we have gone this far in analyzing a problem
situation, then we are already pretty far along. We usually have three interactions to
examine. Each of these can be improved in various ways, and there are several tools of the
TRIZ approach that can assist us in improving these interactions. For example, we could
apply the laws of development of technical systems to the objects and actions in this
triad. Or, we could look at the interactions between any two objects and further develop
the problem in terms of a conflict, and use Altshuller&#146;s conflict matrix to locate
inventive principles that we can apply to the objects and actions of the interaction. Or,
we can follow the entire ARIZ procedure for a particular interaction in the triad -
usually ARIZ is to an interaction between the active and passive object.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of these &quot;ways leading to creative solutions&quot; are
admissible, but there is a way that leads us to the ideal final result not only
&quot;ultimately&quot; - but quite rapidly. This way involves &quot;pruning&quot; (i.e.,
removing) a part, or the whole, of one of the objects in the triad.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The step called &quot;pruning&quot; rapidly leads us towards the ideal
final result. The system also becomes simplified (not made more complex). By pruning a
system, one or more measures of &quot;ideality&quot; of the system are increased.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If one of the objects in a triad is pruned, then we have a problem: we
no longer have a function, because there is no triad. The minimum requirement for any
function to exist is that there have to be three objects (active, passive and enabling).
So after pruning occurs, we truly have a conflict:</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The object must be pruned, in order to simplify the system and
  move towards ideality, and the object must not be pruned, so that we retain the function.</b></i></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We&#146;ll continue the &quot;Triads plus Pruning&quot; procedure with
step 4 below.</p>

<ol START="4">
  <li>Choose one of the objects for pruning, using your intuition and knowledge of the
    constraints on the system. It may be good not to choose the passive object first, although
    it is probably a good idea to explore the ramifications of pruning each of the three
    objects in the system - one at a time. For the defibrillator system, we decided to prune
    the operator - the emergency team member who applies the defibrillator to the heart attack
    victim.</li>
  <li>Examining the remaining parts of the triad, ask the following question: &quot;When the
    object chosen is pruned, what interactions are affected?&quot; Identify the interaction -
    or interactions - that are affected. For example, if we prune the emergency team member,
    two interactions are affected:</li>
</ol>

<ol TYPE="A">
  <ol TYPE="A">
    <li>&quot;Emergency team member activates defibrillator,&quot; and</li>
    <li>&quot;Emergency team member observes and assesses the state of the patient&#146;s
      heart.&quot;</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<ol START="6">
  <li>Identify the interactions in which the object being pruned is the &quot;active&quot;
    object. For each interaction where the object being pruned is the active object, consider
    the following questions:</li>
</ol>

<ol TYPE="A">
  <ol TYPE="A">
    <li>Is it possible that some other object in the system (including any parts remaining from
      the object being pruned) can assume the functions of the object being pruned? What design
      configurations will make this happen? Identify those design configurations.</li>
    <li>Are there design configurations where - for the sake of the interaction under
      consideration - the passive object (or the part or parts of it that are involved in the
      interaction) is not required? Identify those design configurations (keeping in mind that
      the active object - or certain parts of it - has been pruned).</li>
    <li>Are there design configurations where the interaction or action itself is not required?
      Identify those design configurations, keeping in mind that the active object of that
      interaction has been pruned.</li>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>COMMENTARY</b> This is about as far as we have gone in the process
of &quot;Forming a triad and then pruning,&quot; with the defibrillator example. If you
recall, we generated sixteen generic solutions - some of which appeared to be very similar
to each other. Then we considered each generic solution, and through the application of
&quot;abstract thinking,&quot; generated specific solutions (A through P). Let&#146;s
attempt to summarize the features of specific designs that are generated by our procedure:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="4"><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">FEATURES OF NEXT-GENERATION &quot;REVIVING&quot; SYSTEMS</b></font></p>

</p><ol>
  <b>
  <li>ELIMINATION OF HUMAN INVOLVEMENT</b> The system under consideration involves human
    beings other than the heart attack victim, for two purposes: assessing the victim&#146;s
    state of health, and activating the defibrillator. Inventive prompts from the &quot;triads
    plus pruning&quot; process suggest that designs of the future will eliminate these aspects
    of human involvement. Instead, the &quot;defibrillator itself&quot; will assess the victim
    and decide to deliver what is necessary to the victim. This requires sensory, feedback,
    decision-making, and activating features on new &quot;defibrillator&quot; designs. Implied
    with these features are &quot;connections&quot; between the new &quot;defibrillator&quot;
    and the victim.</li>
  <b>
  <li>REMOTE, THIRD-PARTY, OR AUTOMATIC INVOLVEMENT</b> Intelligent sensing, decision-making
    and activation can be provided remotely at any time, around the clock. This implies an
    intimate connection between the next-generation &quot;defibrillator&quot; and the victim,
    as well as sensory, feedback, decision-making, and activation features &quot;at a
    distance&quot; from the victim.</li>
  <b>
  <li>INTELLIGENT SENSING AND DECISION-MAKING</b> Next-generation designs will have some sort
    of programmed intelligence concerning the information communicated from intelligent
    sensors already in touch with (i.e., monitoring) the victim&#146;s body (perhaps before
    the oncoming of a heart attack). These intelligent sensors may be monitoring the
    victim&#146;s heart directly, or they may be indirectly monitoring other patient
    characteristics (i.e., other vital signs of the patient) - which may be able to be
    monitored more remotely (and with less invasiveness or patient inconvenience).</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sensing devices can be described as being &quot;electro-sensory,&quot;
  recording one or more of the patient&#146;s vital signs or signals, and transposing them
  into a signal, which is transmitted to a miniaturized defibrillator also attached to the
  patient (see Feature 4, next).</p>
</blockquote>

<ol START="4">
  <b>
  <li>PATIENT &quot;WEARS&quot; CERTAIN SYSTEM PARTS</b> Sensors with feedback capability, and
    means of delivering shocks or signals, can be worn in advance by the patient (or,
    implanted in advance in the patient). The implication is there that advance
    &quot;shocks&quot; could be far less mild than the conventional defibrillator shock -
    e.g., more like a pacemaker. In the case of a conventional defibrillator, future design
    requirements call for far lighter and far more intelligent defibrillators - capable of
    being worn by patients who might require defibrillation sometime in the future (as
    determined by their physicians).</li>
  <b>
  <li>REVIVING VICTIMS THROUGH OTHER-THAN-ELECTRIC-SHOCK MEANS</b> Next-Generation designs
    will feature means to revive heart attack victims other than through the conventional
    method of delivering an electrical shock with a fixed, power-time profile. A next-step
    design configuration will probably include a pulsed, power-time profile - delivering the
    same profile shape, but significantly less energy. Then new revivification techniques will
    follow. These may involve organs and bodily systems other than just the heart - or,
    instead of the heart.</li>
  <b>
  <li>MODIFICATIONS TO THE &quot;ENGINE&quot; OF CURRENT DEFIBRILLATORS</b> In the near term,
    we can expect to see some system merging, involving the use of other available systems to
    be the source of power for defibrillators - thereby allowing defibrillators to be lighter
    and more effective. For example, motorized vehicle power units can be equipped to provide
    defibrillator power to victims reached by mobile emergency teams.</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The above characteristics of next-generation defibrillator devices are
only a few, among many, that can be realized by using all the tools of TRIZ. They are,
however, major characteristics and features that move current defibrillators closer to
&quot;the ideal design.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="4"><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">TRIADS AND PRUNING ON A MICRO-LEVEL</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also possible to apply the &quot;Triads and Pruning&quot;
procedure to defibrillators (or to any product or process) on a micro-level. For example,
one of the problems associated with defibrillators is &quot;chest area burns&quot;
associated with the energy absorbed during shock delivery. Medical research dictates that
the shape of the electrical Power-Time profile delivered has to have a certain shape for
maximizing the probability of reviving the patient. The area under the power-time curve is
energy, and unfortunately, this excessive energy causes the harmful side effects mentioned
above.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The passive object of this triad is the heart. The active object is an
electrical shock having a certain power-time profile shape. The enabling object is an
electrical power supply system. Let us divide the electrical power-time profile into two
&quot;parts&quot; - a useful one and a harmful one. If the harmful part of the electrical
shock profile (the one that contributes to patient burns) is pruned, we are left with the
useful part (the essential part of the electrical shock profile that revives the patient).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is where the tools of TRIZ can be used. Let&#146;s express the
physical contradiction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The profile shape of the electrical shock has to be unchanged, to
    maximize the probability of reviving the victim, and the profile shape of the electrical
    shock has to be changed, to reduce the area (energy) under the power-time curve.</b></i></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This conflict can be resolved in several ways, including the following:</p>

</p><ol>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Deliver a rapid burst of many, shorter-in-time, power-time profiles - each having the
      required shape.</li>
    <li>Deliver the same profile shape, except that the power is &quot;pulsed.&quot; That is,
      the overall shape looks the same in time and in power, but on a more microscopic scale,
      the shock is delivered in short pulses with no electrical delivery in between the pulses.
      In this way the power-time profile shape is the same, but the total energy delivered is
      only a fraction of what was previously delivered to the victim. Drawings of the problem
      and the solution (i.e., before and after Triads was applied) are shown below.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image143.gif" border="0" WIDTH="507" HEIGHT="278"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let&#146;s discuss what was accomplished. We first formed a Triad.
Then, the original power-time profile was pruned, and replaced by a <i><b>pulsed</b></i>
power-time profile having the same shape. A modification of existing system resources was
used to solve the problem.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">CURRENT PROJECT ACTIVITY</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BioFutures&#146; application of &quot;Triads + Pruning&quot; to
disposable razor blades has resulted in a project to build disposable razor prototypes
that have both superior performance as well as significantly lower
unit-manufacturing-costs. This project is already in the testing stage and the results are
very promising. BioFutures plans to form a strategic alliance with a major disposable
razor producer to manufacture the new disposable razor systems in the near future.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that this brief introduction to Triads and Pruning has helped
you to understand more about the Triads approach. The Triads approach is particularly
useful for predicting - with high accuracy - next-generation design configurations for any
product family you choose. At BioFutures we welcome inquiries from medical-device, shaving
system and cosmetic companies seeking to conceive and produce next-generation products of
the future - now.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">APPENDIX. S-CURVE COMMENTARIES</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Predictions : Society's Telltale Signature Reveals<br>
the Past and Forecasts the Future, by Theodore Modis</p>
</i></b></font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Citing experts at the International Institute of Advanced Systems
Analysis as the source of the information he presents, Theodore Modis, a physicist
(formerly from the Digital Equipment Corporation), examines technical, economic, and
social trends. He describes growth curves that predict how competing animal species
survive in the face of competition for limited resources. Modis goes on to explain how
these same curves - and the equations upon which they are based - can be applied to
nonbiological phenomena - inventions, sources of energy, and human activities, ranging
from an artist&#146;s productivity to the spread of diseases.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Modis explores two types of curves that the above-mentioned systems and
their associated phenomena follow:</p>

</p><ol>
  </p><ol>
    <li>The well known bell-shaped, &quot;normal distribution&quot; curve.</li>
    <li>The curve of its integral: the S-curve.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The plots presented in Modis&#146; book address motor-vehicle deaths,
world-wide energy-source competition and substitution, the output of geniuses, economic
cycles, and innovation. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some readers might view what Modis has to offer with so much
skepticism, that they are likely to miss the key points of this book. Nature follows
certain laws. Human beings - and their output and results - are a part of nature. Humans
too, are subject to these same laws. Knowing the laws means being able to predict
phenomena associated with nature and human beings. The phenomena of specific interest to
this audience include inventing (product and process conception), problem-solving, product
and process improvement, technical forecasting and anticipatory failure analysis.
Modis&#146; laws and equations apply to these phenomena.</p>
