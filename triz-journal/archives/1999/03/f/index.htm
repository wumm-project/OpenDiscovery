<p>On January the 21st 1999 the first European TRIZ conference took place in Vienna. It
was organized by the Austrian Chamber of Commerce and supported by the Technical
University of Vienna. Dipl.-Ing. Krainz and Prof. Biberschick acted as chairmen and guided
the program. The orators were TRIZ experts from all over the world. To enhance
communication, all speakers were translated into English, German and Russian
simultaneously. The 120 auditors came from companies all over Europe, which proves the
fact that TRIZ is accepted as a very powerful tool for problem solving and enjoys a good
reputation in industry, too.</p>

<p>At the beginning Prof. A. I. Kuprjuchin (University of Technology Nowosibirsk) gave a
wide survey of the TRIZ philosophy and the methodology. He explained how TRIZ can change
everybody's way of thinking. After this generic contribution Mr. Royzen (TRIZ Consulting
Inc.) explained how TRIZ works. He illustrated how easily problems can be solved, if you
make an complete and precisely function analysis. For that reason he developed the
TOP-analysis. With several different examples he demonstrated the audience, how to solve
problems using standardized problem solving methods. Mr. Ing. E. Kratochvil is an expert
for patents and he demonstrated how important it can be to look into databases before
starting a new R&amp;D-project.</p>

<p>After lunch Prof. Lindemann (University of Technology Munich) illustrated how TRIZ can
be integrated and he presented an interesting analysis, which shows the feedback from
people who used TRIZ. After every single step, they made a review and documented positive
and negative experiences.</p>

<p>Dipl.-Ing. Veit Kohnhauser (University of Technology Vienna) showed the audience how
existing traditional methods like QFD, FMEA, Design of experiments can be combined with
TRIZ. Therefore he used a simple mouse trap and illustrated how to develop customer
orientated, innovative products, with a perfect product performance.</p>

<p>After these discourses representatives from two big TRIZ-Software companies (Invention
Machine and Ideation) presented their products and demonstrated how software can support
the problem solving process.</p>

<p>To show the audience how TRIZ is used in industry, the last two speakers talked about
projects in their companies. Dr. Herb gave us very interesting and practice relevant
information about TRIZ. He uses this methodology for the development of medical diagnostic
devices. Mr. Teufelsdorfer concluded this conference, with an example of the automotive
industry, which was made by Siemens together with Invention Machine.</p>

<p>The TRIZ conference in Vienna was a one day event and we received a lot of positive
feedback. It showed that TRIZ is becoming more and more popular in Europe and it was also
interesting to recognize, that many companies already use this method as a standard tool
in their product development process. Thanks to all our conference speakers and of course
thank you to all auditors for their interest. </p>
