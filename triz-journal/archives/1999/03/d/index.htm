<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, this article should not be regarded as scientific. The only idea
it discusses is how to view on TRIZ. I found this issue extremely important, because there
is a lot of misunderstanding of what TRIZ is, in particular, by those who encounter with
TRIZ for the first time. The questions I hear over and over again (even from those who
took training in TRIZ) are &#145;what is TRIZ? Is it a problem-solving method? Is it a
science? Is it a methodology? Is it a toolbox? Is it something to help us with breaking
our mental barriers and improve our creativity?&#146; And so on. So I decided to make a
brief overview of what TRIZ really is, to shed some light on these questions.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my professional opinion, modern TRIZ comprises four distinct
directions: </p>

</p><ol>
  <li>Theory of technology origins and evolution.</li>
  <li>Techniques for overcoming mental inertia.</li>
  <li>Techniques for analyzing, formulating and solving inventive problems.</li>
  <li>Pointers, which organize mapping between technical functions and specific design
    solutions, technologies, and knowledge of natural science.</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In TRIZ, these directions did not evolve independently. However this
could not be otherwise, as TRIZ originated from extensive studies of technical and patent
information and has been developing since as a methodology for improving engineering
creativity, and not as a science.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ was born as a problem-solving tool based on a systemic view of the
technological world. The primary idea behind TRIZ approach to solving problems is that
information about a specific problem must be first generalized, a solution concept has to
be generated, and then the concept should be specialized in terms of a feasible solution.
Generalization is a very powerful tool aimed at identifying new problems with pre-defined
solution patterns, which can be found in TRIZ. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Studies of patent collections by Altshuller indicated that only two per
cent of solutions were truly pioneering inventions; the rest presented the use of
previously known idea or a concept but in a novel way. Thus the conclusion was that an
idea of a solution to a new problem might be already known. But where this idea could be
found? TRIZ helps to avoid numerous trials and errors and solve problems by using
generalized patterns of previous solutions. Basic assumption behind TRIZ is that if two
problems from different technological areas result in identical models, they must have
similar solution patterns.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Later, it was found that common patterns exist not only between
individual solutions. Similar patterns were observed between evolution of different
technical systems and design products over the time. A conclusion was made that the
evolution of technology is regular, not random, and further studies were pursued in this
direction. Thus TRIZ acquired a solid scientific foundation and turned out to be more than
a stand-alone design methodology or a collection of problem solving techniques.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Theory of technology origins and evolution.</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As seen from the proposed schema, TRIZ can only be regarded as a
science at the level of the theory for technology origins and evolution. Major theoretical
findings and discoveries reside here. Among them are:</p>

</p><ul>
  <li>Statement that technology evolves through resolving contradictions.</li>
  <li>Definition of an invention as a result of eliminating a contradiction between
    potentially conflicting parameters.</li>
  <li>A new categorization of inventive solutions.</li>
  <li>The concept of ideality.</li>
  <li>Discovery of generic regularities and patterns of evolution of the technology.</li>
  <li>Formulation of the laws and trends of the technology evolution. </li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, TRIZ does not yet belong to a category of exact, formal science.
This would be hardly possible considering the great diversity of inexact knowledge
categories that TRIZ deals with. But the creation of a formal theory behind TRIZ is a
question of time, as I tend to believe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mental Inertia.</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Techniques for overcoming psychological inertia are used to free
inventor&#146;s mind from mental blockage and help to improve thinking at metaphoric
level. As known from psychology, verbal information is strongly related to visual
information, so it does not matter in what way an individual reasoning process is
organized, there might be a mental block inside human mind. Even simple operation of
avoiding specific terms sometimes helps to solve difficult problems.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ introduces the following methods for tackling mental inertia:</p>

</p><ul>
  <li>Multi-screen diagram of advanced thinking.</li>
  <li>Thinking in terms of Ideal Functions and Ideal Systems.</li>
  <li>Different techniques for eliminating psychological inertia and thinking out-of-the-box,
    for instance, Operator &quot;Size-Time-Costs&quot;.</li>
  <li>Modeling with miniature dwarfs.</li>
  <li>The strategy for forming creative personality, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As noted by Altshuller, a main distinction between talented (or
&#145;advanced&#146;) and traditional ways of thinking is that the former always sees the
problem in its interrelations with other problems as well as with the rest of a system
where the problem arose. Apart from that, another property of the advanced thinking is
that brain produces causal analysis of relationships within a system and its environment.
Although these abilities are usually regarded as a prerogative of those who possess
&#145;visionary&#146; way of reasoning, systems thinking can be trained and mastered, and
TRIZ techniques are of a great help with that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problem Solving.</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The TRIZ problem solving techniques deal with the process of
abstraction. We extract a core of a problem, then generalize it. We do not use every piece
of information about the product where the problem resides, we only focus on its part
which causes the problem. The way to generalize over a specific situation is to represent
a problem as a contradiction, or a substance-field model, or just as a required function.
Then we use a guideline or a generic solution pattern and transform the problem into a
solution concept. The next step is to find such an instance of the concept that produces a
specific feasible solution. If we do not succeed with specialization, we refine and
reformulate the problem. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ problem solving techniques are:</p>

</p><ul>
  <li>Inventive Principles for elimination of technical contradictions.</li>
  <li>Principles for elimination of physical contradictions.</li>
  <li>Inventive Standards.</li>
  <li>Algorithm for Inventive Problem Solving.</li>
  <li>Function and Cost Analysis, and trimming.</li>
  <li>Feature transfer, and other techniques.</li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is missing in TRIZ is the specialization part. The concepts
resulted from problem solving are usually very general and lack details that allow us to
made conclusions about feasibility of the concepts. Failure to specialize does not
necessarily mean that the concept generated is wrong &#150; probably we just do not
possess specific knowledge that solves the problem? The pointers to effects and
technologies often help to find the needed knowledge at this phase, since they include
more specific knowledge than TRIZ principles and solution patterns. However, it is not
always possible. Nevertheless, my experience shows that, if the subject matter expert
solves the problem with the use of TRIZ tools, the chances of coming up with a real
solution are rather high. Simply because TRIZ helps to look at problems differently. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there are two separate methods of how TRIZ deals with
problems. The first method proposes to model a problem in terms of a contradiction or a
substance-field model and then transform the problem to a solution using TRIZ patterns and
guidelines. According to the second method, we can transform the problem to a solution by
following the trends of the technology evolution. TRIZ does not produce a clear answer
when and what method to use, the general recommendation is that the second method should
be used when we want to predict how the design product will evolve in the future. On the
other hand, many specific patterns of evolution are incorporated into TRIZ problem solving
techniques. This situation might create confusion when a newcomer starts learning TRIZ and
has no clear picture of TRIZ as a system of knowledge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Function-Effect Mapping.</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The pointers (or indices) to effects bridge a gap between exact
sciences and technology. TRIZ offers the following pointers:</p>

</p><ul>
  <li>Pointers to physical, chemical, and geometrical phenomena and effects.</li>
  <li>Pointers to specific technologies which can have a broad range of applications. </li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The pointers are probably the most easy to use tools in TRIZ, but they
are not easy to create. Pointers offer purely functional approach: they establish mapping
between technical functions and effects that can deliver these functions. Effects are
natural effects and phenomena known in physics, chemistry, and geometry. In addition,
pointers relate the generic technical functions and specific technologies. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the pointers can be used directly to solve a problem, in most
cases a thorough analysis of the problem is still required, in particular, when we deal
with ill-defined problem formulation. Knowledge of what particular function is needed to
solve the problem is not always available at the very beginning of the problem solving
process.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Conclusions.</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The view on TRIZ proposed helps to systematize TRIZ knowledge and
brings more clarity into the issue of what TRIZ is and how to look at it. I also
highlighted some problems, which require further research. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Developing TRIZ, Altshuller created an extremely potential background
for further studies in every direction. He and his associates attempted to bring all four
categories together in a problem-solving technique, known as the Algoritm of Inventive
Problem Solving (ARIZ). Needless to say, ARIZ is the most powerful TRIZ tool aimed at
solving most tough inventive problems that involve physical contradictions.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, the approach to solving problems introduced by Altshuller
expands to other, non-technological areas. Modern TRIZ should not only be seen as a
methodology for solving engineering problems or a new product development process; main
ideas behind TRIZ become a powerful tool for managing knowledge and solving problems that
contain contradictions in many areas. As reported, many successful results were obtained
in solving social, business, marketing, and managerial problems. In the recent past, I
also had very successful experience with using TRIZ concepts to solve business problems,
which previously seemed unsolvable because any known solution did not eliminate a core
contradiction. This is possible due to generic nature of TRIZ, which organizes thinking in
a systematic and non-blinded by mental inertia ways and proposes patterns for innovative
change. </p>
