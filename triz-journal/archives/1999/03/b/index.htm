<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">INTRODUCTION</u></b> A history of systems, techniques and approaches
for solving problems is presented in the book<i><b>, Birth of an Invention</b></i><sup>(1)</sup>
published in 1995 in Moscow. That book contains a diagram indicating that the TRIZ
approach continues to be developed. A recent paper<sup>(2)</sup> on &quot;Triads&quot;
presents another powerful problem-solving approach. Each of these approaches lies
somewhere on the set of S-curves<sup>(3,4)</sup> for &quot;systems used to solve
problems.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult for users and developers of an old technical system to
welcome new systems when they come along. This is certainly the case with the TRIZ
approach, which itself comprises a &quot;technical system.&quot; Users skilled in this
problem-solving approach may tend to believe that the system they are currently using is
&quot;the ultimate.&quot; But progress stops for no-one. The idea of system evolution
means that &quot;something better is coming along&quot; - something that corrects the
deficiencies of the current approach, and offers greater functional performance than the
previous system. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ is an &quot;old&quot; system<sup>(5,6)</sup>, having been under
development and in use for over fifty years. Although it is still relatively new in
western nations, its status on the TRIZ S-curve is one of a &quot;mature&quot; approach.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One sign that TRIZ is a mature system is that its performance is being
enhanced by the use of software<sup>(7)</sup>, which merely accelerates the
problem-solving process. Another sign that the TRIZ system is mature is the current demand
by some practicing TRIZniks for &quot;standardization.&quot; It is to be expected that a
new, &quot;breakthrough&quot; approach<sup>(8)</sup> will replace all or parts of the TRIZ
approach.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Corporations that field products don&#146;t really care whether a new
system replaces TRIZ, or not. What they care about is their capability to rapidly and
effectively solve problems, and to conceive breakthrough designs<sup>(9,10)</sup>. Such
capabilities will significantly assist them in their business!</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The author is continually asked by his corporate clients: &quot;What
new and better problem-solving systems are on the horizon?&quot; &quot;What systems will
replace, or significantly improve upon, the performance of TRIZ?&quot; &quot;What&#146;s
beyond TRIZ?&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of this paper is to examine:</p>

</p><ol>
  <li>Some of the key capabilities of TRIZ.</li>
  <li>Areas of TRIZ that need improvement<sup>(11)</sup> (i.e., &quot;deficiencies&quot; of
    the current TRIZ approach).</li>
  <li>Competing or better problem-solving approaches that can replace or be integrated with
    the TRIZ approach.</li>
  <li>Directions that current developers are already taking from the &quot;Classic TRIZ&quot;
    approach.</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before addressing these four areas, the history of the TRIZ approach
will be very briefly presented.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b></u>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u><b>HISTORY OF TRIZ AND ITS INTRODUCTION TO THE WEST</b></u> The
story of TRIZ is interesting and unusual. Its history has been written in various Russian
sources for Russian readership, but not much of it has been presented in English.</p>

</p><ol>
  <li>When TRIZ first appeared, it was superior to existing problem-solving approaches, but it
    was developed in a country - the former USSR - whose government did not appreciate it, nor
    even support it to any great degree. TRIZ was politically in disfavor with the established
    government (and therefore, with government-run organizations) for an appreciable time.
    From one perspective, it was an &quot;underground&quot; movement, academic and
    intellectual in nature. Perhaps this was precisely the environment that would support the
    development of such a brilliant approach.</li>
  <li>TRIZ could not be employed to support mainstream, commercial technology in the former
    USSR, because for all essential purposes, there was no widespread commercial (free
    enterprise) technology there. The ability to establish and run a business was prohibited.
    Determining and satisfying the needs of customers was also an idea that was neither
    practical in, nor part of the culture of the former USSR.</li>
  <li>It was not until much later, upon its exportation to western countries, that TRIZ could
    be broadly tested by applying it to a wide range of technologies and an expanded range of
    products (for example, the former database of TRIZ was quite deficient in
    &quot;electronic&quot; effects and electronic products; it was not until TRIZ came to the
    USA that this part of the TRIZ database was seriously updated). By that time, TRIZ was
    nearly forty years old (dating from its initial discovery by Altshuller in the late
    1940&#146;s).</li>
  <li>When the TRIZ approach began to catch the attention of corporations in the early
    1990&#146;s, its comprehensive power and brilliant capabilities were immediately
    recognized by only a few westerners - including the author. Virtually no corporations, and
    few individuals in the mainstream technical world, had even heard about it. Even today,
    most western corporations either have not heard of TRIZ, or do not understand what it is.
    In the United States, TRIZ is &quot;in its infancy&quot; as a problem-solving, creative
    approach.</li>
  <li>The first TRIZ educational opportunities for industry in the U.S. were very limited.
    There were public TRIZ introductory courses given for industry at the University of
    Connecticut. Instructors at these courses were brilliant and highly knowledgeable in TRIZ.
    Their marketing &amp; training approach, however, was less than optimal. TRIZ did not
    &quot;catch on&quot; rapidly in the early 1990&#146;s. This was another indication that
    TRIZ was - and still is - in its infancy in the U.S.</li>
  <li>Yet another reason for the slow start of the adoption of TRIZ in the U.S. was the making
    of wild promises, and the overly-aggressive, &quot;get rich quickly&quot; behavior on the
    part of a few TRIZ organizations doing business with client organizations and investors.
    One &quot;pioneering&quot; U.S. corporation privately disclosed that because of this,
    their corporation had already developed a &quot;bitter taste&quot; for TRIZ. This
    represented a slight setback for TRIZ - even though the approach itself is very powerful.
    A &quot;buyer beware&quot; attitude still prevails in a portion of the potential TRIZ
    marketplace.</li>
  <li>In those early days of TRIZ in the United States, two firms<sup>(13)</sup> - recently
    referred to in Fortune Magazine - entered the TRIZ marketplace with the goal of providing
    high quality products and services for customers. One was the author&#146;s firm,
    Renaissance Leadership Institute (RLI), which began offering public and in-company TRIZ
    training and consulting to corporate professionals in 1991, and established a TRIZ
    executive overview session for Executives at Cal Tech&#146;s Industrial Relations Center,
    in Pasadena, California<sup>(12)</sup>. That course introduced hundreds of corporate
    executives to the TRIZ approach. </li>
  <li>The other firm that entered the American marketplace in the early 1990&#146;s, Invention
    Machine Corporation, initiated a program to develop various TRIZ software packages that
    are now on sale worldwide. In a rather daring move for a group schooled in the classical
    TRIZ approach, IMC abandoned the use of the name &quot;TRIZ&quot; in marketing their
    software products, and took a &quot;functional analysis&quot; approach to problem-solving.
    Their software is, however, based upon a TRIZ foundation, but it also has much value added
    because of the manner in which functional analysis has been applied to conventional TRIZ
    techniques. More will be said about Invention Machine&#146;s products later in this
    article.</li>
  <li>Another entry in the early 1990&#146;s offering TRIZ training was ASI, the co-sponsor of
    this conference. ASI is famous for having introduced the North American automotive world,
    and later many other industries, to the Taguchi Methods. Therefore it seemed natural for
    them to initiate TRIZ training.</li>
  <li>Since those early years, the author has brought TRIZ Certification, advanced TRIZ, and
    TRIZ Technology Forecasting to the American marketplace; a few corporations, including
    Melroe-Ingersoll Rand, have been using these approaches to advantage.</li>
  <li>In 1996, the author and Dr. Ellen Domb formed the TRIZ Institute - the co-sponsor of
    this conference - and gave birth to the TRIZ Journal on the world wide web. Since that
    time, the whole world has become aware of the TRIZ approach. </li>
  <li>In the current year - 1998 - there are over a dozen legitimate TRIZ consulting and
    training firms, but the TRIZ approach is still in its infancy in terms of its practice by
    corporations in the U.S. and in western Europe. Of the more than a dozen TRIZ consulting
    and training firms, only a few have the capability of teaching and applying TRIZ at the
    highest levels.</li>
  <li>Those few companies<sup>(14,15)</sup> who have learned to use TRIZ well are receiving
    many benefits. One of these, the author&#146;s client, is Ingersoll-Rand&#146;s Melroe
    Company, maker of the Bobcat and other series of products. This company is one of very few
    organizations who know how - on an in-house basis - to successfully employ leading-edge
    tools and approaches (including TRIZ, QFD and Robust Design) in an integrated way in their
    total product development process. Their company initiative began, and continues to be
    supported, by top management from Melroe&#146;s headquarters in North Dakota. One part of
    the success of this company is the establishment of a group of &quot;internal
    consultants,&quot; each with expertise in one or more of the leading-edge design tools
    and/or management approaches. The Melroe Company is scheduled to give a paper on some of
    their TRIZ activities at this conference.</li>
</ol>

<p><u><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SOME LIMITATIONS AND PROBLEMS OF TRIZ</b></u> Several articles and a
few books have appeared<sup>(16)</sup> citing the advantages of the TRIZ approach; very
few of these have examined TRIZ with a critical eye. Let&#146;s take a look at some of the
limitations, deficiencies and problems associated with the TRIZ approach - including TRIZ
training and software.</p>
<b><u>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Complexity</u> </b>The primary procedure of TRIZ for solving
&#145;Inventive-type&quot; problems is called ARIZ - Algorithm for the Solution of
Inventive-type Problems. The use of ARIZ is highly effective. The author and his clients
use it to solve very difficult problems. But if ARIZ is to be judged by the same criteria
with which we judge other technical procedures, it has to be stated that &quot;ARIZ is a
very complex system that is not easy to learn in a relatively short time.&quot; Some
TRIZniks will argue, &quot;Oh, but I teach it very effectively,&quot; or, &quot;What do
you expect? A student has to make efforts to learn something worthwhile!&quot; There is
certainly some truth to these statements. However, the very &quot;best&quot; systems are
not overly complex, nor are they overly difficult and time-consuming to learn. In this
sense, they are &quot;elegant&quot; systems. The response to this challenge must be
&quot;simplify the system,&quot; and that&#146;s precisely what TRIZ developers and
instructors have been doing over the past several decades.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">System Representation by Substance-Fields</b></u> Substance-field
analysis and substance-field models are employed in TRIZ to illuminate and clarify the
problem, and to facilitate the search for solutions. According to TRIZ, a substance-field
represents a technical system (in fact, it represents a <i>function</i> of a technical
system). A real problem with substance-fields, however, is that they inadequately describe
the essential system elements, or parts, required for the function to exist<sup>(17)</sup>.
Because of this, the domain of solution possibilities is artificially restricted. The TRIZ
approach, when used with substance-fields alone, will not always lead a problem-solver to
certain high-level solutions.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A substance-field, as it is defined in TRIZ, is both a brilliant and a
useful concept, but it does not go far enough. What a substance-field model typically
represents is an interaction between two system objects. Understood in this way,
substance-field models are useful to problem-solvers. They become even more useful,
however, when the problem solver applies &quot;Triads.&quot;<sup>(2)</sup>. A Triad
adequately represents a system function, and includes within itself up to three
substance-fields.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may appear from the above discussion that a Triad is not much
different from an S-Field, but to practitioners who understand and use S-Fields and Triads
in an integrated way, problem-solving is significantly enhanced. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Personal Creativity</b></u> One of the claims of TRIZ is that its
practice leads to breakthroughs in the way that people think. The practice of TRIZ
actually changes personal creativity in a powerful way, significantly expanding the
mind&#146;s capacity. This is a result of the application and understanding of TRIZ
philosophy and practices.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A series of exercises and practices have been created by TRIZniks -
aimed at increasing the mind&#146;s creative powers<sup>(1)</sup>. This approach leads to
a &quot;creative personality.&quot; The practice of TRIZ, however, tends to increase
creative capacity without significantly raising the &quot;level&quot; of personal
creativity. There already exist extensive tools and techniques for expanding creativity,
and these are a part of the TRIZ approach. In the author&#146;s opinion, however, these
primarily expand the practitioner&#146;s creative powers in a &quot;lateral&quot;
direction and not in a &quot;vertical&quot; direction.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Successor systems to TRIZ will go further in developing higher levels
of personal creativity - tapping human potential that TRIZ has left un-tapped.
Next-generation creativity systems will be based upon a superior understanding of human
psychology. Right from the inception of TRIZ, human psychology was dismissed because it
did not lead to an understanding of creativity and problem-solving.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The author has personally verified the importance of a practical
understanding of human psychology as a means of significantly increasing personal
creativity<sup>(18)</sup>. Certain psychological practices and exercises do indeed lead to
developing higher creative powers<sup>(19)</sup>. These practices and exercises will
probably be a part of next-generation creativity systems.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Psychological Inertia</b></u> Psychological inertia (PI) is a concept
that was discovered by Altshuller, and later elaborated upon by Zlotin and Kowalick<sup>(20,
21, 22)</sup>. PI is a powerful concept that very accurately describes impediments to
higher thinking. PI is discussed in this paper from the standpoint of current
problem-solving systems. In the TRIZ approach PI is presented as the <i>main</i> barrier
to creative thinking. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the problems with the TRIZ philosophy is that it fails to
present PI in an organized way. Furthermore, PI&#146;s relationship with human functions
has not been well established<sup>(21, 22)</sup>.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Future problem-solving systems will recognize PI as only one of several
major barriers to creative problem-solving. Two additional barriers are quite prominent in
human beings, so they need to be discussed further. These barriers are &quot;ordinary
imagination&quot; and &quot;identification.&quot;<sup>(23)</sup></p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ordinary Imagination</b></u> A major barrier to creativity (besides PI)
is &quot;ordinary imagination,&quot;<sup>(24)</sup> which is really a form of
&quot;day-dreaming&quot; or uncontrolled wandering of the mind. This happens to almost all
people, almost all of the time. Those who are trapped in it have little chance of
observing its harmful effects on creativity. It&#146;s possible, however, to observe it
and to work against it.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While quietly driving a car alone, it may be possible to realize that
the same thoughts, about the same types of subjects, keep flowing through one&#146;s mind
- over and over and over. The subject matter may differ from person to person, but for
each person, the same so-called &quot;thoughts&quot; get repeated. This is the
uncontrolled process of ordinary imagination. It requires a certain &quot;energy&quot; in
order to operate; this energy is taken from a limited reservoir of creative energy.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The loss of (human) creative energy to ordinary imagination means that
less energy is available for higher and more creative functions. Ordinary imagination is
so potent because it is uncontrolled - it &quot;just &quot;happens to&quot; human beings
without their intention. There are exercises<sup>(19)</sup> that have the object of
escaping from ordinary imagination; these exercises work, and they will be a part of
successor systems to TRIZ. It should be emphasized here that ordinary imagination is quite
different from &quot;creative imagination&quot; - the former process is uncontrolled, and
the latter process controlled.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Identification</b></u> Another major impediment to creativity (besides
PI) is the power of objects, thoughts, emotions, persons, concepts, and situations in
general to attract the attention of human beings, leaving them unable to apply attention
in a creative, intentional way. Like ordinary imagination this robs them of energy that
could have been available for higher and more creative functions. A word that aptly
describes this process is &quot;identification,&quot;<sup>(24)</sup> meaning that the
power of the object, thought, emotion, other person, etc., is so strong, that the
&quot;victim&quot; actually <i>becomes </i>the object of thought, emotion, other person,
etc., to which he is attracted. It&#146;s very easy to think of hundreds of examples of
this creativity-inhibiting process in everyday life.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an example of identification, the author recently saw the driver of
an automobile standing next to one of the tires that was flat, kicking it and shouting at
the tire in a loud voice - as if the tire could hear him! The tire did get its
&quot;revenge,&quot; however: it robbed the driver of energy that the driver could have
used in a more intelligent fashion. The same is true for any objects, thoughts, emotions,
people, etc., with which an individual becomes &quot;identified.&quot; Losing one&#146;s
control at meetings, for example, results in the same loss of energy. It is a
contradiction: even fairly creative people could be far more creative, if they were simply
able to control their tempers! It is usually not possible for them to change, however,
because they are often &quot;in love with&quot; their tempers.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other barriers to creativity than ordinary imagination and
identification. .A full understanding of what these barriers are, how they operate, and
how to work against them or eliminate them, leads to higher creative powers. Successor
systems to TRIZ will be based upon overcoming these barriers to creativity.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ Training</b></u> As mentioned in the previous section on
&quot;History,&quot; the training available on the TRIZ approach in the early 1990&#146;s
was relatively ineffective. There were several reasons for this, one being that it was
simply not provided in good English, making it quite difficult for English-speaking
students to understand. Secondly, the training materials were far from clear. A third
reason was that the training was not experiential, i.e., only case studies were provided
during the training; it was not possible, during the training, to work on &quot;real&quot;
problems brought to the training session by the participants.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been changing considerably because of customer demand - but
some of the early, original providers of TRIZ training have changed slowly or not at all.
The greatest positive change in TRIZ training has been made by those training providers
who conduct <i><b>experiential</b></i> TRIZ sessions, where participants bring real
problems and design challenges to the training session, and leave with solution concepts -
often patentable.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next-generation problem-solving systems have to make the
problem-solving process more rapid than do today&#146;s systems (i.e., brainstorming,
trial and error, and TRIZ). Training sessions have to be experiential - meaning that
participants leave the training with more than just knowledge. Participants have to leave
the sessions with the experience of working on, and solving, real problems that are of
interest to them. These demands call for greater absorption of information and shorter
training periods.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Creativity Software</b></u> A contradiction exists in the world of
inventive software. As of this date, two key parameters characterize TRIZ software:
quality and price. The contradiction is that, in a marketplace where there is little
competition, available software (higher-quality software that the public has a keen
interest in purchasing) has historically been out of the price-range reach of those for
whom it could be of the greatest benefit. Another problem with inventive software is that
it is still not &quot;user-friendly&quot; enough.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Invention and problem-solving software of the future must be more
user-friendly to users, and must offer more value than does current software. Software
also has to have an element of &quot;fun&quot; in it! Graphics have to be excellent, with
animation appropriately provided. Tutorials must cover not only &quot;How to use the
software,&quot; but also give a background of the basic creativity approaches upon which
the software is based. Use of software must be made self-evident by the tutorials - not
requiring a separate &quot;training package&quot; in order for the practitioner to
&quot;understand&quot; the software.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Software prices must appeal to a high-volume-based marketplace,
including prices within the reach of small and middle-sized companies and individuals.
This means that invention software packages must sell for $1200 or less (author&#146;s
estimate). Organizations that are able to provide such software will capture the largest
shares in a marketplace that does not yet exist (a large number of potential users are
still unaware of the capabilities of today&#146;s problem-solving approaches).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The author&#146;s company (Renaissance Leadership Institute) has
created inventive algorithm templates to use with client companies. These templates are
available as software and are very effective in assisting technical professionals in
solving problems. The templates are &quot;functionally&quot; based, meaning that the
practitioner has to have gone through certain initial steps of problem analysis and
definition, culminating in the function to be addressed. Once the practitioner has
accomplished this, the algorithm template &quot;takes over&quot; from there, offering
either (1) generic, inventive solution prompts, or (2) suggestions that &quot;steer&quot;
the practitioner along a specific creative path.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One template offers assistance in the problem-selection stage by
generating a functional relationship diagram together with an assemblage of goal
statements that can be prioritized by a technical team - in terms of payoff-to-risk ratio
and market (and business) relevance. When this template was used by a computer software
company, they derived several alternative solutions to a problem involving employee
retention.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another template offers solution prompts for a selected function to be
improved - based upon each of the forty inventive principles. When these prompts were
applied to the transdermal patch system problem of &quot;How to deliver certain drug
molecules through the skin layer, and into the blood stream?&quot;, these prompts
contained several &quot;gems,&quot; each of which was employed in the best solution.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet another template offers solution prompts from a &quot;technology
forecasting&quot; point of view. These prompts are based upon the eleven &quot;Laws of
Development of Technical Systems.&quot; A complementary template to that one goes into
more detail, generating generic inventive prompts based upon key operations that occur as
a technical system evolves over its &quot;lifetime.&quot; This template was one of the
most effective of all the templates for the technical staff of a corporation who conducted
technology forecasting on a hydraulic system.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, two additional templates act as &quot;inventive memory
jogs&quot; - forcing the practitioner to consider the idea that all technical systems have
four major &quot;parts,&quot; and that all technical systems have the potential for moving
through four &quot;stages&quot; during their lifetimes. These latter two templates cause
the practitioner to consider &quot;weak points&quot; or &quot;inventive
opportunities&quot; regarding his/her technical system.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problem-Solving Procedural Philosophy</b></u> The TRIZ approach to
problem-solving is a focused approach leading rather directly to a so-called
&quot;best&quot; solution (or to a few &quot;best&quot; solutions) - depending upon the
constraints relative to the problem situation. TRIZ tends to dismiss procedures that
involve:</p>

</p><ol>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Generation of &quot;many possible solutions,&quot; followed by</li>
    <li VALUE="2">A screening and selection procedure.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The author and his clients have found that proceeding only with a
relatively linear approach is not only rather arbitrary, but also tends to miss some
rather excellent solution possibilities. The use of tools like mind-mapping and Pugh
Analysis, along with TRIZ, significantly accelerates multi-path problem-solving
approaches, and leads to higher-level solutions.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The TRIZ solution procedure is not &quot;bad,&quot; but it is not the
only, or even the best, procedure for obtaining a high-level solution. Several paths are
better than one path - as long as the &quot;several paths&quot; can be traveled in a
timely and cost-effective way, and as long as the levels of solutions obtained are high.
The use of invention software, mind-mapping, Pugh Analysis and other well known tools
makes the &quot;multi-path&quot; approach quite feasible, and results in high-level
solutions.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Applying the Effects of Physics, Chemistry and Geometry in an Inventive
Way</b></u> The TRIZ database includes many case-study examples indicating how various
physical, chemical and geometrical effects can be used in an inventive way to achieve the
(invented) result. These effects are related to required system actions and functions, to
each other, to fields, to &quot;substances&quot; and in several other ways. The
problem-solver or inventor applies these effects to his problem.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is one area of TRIZ where much progress has been made in the
United States. The effects and the relationships described above have been compressed into
a rather brilliant database that is far more user friendly than the &quot;effects&quot;
approach was previously. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Future approaches will take the &quot;effects&quot; database several
steps further, and will be significantly more user-friendly. These approaches will be more
tailored and customized to users&#146; needs - operate more like an expert system, solicit
information from the user, and customize the output to the user&#146;s specific goals.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Functional Analysis</b></u> Functional analysis is really not a part of
TRIZ, but is used in conjunction with the TRIZ approach (substance-field analysis is
really an advanced form of functional analysis). There have been two major directions of
growth of functional analysis, as it relates to the TRIZ approach:</p>

</p><ol>
  <li>The Invention Machine Corporation abandoned the use of substance-field analysis in their
    later software, and adopted a more pure, functional analysis approach, that employs the
    standardized functional language of artificial intelligence. Their software has retained
    the laws of development of technical systems. Their &quot;Predictions&quot; program is
    indeed based upon the &quot;standard solution approach&quot; of TRIZ - although the
    standard solution approach is not cited by them as the source of this program.</li>
  <li>Several U.S. organizations have adopted the flow-chart relationship diagram as a tool
    for indicating both useful and undesirable (or &quot;harmful&quot;) interactions between
    events or parts of a system. These are very powerful because they give a clear picture of
    the system(s) of interest; they present options for problem-solving and goal selection;
    and they can even be used to generate high-level goal statements. The goal statements can
    be employed in various ways.</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Search for a Superior Creative Process</b></u> In the early formative
years of TRIZ, Altshuller had the idea that an improved problem-solving process could be
developed by studying the results of the efforts of problem-solvers, and then carefully
observing and analyzing those results to detect laws and patterns. This is the classic
approach of science: the inference of generalized conclusions (laws and patterns) from
particular instances (e.g., many specific inventions from the global patent database). The
work of Altshuller and his associates is extraordinary both in its scope and in its depth.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Altshuller&#146;s search was for &quot;the science of creativity.&quot;
He chose to follow <i>one path</i> in conducting that search: looking for laws and
principles and patterns based upon the results of creativity. He abandoned the path of
using an understanding of human psychology to discover the creative process, in favor of
the &quot;results&quot; path.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Creativity&quot; according to the gospel of TRIZ, is the
knowledge and use of the TRIZ approach, with its various tools, techniques, and
procedures. In fact, however, these creative procedures, tools and techniques do not
represent creativity itself! Creativity still remains a mystery. Admittedly, in his later
life, Altshuller set out to study the &quot;creative personality&quot; and how it could be
developed - but the approach taken in that study still did not lead to real secrets of
creativity.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A better understanding of creativity itself leads to superior
problem-solving and to superior creative designs. The &quot;human system&quot; has
sub-systems that make creativity possible. Human beings are capable of working in a
creative way at much higher levels of creativity than they ordinarily do. This is a fact
that has been demonstrated many times in instances of so-called &quot;enlightenment.&quot;
Such conditions, however brief and unexplainable they may be, are instances of
higher-level intelligence.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A three-part question that needs to be asked is: &quot;How can the
condition referred to as creative &#145;enlightenment&#146; be increased in duration, in
frequency, and in depth?&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The TRIZ approach is based upon techniques, patterns and procedures
that contribute to a person&#146;s creative <i>capacity</i>, without significantly raising
the <i>level</i> of creativity of the mind itself. TRIZ is indeed a &quot;science of
creativity.&quot; Raising the level of creativity of the mind, however, is not dependent
upon analyzing the creative results of others. It requires raising one&#146;s own, innate
intelligence - opening the doors that act as barriers to higher-level thinking.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next-generation problem-solving approaches will be based upon
higher-level thinking. Higher-level thinking can be achieved by increasing the frequency,
duration, and depth of higher levels of mind activity. Next-generation approaches can be
expected to be significantly more powerful than the TRIZ approach. These approaches will
include certain exercises and practices<sup>(19)</sup> that lead to higher human
creativity.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are these practices and exercises? They fall into two general
categories:</p>

</p><ol>
  <li>Practices and exercises for eliminating, reducing, or preventing barriers to
    higher-level thinking.</li>
  <li>Practices and exercises for increasing the level of creative thinking.</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The former category includes techniques for eliminating losses of
creative energy. The latter category includes techniques for increasing the
&quot;productivity&quot; of the creative energy itself.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The author has been interested in this general area (raising the level
of human creativity) for over twenty years. Not only do such techniques already exist -
they have existed for quite some time. One historical person who knew about, and practiced
some of these techniques, was Leonardo da Vinci (a careful analysis of his notebooks<sup>(25)</sup>
will reveal some of these). Although other historical persons also possessed some of these
capabilities, it is not possible to adequately discover what these capabilities are,
simply by studying the major &quot;events&quot; and &quot;trends&quot; in the lives of
such creative persons. There are, however, other techniques for discovering these secrets.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEW PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACHES AND ADVANCED DEVELOPMENTS</b></u> TRIZ,
brainstorming and the trial and error approach each have a history of over one-hundred
years of development. The development of TRIZ is well documented<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Brain-Mapping ( A Result of the Evolution of Brainstorming)</b></u> Not
so well documented, perhaps, are the more recent developments of brainstorming, which have
made this creativity tool even more powerful and rapid.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One outstanding development of brainstorming, called
&quot;Brain-Mapping,&quot; makes brainstorming far more powerful. Brain-Mapping is the
result of merging the original form of brainstorming with one of the tools of quality
control - the fishbone diagram (also called the &quot;cause and effect&quot; diagram and
the Ishikawa diagram). The author recently used Brain-Mapping to assist him in completely
re-engineering his two-day TRIZ executive course at Cal Tech. He began with a simple
Brain-Map, and ended with a rather thorough Brain-Map of the course contents. This
Brain-Mapping was useful not only in developing all aspects of the re-engineered TRIZ
course, but also in establishing a course outline. The author&#146;s Brain-Map results are
shown below in the following two figures.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image128.gif" border="1" WIDTH="630" HEIGHT="474"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Brain-map shown above began with the subject of
&quot;creativity&quot; and branched out in several directions, addressing the following
topics: Applications of Creativity; About Problems; The Theory of Personal Creativity;
Barriers to Creativity; and Creative Approaches. Some of these &quot;main topics&quot;
were then further divided into other topics. For example, the Theory of Personal
Creativity was divided into the subjects of &quot;Brain Centers &amp; Functions,&quot;
Personality, and Essence. The subject &quot;Creative Approaches&quot; was further divided
into &quot;Traditional and Ordinary Approaches,&quot; &quot;New and Revolutionary
Approaches,&quot; and &quot;Integration of TRIZ with Other Approaches.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These in turn pointed towards further divisions and subdivisions, until
a more complete Brain-Map (shown below) was established.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image129.gif" border="1" WIDTH="630" HEIGHT="490"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Brain-Mapping is combined with various aspects of the TRIZ
approach, the combined results are even more powerful. Such a merged system has been used
privately with remarkable success by the Melroe-Ingersoll Rand Company - who as mentioned
above, is presenting a paper at this conference. The author will not further discuss this
combined use because of its proprietary nature.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Triads</b></u> Triads is the latest development in problem-solving
systems<sup>(2)</sup>. Triads discards none of the previous problem-solving approaches. In
fact, it is usually applied together with the previous problem-solving approaches
(including TRIZ) in an integrated way - resulting in high-level solutions and
next-generation designs. Design solutions are rapidly achieved. The latest version of
Triads has been developed by the author and his firm, Renaissance Leadership Institute.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A brief example will acquaint the reader with Triads from an
&quot;overview&quot; perspective. Consider the problem of thoroughly cleaning the inside
of a network of interconnected, stainless-steel pipes. The system has to be spotless and
completely dry after the cleaning process is over. The present system makes use of a
high-pressure, aqueous detergent solution, followed by a water rinse, a steam rinse, and
then hot air-drying. The &quot;time bottleneck&quot; in the process is the hot air drying
stage. Hot air drying takes far too long. The problem is to reduce the entire cleaning
cycle time without complicating the system or adding additional cost. Another constraint
is that the steam rinse is a necessity in order to completely sterilize the interior of
the piping network.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Analysis of the problem situation after the steam rinse states a goal
as &quot;Increasing the rate of internal drying of drops of clean, residue water remaining
from the steam rinse.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Analysis of the problem situation after the water rinse states a goal
as &quot;Having no drops of clean, residue water present as a result of applying the steam
subsequent to the water rinse.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the second goal statement appears to be more difficult, this
is the problem to which the Triads approach was applied. It is a law that all functions -
in order to exist - must be composed of three objects: a passive object; an active object;
and an enabling object. The passive object is that object that gets &quot;worked on,
changed, modified, eliminated, etc.&quot; by the active object. The enabling object is
that object, without which the desired interaction between the active and passive objects
will not occur.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this case, drops of residual water (passive object) exist inside the
pipeline as a result of the water rinse. These drops must be eliminated. As given in the
problem, the steam (active object) enters the pipeline, sterilizes the interior walls, and
moves some water through the system - but residual water remains. The desired interaction
between the active and passive objects is &quot;Steam completely eliminates residual
water.&quot; This is not occurring, however.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the &quot;enabling object&quot; for this inadequate function?
Another way of asking this question is: What is the object, without which the steam and
residual water drops will not interact in the desired way (i.e., eliminating residual
water drops)? It may not be obvious, but the enabling object is the &quot;container
system&quot; that contains the residual water and the steam. Without a container system
(i.e., pipes, and vessel for steam), the residual water drops and the steam will not come
into contact with each other. The resulting triad is illustrated below.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image130.gif" border="0" WIDTH="590" HEIGHT="219"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note that this triad contains three interactions (each of which could
be considered to be an S-Field).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Returning to the problem: more and better sterilization is not the
problem for this &quot;already existing&quot; system. The problem is how to eliminate
residual water (the existing system shown above partially eliminates residual water by
carrying it away in a liquid and vapor form). This &quot;partial but inadequate
fulfillment&quot; of the &quot;residual water elimination&quot; function is indicated by a
dashed interaction line between the steam and the residual water drops.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This graphic triad already suggests some generic solutions: 1) Change
the nature of the containment system; 2) Change the nature of the steam itself. In what
ways could the nature of the containment system, and/or the steam, be changed in order to
&quot;eliminate more residual water?&quot; The answer is: &quot;In ways that motivate the
water to leave!&quot; Let&#146;s consider just a couple of these <u>generic ways</u>:</p>

<ol TYPE="A">
  <li>Modify the container system in some way so that it becomes a vacuum, attracting residual
    water drops out of the system.</li>
  <li>Modify the steam in some way so that it attracts and carries away all the residual
    water.</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just these two generic solutions lead to several more <u>specific
solutions</u>:</p>

<ol type="A" start="3">
  <li>Add a vacuum chamber to the container system. It will cause the water droplets to
    evaporate and reduce the time of drying.</li>
  <li>Heat the container system. It will cause residual water to evaporate, and will reduce
    the time of drying.</li>
  <li>Heat the already-existing steam vessel, causing the steam to enter the pipeline in a
    &quot;superheated&quot; state, automatically and locally absorbing all residual water
    droplets!</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Specific solutions C and D may be costly and may further complicate the
system. But solution E is excellent, because it uses existing system resources and uses
energy very efficiently. No follow-on &quot;hot air drying&quot; stage is required! The
drying time goes from a very long time to very rapid.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note: the use of a Triad in this challenging problem caused several
solution possibilities to become more or less obvious to the problem-solvers. Had specific
solutions not been so obvious, each of the three interactions in the triad could have been
analyzed as S-Fields, using the various TRIZ solution techniques to arrive at candidate
solution(s). The efficiency of problem-solving, and the productivity of problem-solving is
significantly increased when problem-solvers and designers apply the Triads approach -
together with any other solution approaches and tools as required.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From a &quot;physical contradiction&quot; point of view, this problem
could be stated as: &quot;Hot air is wanted (for drying purposes) but hot air is not
wanted (for drying time reasons).&quot; From one point of view, the ideal final result
involved merging the &quot;sterilizing and drying&quot; stages, combining them into one
system: &quot;Super-heated steam!&quot; (saturated steam and non-saturated steam, all in
one). By such merging, the process time was significantly compressed, and the need for a
final hot-air stage was eliminated.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The author considers the Triads approach to be a
&quot;super-system&quot; approach that brings together other approaches (including TRIZ)
in a more effective way. In this sense it is the &quot;parent&quot; approach of the other
problem-solving approaches.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Use of Triads to Solve &quot;Traditional&quot; TRIZ and ARIZ Teaching
Problems</b></u> Two classic problems have been used by TRIZ experts to teach TRIZ and
ARIZ to students:</p>

</p><ol>
  </p><ol>
    <li>A solid, hermetically sealed metal vessel is used for carrying out experiments in which
      aggressive liquids react with various metal alloys in the form of small cubes. This
      reaction vessel must not react with the aggressive liquids, so it is very expensive. It is
      desirable to not have to use this vessel. What can be done?</li>
    <li>A radio antenna receives radio waves, but needs to be protected from lightning. However,
      when a lightning rod is used, it unfavorably interacts with the incoming radio signals. If
      no lightning rod is used, lightning could destroy the radio antenna. What can be done?</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his famous book, <i><b>Creativity as an Exact Science</b></i><sup>(26)</sup>,
Altshuller describes the long and various steps of ARIZ (Algorithm of the Solution of
Inventive-type Problems) that students have to learn to go through (citing various rules
associated with each step), in order to solve these problems. He emphasizes that there are
many pitfalls that will take students away from the best solution. He also states that
there is only one solution to the first problem (the hermetically sealed vessel problem).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The use of Triads<sup>(2)</sup> greatly simplifies the solution of
these problems.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the first problem, the active object is the &quot;Aggressive
Liquid&quot; and the passive objects is a &quot;Metal Cube.&quot; The interaction can be
described as &quot;<u>Aggressive Liquid</u> <u>Reacts With</u> <u>Metal Cube</u>.&quot;
But this reaction cannot occur without an &quot;enabling object&quot; to bring the liquid
and the cube together in a way that they can contact each other in order to react. This
&quot;enabling object&quot; is the &quot;Expensive Metal Vessel.&quot; The Triad looks
like this:</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image131.gif" border="1" WIDTH="428" HEIGHT="221"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem is that the expensive metal vessel is undesirable.
Therefore it can be &quot;pruned&quot;<sup>(17)</sup>. Unfortunately, however, the
function (triad) of an aggressive liquid reacting with metal cubes or selected metal
alloys will not occur unless there are three objects making up the function (i.e., active,
passive and enabling). If the expensive metal vessel is &quot;pruned,&quot; then some
other object has to replace its functions of &quot;containment&quot; and
&quot;enclosure&quot; (as indicated in the Triad shown above). The most likely objects to
do this would be either the metal cubes themselves, or the aggressive liquid. Each of
these are, in fact, solutions. Let'&#146; examine the &quot;Triads&quot; for these
solutions (shown below):</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image132.gif" border="1" WIDTH="638" HEIGHT="268"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution A (above) is simple: the alloy to be tested is formed into a
&quot;container&quot; shape (the enabling object), which contains the aggressive liquid
(the active object), which in turn reacts with the walls of the alloy to be tested (the
passive object).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solution B (above) is also simple: the aggressive liquid is frozen to a
solid having a &quot;container&quot; shape (the enabling object), which contains the
liquid form of the &quot;aggressive liquid&quot; (i.e., the active object), which in turn
reacts with the metal alloy cubes (the passive object).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contrary to the statements made by Altshuller in his book<sup>(26)</sup>,
there are two solutions - not just one! This particular problem has been used for years to
teach TRIZ students.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Either of the solutions described above may be chosen, depending upon
the constraints of the problem (it is likely that solution A is the solution of choice, in
most instances, but this really depends upon the problem constraints!). Please note that
these solutions - using Triads - were quite simple, and they did not require moving
through all the rules and procedures normally associated with the ARIZ procedure to obtain
these solutions. Instead of the more complicated traditional TRIZ/ARIZ procedure, a
combination of Triads and Pruning (one of the operations of functional analysis) was used
in a highly effective manner.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the second problem, the active object is the &quot;Lightning&quot;
and the passive objects is a &quot;Lightning Rod,&quot; which is meant to attract the
lightning - should it strike in the vicinity of the radio antenna. The interaction can be
described as &quot;<u>Lightning</u> <u>Strikes</u> <u>Lightning Rod</u>.&quot; But this
reaction cannot occur without an &quot;enabling object&quot; to bring the lightning and
the lightning rod together. This &quot;enabling object&quot; is the &quot;media&quot; or
ionized air that the lightning must travel through. The Triad looks like this:</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image133.gif" border="0" WIDTH="436" HEIGHT="221"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem is that the lightning rod cannot be employed because of the
&quot;harmful effect&quot; it has on radio wave reception. Therefore the lightning rod has
to be &quot;pruned&quot;<sup>(17)</sup>. Unfortunately, however, the function (triad) of
&quot;lightning striking a lightning rod, instead of a radio antenna&quot; will not occur
unless there are three objects making up this function (i.e., active, passive and
enabling). If the lightning rod is &quot;pruned,&quot; then some other object has to
replace its function of &quot;attracting lightning&quot; (as indicated in the Triad shown
above). The most likely object to do this would be either the lightning itself, or the
ionized air. The ionized air can have the form of an &quot;air tower&quot; that attracts
lightning when the lightning is present (i.e., in the vicinity of the radio antenna). When
there is no lightning, however, the un-ionized air in the air tower will not unfavorably
react with radio wave reception. The problem is solved (the triad is shown below).</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image134.gif" border="0" WIDTH="530" HEIGHT="263"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, the solution is simple: a tower of air (passive object) is
erected nearby the radio antenna. When lightning (active object) occurs, the atmospheric
air (enabling object) around the lightning becomes ionized by the lightning. If the path
of the lightning leads to the vicinity of the radio antenna, the air in the tower becomes
ionized (as a semiconductor) by the lightning, and promptly becomes de-ionized after the
lightning strikes. In this manner, the un-ionized air in the tower poses no threat to
radio reception. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This particular problem, also, has been used for years to teach TRIZ
students. Please note that this solution - using Triads - did not require moving through
all the rules and procedures normally associated with the ARIZ procedure to obtain the
solution. Instead of the more complicated traditional TRIZ/ARIZ procedure, a combination
of Triads and Pruning (one of the operations of functional analysis) was used in a highly
effective manner.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generic Functional Decomposition of a Triad</b></u> Those practiced in
the art of functional analysis regularly subdivide functions into steps that represent a
sequence or a process. In doing this, no two designers will subdivide a system function
the in the same way (i.e., into the same number of identical functional steps.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consider the function, &quot;Repairing a decayed tooth.&quot; This
function can be subdivided into various functional steps, including &quot;drilling out
decayed matter,&quot; &quot;washing out the cavity,&quot; &quot;gathering and preparing
filling-alloy ingredients,&quot; &quot;mixing filling-alloy ingredients,&quot;
&quot;transferring the unhardened alloy to the cavity,&quot; &quot;working the alloy until
it is shaped and hardened inside the tooth,&quot; &quot;grinding/further mechanically
shaping the hardened filling,&quot; and &quot;washing &amp; cleaning the teeth,&quot; as
illustrated below.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image135.gif" border="0" WIDTH="618" HEIGHT="246"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although these eight sequential sub-functions were chosen rather
arbitrarily, they do represent one version of the next level of functions in a
&quot;hierarchical, functional tree diagram&quot; associated with the technical system
called &quot;Tooth Repair.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A question worth asking is: &quot;Is it possible that the number and
sequence of sub-functions chosen could have been universal or &#145;generic&#146;?&quot;
That is, &quot;Is it possible that functional decomposition is generic, and that only one
possible (universal) sequence of sub-functions exists?&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The author has discovered a generic way of decomposing functions into
&quot;standard processes.&quot; The beginning step of generic functional decomposition is
to form a Triad of the primary function. The next step is to form triads for each
&quot;side&quot; interaction in the Triad of the primary function. This process is
illustrated generically in the diagram shown below.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image136.gif" border="0" WIDTH="302" HEIGHT="167"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The original Triad (function) is shown as the central triangle. The
primary interaction of interest is labeled as such. &quot;Completing&quot; the Triads for
each of the side interactions shown, generates two more Triads (functions) - all of which
are necessary for the primary interaction to occur. The trapezoidal figure so generated is
composed of three triangles or seven interactions (each side of a triangle is an
interaction. These seven interactions &quot;comprise&quot; the overal (primary) function.
There is also a certain sequence to these seven interactions (not necessarily the one
shown here). This can be either a logical cause-and-effect sequence or a sequential
sequence, depending upon the particular primary function chosen.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This subject of Triads and Triad decomposition could be the subject of
an entire book. The subject area is still under development by the author. Nevertheless,
there are some important implications from the two &quot;Laws&quot; discussed above (i.e.,
the law of Triads: &quot;All system functions must have three objects in order to be
complete - an active object, a passive object, and an enabling object,&quot; and the law
of Triad Decomposition: &quot;A system function may be able to be subdivided, or
decomposed, into seven generic &#145;sub-functions,&#146; each of which is also a
Triad.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In solving problems or creating an improved system, the system to be
improved often performs one or more functions. Once the designer or problem-solver
determines which function to &quot;improve,&quot; that function can be expressed as a
Triad. This &quot;primary&quot; function may be able to be further divided (decomposed)
into a sequence of functions. If this &quot;sequence of functions&quot; is generic, then
the practitioner can identify which of the sub-functions, if improved, will contribute
most to the improvement of the system as a whole. Functional decomposition organizes
problem-solving by focusing on the &quot;real problem to be solved.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the first functional decomposition applications chosen by the
author and Dr. Gernot Mueller<sup>(14)</sup> involves problems posed by the periodic table
of the elements - discovered by Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeleev in 1869. Mendeleev
discovered that the physical and chemical properties of the elements are a periodic
function of their proton number. A major success of Mendeleev&#146;s discovery was its
ability to predict chemical and physical properties of undiscovered and unknown elements
that were only later confirmed experimentally. Since Mendeleev&#146;s time, however,
several basic questions about this periodicity of properties have remained unanswered.
These questions are:</p>

</p><ol>
  <i><b>
  <li>Why</b></i> are the properties of the elements periodic?</li>
  <i><b>
  <li>Why</b></i> is the periodicity as observed in the periodic table of the elements not
    consistent (i.e., why do some rows have far more elements in them than other rows?</li>
  <li>Is there a <i><b>physical law</b></i> that satisfactorily describes all this periodic
    behavior?</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ever since Mendeleev&#146;s discovery, these basic questions have had
no satisfactory answers. Nevertheless, the answers to all three questions stated above can
be explained by the &quot;Universal Law of Decomposition of Functions,&quot; as discussed
above. The &quot;function&quot; involved in moving from one element to the next element in
the periodic table is simply &quot;the addition of another electron to the outer energy
level of the atom.&quot; It is this function that results in a new element with
significantly different properties and behaviors that those of its predecessor element.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mendeleev&#146;s problem - and a problem for all of his successors -
began when the number of elements between &quot;periods of repetition of simliar
behavior&quot; began to increase, over the initial eight elements (i.e., more elements
needed to be &quot;squeezed into&quot; each row in the periodic table). Some of these
elements - like the so-called &quot;rare earths&quot; - consist of groups of elements that
appeared to differ only slightly from each other in their properties and behaviors, and
also are very difficult to physically separate. Why are they so &quot;close&quot; in
properties and behavior, and why are there so many of them filling the same
&quot;period&quot;/row?</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The answer to these questions that have been plaguing scientists for
years lies in the idea of decomposition of a Triad. Instead of there being &quot;one&quot;
element, as expected, in a particular position in the periodic table, that element has
been replaced by elements that represent the decomposition of the element/function in
question, into groups of seven sub-functions/elements.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another application of functional decomposition lies in the medical
field. BioFutures, Inc., a think-tank company in the medical devices field, has applied
functional decomposition in order to predict next-generation drug molecules. That
company&#146;s discovery promises to revolutionize the research and development process
that pharmaceutical companies seeking new wonder drugs currently employ. BioFuture&#146;s
discovery<sup>(15)</sup> began with the application of Triads to problems in the medical
devices and pharmaceutical industries.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The author recognizes that the concepts of Triads and Triad
decomposition are difficult to &quot;digest&quot; and to understand, upon hearing them for
the first time. The same is true when an audience hears about some of the techniques of
TRIZ for the first time. Nevertheless, it is the author&#146;s opinion that these new
concepts needed to be exposed, at least in an introductory way, to this audience. The
author invites those who are interested in corresponding with him further about these
concepts, to do so. In the author&#146;s opinion, these concepts represent the leading
edge of research on next-generation problem-solving approaches.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Personal Development of Higher-Level Creativity</b></u> Next-generation
creativity systems will address the challenge of personally developing a higher CQ
(creativity quotient), through the application of certain exercises (as discussed above)
and practices. Such systems depend upon a clearer understanding of human functions. This
creativity development process begins with a study of the human being as a technical
system - focusing on human functions that are related to the goal of increasing personal
creative powers. Human functions were discussed in a recent article<sup>(18,22)</sup>.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The author has verified that this goal - raising the &quot;level&quot;,
and not just the capacity, of personal creativity - is achievable by considering two
general processes that occur in human beings, from a &quot;systems&quot; point of view.
All systems consume fuel to generate the energy required for certain operations. Some of
this energy contributes to &quot;useful products,&quot; - this is the first process. Some
of the energy contributes to &quot;harmful or unwanted products&quot; - this is the second
process, which represents &quot;losses of energy.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first process leads to increasing one&#146;s creative output. There
are exercises and practices for achieving this; these exercises and practices involve the
controlled application of intentionality.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second process is the process of preventing energy losses that
would otherwise be available for human creativity (several types of energy losses were
discussed above in the sections on psychological inertia - ordinary imagination and
identification). For each of these creativity barriers/losses, there are one or more
exercises that can be practiced to reduce the loss of creative energy. These exercises
also involve the application of intentionality.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Barriers to personal creativity have to be &quot;crushed&quot; or
eliminated. This &quot;crushing&quot; process is not dissimilar to the experience of
&quot;tasting&quot; various foods. The author recently read a quotation by D. Stam about
the herb called &quot;thyme&quot;: &quot;Only when thyme is crushed does it yield its
beautiful perfume.&quot; This metaphor holds true for barriers to creativity.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interested readers can already verify something about their own
creative capabilities, by carefully and honestly answering the following questions:
&quot;Is my creative capability constant, or does it vary with time (i.e., during the
24-hour day, during the week, etc.)?&quot; &quot;If my personal creative capability does
indeed vary between some minimum and some maximum - yielding a certain &quot;average&quot;
level of creative capability - is it possible to move this average in the direction of my
personal maximum creativity?&quot; &quot;Under what circumstances is my creative
capability very low?&quot; &quot;Under what personal circumstances is my creative
capability higher?&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is one category of exercises that readers who are seriously
interested in raising their personal creativity &quot;level&quot; can practice. This
category of word exercises has several purposes:</p>

</p><ol>
  </p><ol>
    <li>It gives the practitioner practice at being &quot;out of pattern.&quot;</li>
    <li>It requires that the practitioner increase his/her general level of attention.</li>
    <li>It acts as a &quot;source-generator&quot; of creative energy.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such exercises are quite simple to describe, but difficult in practice.
The instructions to the author&#146;s students (in the TRIZ Certification Program) include
(A) not mentioning any of the exercises to anyone not in the program, (B) attempting the
exercises in such a way that no one else will notice them (i.e., the exercises will not
appear out of the ordinary, or unusual, to any other party), and (C) kindly reminding
others in the program, when they say the &quot;veboten&quot; word, that they in fact have
spoken it. A typical example of one such exercise for the reader to practice:</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">For one entire month, avoid ever using a specific word: &quot;the&quot;</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mastering such exercises ultimately raises the levels at which a person
functions. The author invites feedback from anyone who takes on this simple trial
exercise, with the goal of increasing his/her personal creativity. Not all of the
exercises in the program are word exercises. Some exercises involve other human functions
than the human intellectual function - which is the slowest of the four basic functions<sup>(18,22)</sup>.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SUMMARY</b></u> Like other technical systems, TRIZ itself, as a
technical system, has also been evolving. Parts of the TRIZ approach have already been
replaced since its discovery in the late 1940&#146;s. It is likely that TRIZ will
ultimately merge with other systems, because it is at or near the top of its &quot;S-Curve
of Evolution.&quot; Next-Generation problem-solving systems will help problem-solvers to
achieve solutions more rapidly, will yield higher-level solutions, and will also be easier
to apply.</p>
