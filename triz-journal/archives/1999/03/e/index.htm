<h1>ARIZ on the Move</h1>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Introduction</b></p>

<p>The first of these articles are devoted to ARIZ (the Algorithm for Inventive Problem
Solving). We chose this subject for two reasons:

</p><ol>
  <li>It is clear that, after five years of excitement over the Contradiction Table and the 40
    Innovation Principles (both of which were developed in the mid-1960s), the interests of
    new and potential TRIZ users has shifted to more powerful tools like ARIZ. Actually, ARIZ
    is the opposite of the Contradiction Table in terms of complexity and effectiveness.
    Non-selective application of this extremely powerful though very complex and complicated
    tool can be very frustrating because ARIZ is cost-effective only for those problems which
    are truly unique. Usually, the solution to these problems cannot be drawn by analogy from
    other knowledge domains, but rather should be built from scratch the way a unique house is
    made from bricks according to a special design rather than from ready-to-assemble modules.
    According to Altshuller&#146;s research, less than 5% of the problems encountered in daily
    engineering activity are problems of this type. (It should be noted that attempting to
    apply the Contradiction Table to non-typical problem situations is no less frustrating due
    to its own limitations.)</li>
</ol>

<ol START="2">
  <li>Another reason is that the history of the development of ARIZ is a good illustration of
    the process developed by Altshuller for introducing new and advanced TRIZ tools. This
    process included a judicious and centralized initial presentation of the tool along with
    mandatory testing of its validity and applicability. Each modification to an existing tool
    or theory was first tested on educational case studies by Altshuller and the best TRIZ
    specialists, then utilized experimentally during TRIZ seminars, and finally tested on
    different real-life situations. This process was an effective way to prevent the damage
    that might otherwise have resulted from the irresponsible introduction of untested
    modifications. In the case of ARIZ it was a simple matter to recommend changes &#150; on
    the surface, ARIZ appears deceptively uncomplicated and merely rewording or changing the
    order of its steps can constitute significant revisions whose effectiveness can only be
    determined by rigorous testing. (In fact, modifications to ARIZ and other tools became the
    favorite pursuit of TRIZ novices.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Embarking, then, on this historical journey of rediscovery, the following two articles
published in the <i>Journal of TRIZ</i> in 1992 (Volume 3, Issue 1) are offered here:</p>

<p>The following article has been condensed from information presented at the seminar
&quot;Theory of Inventive Problem Solving&quot; held at the School of Management,
Simferopol, Ukraine, 1986</i><b></p>

<p>Why we need this session</b>

</p><ul>
  <li>ARIZ looks like a complicated subject. This session will demonstrate the logical way new
    ARIZ elements are introduced</li>
  <li>ARIZ is evolving quickly. It is important to understand the systematic way in which it
    has evolved</li>
  <li>ARIZ represents a mechanism of systemic thinking. Analyzing its evolution helps develop
    various algorithms for solving problems in non-technical areas (science, the arts, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>The notion that technological systems evolve according to certain patterns that can be
understood and purposefully used to solve problems emerged in 1946. Since 1948, the work
in this area has become vitally important.</p>

<p>Initially, the intention was to build a <i>method for inventing </i>as a set of rules
such as: &quot;Solving a problem means finding and resolving a technical
contradiction,&quot; or &quot;For any given solution, the less material, energy, space and
time used, the more powerful it is.&quot; This method was intended to include typical
innovation principles such as segmentation, integration, inversion, changing the aggregate
state, replacing a mechanical system with a chemical system, etc. These rules and
principles were to be (and are) based on research and information compiled about the
inventive activities of famous inventors, by interviewing known inventors, the analysis of
personal inventive practices, and other available technical information including the
history of technology.

<font SIZE="3"><b>

<p>ARIZ-56</b></p>

<p>ARIZ-56 is a set of steps for problem solving rather than an algorithm or program (in
the way that a Table of Contents is not yet a book). It was influenced by the practices of
the best inventors of the past; the analysis of patents was not yet a main tool for ARIZ
development. The operational part of ARIZ-56 recalls Synectics because of its reliance on
analogic thinking (primarily in its use of natural prototypes). <i>Journal:</i> <i>Questions
of Psychology, 1955, #6</i>.</p>

<p>Strengths of ARIZ-56

</p><ul>
  <li>It was precisely stated that solving a problem means revealing and resolving a technical
    contradiction</li>
  <li>It incorporated the concept of reaching beyond the boundaries of the immediate subject.</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of the practical implementation of ARIZ-56 is the solution of the problem of
developing a thermal protection suit.</p>

<p>In the mid-1950s, a strong understanding had grown that all inventors, even the most
successful ones, work extremely ineffectively. They used trial-and-error methods and it
was therefore senseless to attempt to uncover and put to use the &quot;secrets of
creativity.&quot; What did make sense was to build a completely new technology based on
the objective patterns of technological evolution, which could be revealed through a
systematic analysis of the extensive bulk of patent information.

<ol START="2">
  </font>
  <li>The synthesis of a program for problem-solving begins</li>
</ol>
<font SIZE="3"><b>

<p>ARIZ-59</b></p>

<p>ARIZ-59 represents the beginning of a long journey toward a structured algorithm
supported by a set of tools for sequential use (operators, knowledge base units, etc.).
The first steps, a chain of operations, appears. As of yet there is no system &#150; the
steps can be interchanged. &quot;Natural prototypes&quot; are moved to the end of the
operational portion of ARIZ. A new and important step is introduced: identification of the
Ultimate Final Result (Solution). <i>Journal:</i> <i>Inventor and Innovator, 1959, #10.</i>
</p>

<p>ARIZ-59 resulted from a number of seminars conducted in the construction industry of
Azerbaijan. Examples of practical implementation: electro-thermal jack, spiral binding for
clamps (J. A. Ismailov), and a grape espalier without poles.</p>

<p>By the end of the 1950s it became obvious that a &quot;method of inventing&quot; must
include, besides ARIZ, the patterns of technological evolution and the constantly growing
knowledge base. In fact, what was originally intended, as a &quot;method of
inventing&quot; would be more appropriately termed a <i>science of invention</i>. There
was strong resistance &#150; those opposed to the notion of a science of invention had
become accustomed to the existence of a &quot;method of inventing.&quot; After all, it
merely amounted to a set of useful recommendations based on analysis of the experience of
inventors. A science of invention, however, threatened more than a few &quot;sacred
cows.&quot; It denied the uniqueness of history&#146;s great inventors and intruded upon
the common perception of the incomprehensible nature of the creative process. While
&quot;method of inventing&quot; helped in terms of gaining insight to inventive thinking,
a &quot;science of invention&quot; in effect cancelled the old notions, including that of
creativity as an innate capability. This, in other words, was nothing less than pure
heresy . . . </p>
<b>

<p>ARIZ-61</b></p>

<p>ARIZ-61 was an improved version of ARIZ-59, based on a set of seminars conducted in
cities other than Baku in Donetsk, Tambov, Ryazan. The operational part of ARIZ-61 is
extended but the rules for fulfilling the recommendations of each step are still missing,
as well as the special steps later incorporated for controlling psychological inertia. <i>(H.
Altshuller, &quot;How to learn how to invent&quot;. Tambov Book Publishing House, 1961)</i>.</p>

<p>Examples of practical implementation are problems related to a mine pile (Donetsk) and
the sequential transport of oil products (Stavropol).

<ol START="3">
  </font>
  <li>Clarification of the program</li>
</ol>
<font SIZE="3"><b>

<p>ARIZ-64</b></p>

<p>ARIZ-64 introduces the section on &quot;Clarifying and verifying the problem
statement.&quot;<b> </b>This is a significant change and one that indicates a new
direction in ARIZ development &#150; as that of a tool for obtaining <i>powerful </i>solutions
to <i>difficult </i>problems. The rules for fulfilling the recommendations have been
introduced (step 2.1). The first table of Innovation Principles has been developed. <i>(H.
Altshuller. &quot;Basics of the Method of Inventing,&quot; Voroneg, Central Chernosem
Publishing House, 1964).</i></p>

<p>Example of practical implementation: Washing windows in a manufacturing plant.</p>
<b>

<p>ARIZ-65</b></p>

<p>In ARIZ-65 the first limited contradiction table is introduced. The operational portion
still contains the analysis of natural prototypes. The word &quot;algorithm&quot; has been
introduced as an indication of the long-term objective for the development of ARIZ. <i>(H.
Altshuller. &quot;Attention, an Algorithm of Invention.&quot; economics newspaper,
September 1, 1965).</i> </p>

<p>A pattern:</p>

<p>If certain steps in the evolution of TRIZ are identified as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I,
J, K, etc. and currently TRIZ is, for example, on step E, TRIZ allows us to see steps F,
G, and H, for example. In contrast, the opponents have so far accepted steps A, B, and C.
They are doubtful but silent about steps D and E, and are aggressively arguing against F
and G. Then TRIZ moves to step F, after which the opponents accept step D, do not want to
talk about E and F, and argue against G, which (to others) is utterly obvious as the step
that follows F, and so on . . .</p>

<p>When we spoke of a &quot;method of inventing,&quot; rivals were insistent that we refer
to nothing more than a collection of useful recommendations, considering an algorithmic
approach absolutely out of the question. When TRIZ emerged, they accepted the notion of an
&quot;algorithm&quot; and transferred their resistance and aversion to TRIZ, TRTS (Theory
of Evolution of Technological Systems) and OTSM (General Theory of Powerful Thinking) . .
.</p>
<b>

<p>ARIZ-68</b></p>

<p>The first chapter of ARIZ-68 is divided into two parts: Selection of the problem and
clarification of the problem statement. Special steps for handling psychological inertia
are introduced. The knowledge base is significantly extended and structured: systematic
analysis of patents has revealed 35 Innovation Principles and the next version of the
Contradiction Table. Paleo-bionics has been introduced instead of natural prototypes. <i>(H.
Altshuller. &quot;Algorithm of Invention,&quot; 1st edition, Moscow Worker, 1969).</i></p>

<p>Example of practical implementation: Icebreaker problem.</p>

<p>Until 1968, enhancements to ARIZ were based on the analysis of patent information.
Seminars were conducted from time to time; I was the only individual teaching TRIZ. After
1968 the situation was different. In anticipation of the mass utilization of TRIZ, the
preparation of teachers and modification of ARIZ for a general audience became necessary.</p>

<p>During the next three years &#150; from 1968 to 1971 &#150; TRIZ seminars were
organized in the following cities (all within the former Soviet Union): Sverdlovsk,
Kaunas, Moscow, Dzintary, Dushanbe, Baku, and Gomel. A comprehensive course in TRIZ was
completed in the inventive schools for youth in Baku. Selected portions of ARIZ were
tested via surveys. Altogether, more than 5,000 records related to 150 problems were
available and provided for the transition to the next version: ARIZ-71.

<ol START="4">
  </font>
  <li>The program becomes one of the algorithmic type</li>
</ol>
<font SIZE="3"><b>

<p>ARIZ-71</b></p>

<p>With ARIZ-71 the program becomes more rigorous. In the process of analysis, the
operational zone and its contradictory requirements have been identified (a prototype to
the later physical contradiction). A psychological operator for modifying Dimensions, Time
and Cost (DMC) has been introduced. The Contradiction Table has been brought to completion
and additional Innovation Principles have been identified (up to 40 and, later, to 50). <i>(H.
Altshuller. &quot;Algorithm of Invention,&quot; 2nd edition, Moscow Worker, 1973).</i></p>

<p>Recommendations, notes and examples of use have been added. The main operations are
integrated into a system and the links between steps are more rigid. A new section for
evaluating ideas that have been found has been introduced.</p>
<b>

<p>ARIZ-75</b></p>

<p>On one hand, ARIZ-75 is a logical continuation of ARIZ-71: more precise recommendations
for each of the steps and stricter requirements for completing them. Continued analysis
has revealed the existence of physical contradictions. </p>

<p>On the other hand, ARIZ-75 is the first modification built like TRIZ and is intended to
work together with the Patterns of Technological Evolution, substance-field
transformations and the compiled guides of effects. <i>H. Altshuller. &quot;Analysis of
Invention Case Studies.&quot; Collection of articles entitled &quot;The Theory and
Practice of Inventive Problem Solving&quot;. Gorkiy, 1976.</i></p>
<b>

<p>ARIZ-77</b></p>

<p>ARIZ-77 is a logical completion of the line that began with ARIZ-71: an algorithmic
type of program has been constructed. Again the rigorousness of the program is
significantly improved. The text includes multiple rules, notes and examples. A prototype
of the physical contradiction on a micro-level (Micro-PhC) is introduced (Step 4.1).
Analysis of the solution process has been included as well. Bridging of the steps and the
knowledge base (substance-field transformations and effects) has begun. The Contradiction
Table remains as an auxiliary unit. <i>(H. Altshuller. &quot;Creativity as an Exact
Science.&quot; Soviet Radio, Moscow, 1979.)</i>.</p>

<p>The 1970s represent a stormy time in the evolution of TRIZ. Dozens of TRIZ schools,
courses, seminars, etc. are teaching TRIZ, various mistakes and information helpful for
fixing them are quickly being revealed. All TRIZ subjects are in existence: the algorithm,
standard solutions, substance-field analysis, knowledge about the Patterns of
Technological Evolution and innovation guides. Methods of teaching TRIZ improve. </p>

<p>On the cusp between the 1970s and 1980s, new information necessary to provide for the
next step from TRIZ to TRTS (Theory of the Evolution of Technological Systems) started to
accumulate within TRIZ. After 1982 educational programs change, with the main objective is
preparation to teach TRTS and, further, to teach OTSM (General Theory of Powerful
Thinking), that is, to the theory of solving problems in any area.</p>

<p>Beginning with ARIZ-82, a paradoxical process of specialization/generalization begins.
In technology, ARIZ is targeted specifically toward the solving of difficult non-typical
problems and the development of new standard solutions. At the same time, ARIZ gains some
universal features as it is applied toward the solving of scientific problems, problems in
the arts, etc.</p>
<b>

<p>ARIZ-82 (modifications A, B, C and D) and ARIZ-85A</b></p>

<p>Information on educational and practical applications of the algorithm quickly
accumulates. Other TRIZ tools and applications improve as well, contributing toward the
further enhancement of ARIZ.</p>

<p>A new trend is in action: all recommendations and notes made by a teacher must be
incorporated into the algorithm. All chapters of ARIZ (with the exception of the first)
are improved, especially the operators having to do with transitioning from a physical
contradiction to methods for eliminating it. A unit for analyzing the problem model has
been introduced. A definition of &quot;micro-physical contradictions&quot; and the second
(refined) Ideal Ultimate Result (IUR-2) have been introduced as well. <i>(For ARIZ-82 see
&quot;Technology and Science,&quot; 1983, #2-4, 6. For ARIZ-85A see H. Altshuller, B.
Zlotin, V. Philatov. &quot;Profession &#150; the Search for New Ideas.&quot; Kartya
Moldovenyaska Publishing House, Kishinev, 1985).</i></p>
<b>

<p>ARIZ-85B and C</b></p>

<p>Significant changes in structure are introduced, including the second line of
operations and the analysis of substance-field resources. The former first chapter is no
longer part of the algorithm as it is not rigorous enough compared to the other chapters.
The orientation towards ideality strongly increases as a void (empty space) is recognized
as the most effective resource. </p>

<p>The link between the algorithm, the system of standard solutions, and the patterns of
technological evolution becomes stronger. The second half of the algorithm &#150; that
devoted to the development and utilization of ideas that have been found &#150; is
improved as well. <i>(H. Altshuller. &quot;ARIZ-85B and ARIZ-85C.&quot; Dnepropetrovsk,

<p>What will the next steps be in the development of ARIZ?</p>

<p>The following main directions can be highlighted:

</p><ol>
  <li>The tradition of increased rigorousness in the evolution of ARIZ continues due to more
    thorough and increased utilization of the Patterns of Technological Evolution.</li>
  <li>Significant strengthening of the bridge between physical contradictions and the methods
    for resolving them.</li>
  <li>Extension of the knowledge base and strengthening of the bridge between ARIZ and the
    standard solutions.</li>
  <li>Separation of the second portion of ARIZ (the development and utilization of ideas) into
    a separate algorithm</li>
  <li>Development of a new first chapter (or a separate algorithm) for revealing new problems
    to be solved.</li>
  <li>Strengthening of the philosophical function of ARIZ as a tool for developing the skills
    for powerful thinking.</li>
  <li>Continual increase of universalization (i.e., encompassing more types of problems other
    than technical).</li>

<p><b>History</b></p>

<p>Back in 1985, after a set of experimental versions had been developed, a definitive
version of ARIZ (ARIZ-85C) was introduced. With this, along with the guidance of
experienced TRIZ teachers, the attendees of TRIZ seminars became quite successful in
handling special training case studies (i.e., problems with well-defined statements).
Still, students learning ARIZ had to overcome many difficulties, so further explanations,
comments and illustrations were needed. Some of the steps in ARIZ required a significant
number of exercises. The most serious problems took place, however, when students were
trying to solve real life (and thus poorly formulated) problems, due to the absence of a
&quot;problem clarification and formulation&quot; steps in ARIZ-85C. This section existed
in previous modifications of ARIZ (ARIZ-71, 77), but was excluded in later versions due to
the lack of improvement it had undergone compared to other, more rigorous and
quickly-evolving sections of ARIZ.</p>

<p>TRIZ educators from various schools were looking for the ways to overcome the
difficulties mentioned above. Some educators accumulated fairly extensive lists of
recommendations related to further ARIZ enhancements, including attempts to develop new
versions of ARIZ. By 1989, several TRIZ individuals and groups presented and tested their
own versions, for example, V. Korolev (Belaya Tserkov), Y. Andrievskiy (Petrozavodsk), a
group from Novosibirsk, and others. This could be considered a dangerous situation,
because it could set the stage for students getting low-quality educational materials
and/or cause TRIZ schools to lose a common educational platform.</p>

<p>Two &#145;paths&#146; toward the enhancement of ARIZ could be considered. One was
arranged by Henry Altshuller, the sole author of all versions of ARIZ &#150; versions
which had been successfully used over several decades. All recommendations and suggestions
for improvements to ARIZ were sent to Altshuller, who would decide to incorporate them, if
necessary, into the next version of ARIZ recommended for use in TRIZ schools. This time,
however, Altshuller ignored the requests of TRIZ educators for a new version. He was
convinced that ARIZ-85C was good enough. He also explained that he preferred, for the
present time, to direct his efforts in the area of the Theory of Development of a Strong
Creative Personality (TRTL) rather than involving himself with ARIZ. </p>

<p>Another of these &#145;paths&#146; included organizing a group of TRIZ developers to
collect all the recommendations, develop the next version of ARIZ, and submit it to
Altshuller and other TRIZ specialists for discussion and approval. This approach presented
a problem as well: ARIZ was Altshuller&#146;s intellectual property and it was therefore
impossible (or rather, unethical) to work with it. This problem was eventually eliminated,
however. During the first meeting of the Board of the TRIZ Association in October 1989,
Altshuller granted formal permission for work to be done on ARIZ.</p>

<p>During the 1989 TRIZ Conference in Petrozavosk, a roundtable discussion was devoted to
the enhancement of ARIZ. The following TRIZ specialists participated, under the leadership
of S. Litvin: K. Sklobovsky (Obninsk), M. Sharapov (Magnitogorsk), M. Bdulenko
(Krasnogorsk), S. Sychev (Rostov-on-Don), V. Kaner, A. Pinyaev, E. Zlotin, V. Kryachko, V.
Petrov, V .Dubrov, A. Lubomorskiy, (all- St. Petersburg); G. Frenklakh (Gomel), V.
Ladoshkin, A. Torgashev (Novosibirsk); E. Martinova, S. Pernitskiy (Zukovskiy), G.
Pigorov, Y. Stupniker (Dnepropetrovsk); N. Khomenko (Minsk); I. Goihman (Mitishci); A.
Zusman, B. Zlotin, Z. Royzen (Kishinev); V. Korolev (Belaya Tserkov), Y. Andrievskiy
(Petrozavodsk), E. Kagan (Volgograd), and others. Litvin offered the most comprehensive
list of suggestions for improvement; many suggestions were presented by E. Zlotin, V.
Petrov, and TRIZ educators from Kishinev and other schools.</p>

<p>Immediately following the conference, Litvin, Zusman, B. Zlotin, E. Zlotin and Petrov
met in St. Petersburg to discuss the results of the roundtable discussion. The result was
a decision to begin to work jointly on the new version of ARIZ, with the following
objectives in mind:

</p><ol>
  <li>Increase reliability and provide a higher probability of success using ARIZ to solve
    real-life problems.</li>
  <li>Improve teaching methods to provide high-quality education within a reasonable time,
    taking into consideration an increasing demand.</li>
  <li>Implement the new developments and suggestions made over the last five years.</li>
  <li>Prepare ARIZ for effective computerization.</li>
</ol>

<p>It was noted that the above objectives could be achieved by improving the rigorousness
of ARIZ and incorporating additional steps and rules (micro-algorithms).</p>
</font><b>

<p>Basic considerations for improvement</b><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p>During the five years that ARIZ-85C had been taught, TRIZ educators &#150; including
those from Kishinev &#150; had gained sufficient experience in its use. The most typical
difficulties and mistakes made by students had been documented, and some of them are
described below. </p>
<i><b>

<p>&nbsp;</b></i></p>

<p><i><b>Identifying the &#145;mini-problem&#146;</b></i></p>

<p>Singling out the so-called mini-problem from the innovation situation does not usually
represent an obstacle when dealing with training case studies which have well-defined
conditions with no more than two hierarchical system levels. However, when more than two
levels exist (which is the case in practical situations) it is much more difficult. The
recommendation placed in Note 1 to Step 1.1 (ARIZ-85C), and which reads as follows:
&quot;Everything remains the same or becomes simplified, while a desired action or feature
is provided (or an undesired action or feature is eliminated)&quot; sounds too vague. It
is not clear which undesired effect to choose &#150; in practical situations there are
usually several of them with complex interconnections &#150; or which desired improvement
to focus on (see Exhibit 1 for details).</p>

<p>Moreover, practical experience in solving problems stated by an individual with no TRIZ
education had shown that the stated problem statement was incorrect nearly all the time,
since it had been stated &quot;casually.&quot;<b> </b>This contributed toward making the
solution process extremely difficult. To transition from such a problem statement to a <i>correctly
defined mini-problem</i> in one shot was a challenge even to experience TRIZ specialists.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i><b></p>

<p>Formulating the mini-problem</b></i></p>

<p>Nearly every novice encounters the situation where the problem statement does not
clearly indicate a technical contradiction. Special recommendations (Note 3 to Step 1.1)
are introduced to help formulate an artificial contradiction, however, additional
explanations from the trainer are required. Moreover, although an artificial contradiction
allows processing of the problem in ARIZ to formally begin, it does not provide an
opportunity to apply typical recommendations for eliminating technical contradictions,
because it does not reflect the real situation. </p>

<p>Another difficulty is caused by the absence of a strict form for the TC by way of a
logical clause: </p>

<p>IF [condition] THEN [some positive statement], BUT ALSO [some negative statement].</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that students in our traditional schools (editor&#146;s note: non-TRIZ
schools)<b> </b>had never heard of such a subject as Logic, they often formulate the
technical contradiction following the pattern: &quot;My wife is not pretty, but she is a
poor wife.&quot; Confusion is even greater because the technical contradiction may be
expressed in terms of parameters (e.g., &quot;While productivity increases, quality
deteriorates&quot;) or in terms of actions or functions as well (such as &quot;The
solution, when heated, degrades.&quot; Actually, both types of technical contradiction are
valuable (the parameter for the technical contradiction helps the user to enter the
Contradiction Table, while the functional technical contradiction helps unveil the
interactions and processes taking place in the system). A lack of accuracy in the
definitions, however, negatively impacts the rigorousness of ARIZ. </p>

<p>&nbsp;<i><b></p>

<p>Identifying conflict elements and conflict type</b></i></p>

<p>The main problem here is with the selection of a tool and article when there are more
than two elements mentioned in the problem description. Also, the situation does not
become any easier when the same elements play opposite roles of a tool or article related
to a positive action versus a negative one (e.g., a mill (tool) machines (positive action)
a metal part (article) but the metal part (tool) wears (negative action) the mill
(article)).. Typical mistakes made in Step 1.3 are to indicate properties or parameters as
conflict elements instead of actual parts; forgetting to indicate two conditions of the
tool. The reason for this is the same as that mentioned above &#150; that is, the absence
of a procedure for separating the mini-problem from the innovation situation. Too many
elements result from several problems each having their own elements simultaneously
analyzed. Situations such as these have a special name in TRIZ &#150; <i>putanka </i>(entangled)
&#150; and there was a recommendation to separate problems in this situation, although
there was no explanation as to how to accomplish this. ARIZ-85C provides that multi-link
conflicts be built and that they be convoluted. All in all, the procedure is too vague.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i><b></p>

<p>Choosing the Main Manufacturing Process (MMP)</b></i></p>

<p>Step 1.4 recommends choosing as the MMP one, which provides the best performance for
the main useful function of the system. However, Note 13 points on an exception related to
problems of measurement and/or control. In the latter situation, it is recommended to
choose the function of the system as a whole rather than the function of its measurement
sub-system. At the same time, a similar situation may occur when there is a protecting
sub-system. For example, in the problem with the lightning rod and antenna it is
recommended to choose the reception function of the antenna as an MMP rather than the
function of protecting the antenna from lightning. To summarize the situation, it is
possible to offer a more general recommendation indicating that in both cases we are
dealing with auxiliary functions. In general, auxiliary functions include correcting ones,
that is, actions to correct some negative consequences in the system&#146;s functionality
such as chiseling out the remaining slag from a ladle. But identifying whether a function
is main or auxiliary is a relative matter and depends entirely on the number of
hierarchical system levels taken into consideration, as well as the choice of separating a
problem to be solved from the innovation situation. If this level has not been identified,
mistakes are possible. </p>

<p>A question: why do we need to choose the MMP, and thus a technical contradiction, at
all? Of course, when we formulate two technical contradictions (let&#146;s call them TC1
and TC2) we get two completely different problems. ARIZ recommends that the most promising
one be selected, but how do we know which is the most promising? A. Lubomirskiy once
indicated that, as a rule, one TC is connected with an existing system and selecting this
one means working in the direction of improving the system, while selecting the opposite
TC usually means focusing on searching for an alternative way of getting the desired
result (i.e., developing a new system). Because it is difficult to estimate ahead of time
which direction might result in a better solution, it makes sense to abandon the selection
altogether, especially since there is a precedent in ARIZ-85C for a parallel analysis of
resources (Step 3.2). Taking the above into consideration, we recommend working with both
technical contradictions in parallel up until Step 3.3 (formulation of the Physical
Contradiction) when it is no longer important which conflict has been chosen. </p>

<p>In our opinion, the absence of the problem statement formulation chapter was the reason
new steps should be introduced, forcing the user to work with main functions such as
choosing the conflict, convolution of multi-link conflicts, and several others.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i><b></p>

<p>Other issues</b></i></p>

<p>A large number of mistakes are associated with the lack of micro-algorithms for helping
to formulate steps. However, micro-algorithms cause a &#145;swelling&#146; of the tool,
which is already very complex, overloaded with rules, notes, examples, etc. It is
necessary to restructure ARIZ to allow its enhancement to remain transparent and to
provide for the main line of analysis being easily understood.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i><b></p>

<p>New requirements for ARIZ</b></i></p>

<p>Besides the issue of problem statement formulation, another impeding factor in the
existing ARIZ is the focus on a single solution that is close to the Ideal Ultimate
Result. In real life, however, it is practical to have options. Such an option would
perhaps be to choose solutions which are less ideal but which are, for some reason
(technical, organizational, legal, personal, etc.), easier to implement &#150; solutions
which, in other words, have a higher local ideality (see Exhibit 2).</p>

<p>The focus on obtaining an &#145;array&#146; of solutions dictates changing the approach
to ARIZ regarding the integration of the analytical and solution-generating steps. It has
always been perceived that the line of analysis should not be interrupted. This is why
solution-generating tools such as the Principles or the Standard Solutions are always
addressed after completing a certain portion of the analysis. At the same time, it is
known that each step brings certain changes to our understanding of the problem, and
toward its reformulation. In addition, if one takes into consideration that the main way
to solve a problem is by using some type of analogy, each step may change the problem such
that it becomes similar to one available in the knowledge base &#150; that is, the
solution may be obtained at any step. Moreover, we know from experience that attempts to
find a solution at each step provide a super-effect, i.e., they lead to a much better
understanding of the problem. Keeping in mind the need to obtain an array of solutions, it
is worthwhile to apply solution-generating tools after each appropriate step. Again, we
have an example of this approach in existing ARIZ-85C, when the Standard Solutions are
used in three places. All we need is to expand this practice. ARIZ-85C does not make use
of the Innovation Principles for eliminating technical contradictions, in spite of the
fact that we formulate technical contradictions and therefore the possibility exists for
applying the Principles. At one point in time, the Principles were removed from ARIZ in
anticipation that the Standard Solutions would be much more effective. However, practical
experience has proven that these two tools were complementary. </p>

<p>In 1985, V. Kryachko (St. Petersburg) noted that when we formulate two technical
contradictions (Step 1.1), we automatically obtain all the components necessary to
formulate the initial <i>physical contradictions </i>for the tool&#146;s contradictory
states or other conditions (many lightning rods versus a few; a high-speed gas stream
versus a low-speed gas stream, etc.). This means that an opportunity exists for applying
the Separation Principles right away. The solutions that can be obtained at this stage are
not necessarily the same as those obtained in Step 5.3 &#150; in Step 3.3 the physical
contradiction is formulated for a selected resource which usually differs from the
tool&#146;s conditions. As a result, formulation and resolving of the initial physical
contradiction may contribute toward obtaining multiple solutions.</p>

<p>Special requirements apply to ARIZ as a &#145;base&#146; for computerization. First,
micro-algorithms are necessary, as steps must be accurate and detailed enough so that the
next step can be logically drawn from the previous one in only one way. In the case when a
user must add specific information to the next step, this information should be available
in the form of various menus, i.e., lists of typical drawbacks (physical or others),
macro- and/or micro- conditions, etc. Typical formulations (templates) are also necessary
to allow the user to introduce specific information related to the problem under
consideration according to an organized scheme. Further, it is necessary to provide users,
which don&#146;t have a comprehensive TRIZ education with the opportunity to begin working
with ARIZ using his/her &quot;natural&quot; engineering language. These users should be
able to transition to typical problem statements from various original problem statements
(that is, to &#145;pull&#146; typical statements in the same way one pulls the whole chain
by picking just one link).</p>

<p>In summary, the following changes should be introduced into ARIZ:

</p><ol>
  <li>Introduce sections related to the problem formulation process, including one which will
    facilitate an attempt to solve the problem as it is stated in the original problem
    statement, and then another, which will help restore the complete innovation situation and
    provide for the selection of a new (and more promising) problem statement.</li>
  <li>Provide the possibility for applying the solution-generating tools as much as possible
    during the work with ARIZ.</li>
  <li>Develop various menus with typical problem statements.</li>
  <li>Make ARIZ convenient to use &#150; i.e., structured, with separation between
    micro-algorithms, examples, and definitions in separate volumes. </li>
</ol>

<p>Continuing the story</b><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p>The principles and ideas mentioned above formed the basis for development of the first
experimental version of ARIZ-KE-89/90, which was tested during TRIZ seminars conducted by
the company <i>Progress</i> (five groups of courses, each consisting of 200 hours). The
second experimental version implemented the results obtained from testing the previous one
and additional materials provided by Litvin. Recommendations from V. Dubrov and A. Pinyaev
were taken into consideration (in part) as well. The Kishinev TRIZ school presented the
new version of ARIZ at the meeting organized by the NILIM theoretical department (St.
Petersburg, department head: S. Litvin) in January, 1991. TRIZ specialists V. Korolev, A.
Torgashev, A. Kuryanov, A. Lubomirskiy, A. Pinyaev, V. Gerasimov, V. Dubrov, and A. Zusman
participated as well. As subjects for discussion, other materials were presented, as

<p>ARIZ &#150; SMVA 91 (E) version<i></p>

<p>Structure</i></b></p>

<p>The structure of ARIZ-KE-89/90 was similar to that of ARIZ -85C. We succeeded in
maintaining the same number of sections, although a section for analyzing the innovation
situation was added. However, implementation of recommendations resulting from testing, as
well as those made by S. Litvin, have blown apart the old structure. Segmentation of steps
often required that some of them be converted into separate chapters to avoid multi-level
numeration, which could hinder understanding of the ARIZ process. Most importantly,
however, was that it had become obvious that, with such level of detail, ARIZ was more
suitable for execution by computer rather than manually. In other words, what was supposed
to become ARIZ-91 was converted into a platform for a &quot;machine&quot; version. Taking
into consideration that in spite of introducing new chapters, the main ideas and
procedures of ARIZ-85C remained, it became a platform for the machine version of ARIZ-85C.
For this reason, it was called ARIZ-SMV 91 (E) which meant Scenario (S) of Machine (M)
Version (V) based on ARIZ-85C, Experimental (E) version.</p>

<p>It is clear that conversion to a software scenario will take a substantial length of
time. Furthermore, even when it is complete, not everyone will have a computer. However,
we would be remiss to ignore the possibility of significantly enhancing ARIZ at the
present time. This is why we have decided to consider adapting the scenario for manual
use. To achieve this, the complexity of the algorithm had to be substantially reduced.
From the main text, definitions, rules, notes and micro-algorithms repeatedly used have
been removed. The resulting structure now represents ARIZ-SMVA 91 (E), where &quot;A&quot;

<p>&nbsp;<i><b></p>

<p>Analysis of the innovation situation</b></i></p>

<p>The first chapters of ARIZ-SMVA deal with analyzing an innovation situation &#150;
formulating the problem statement. Chapter 1 helps address the problem in its original
statement. A problem randomly picked up in the occasional problem statement is converted
into a typical problem statement, thus allowing the following main TRIZ tools to be
applied: the Contradiction Table and the Standard Solutions. To achieve this, the user
chooses an appropriate item from a list of typical drawbacks. Then, depending on the
situation (i.e., if known ways to eliminate a drawback are not available or they cannot be
utilized for some reason), ARIZ helps in choosing the typical problem statement as well as
an appropriate tool to deal with it (Principles, the specific group of Standard Solutions,
Value Engineering or Scientific Problem solving methodology, or Anticipatory Failure
Determination). Besides this, the user documents limitations with the help of the list of
typical limitations. Also documented are the expected economical, technical and other
effects (some of these steps existed in the version of 1977). In some cases, promising
ideas can be generated at that time, however, continued use of the tool is encouraged.</p>

<p>Chapter 2 includes a procedure for becoming acquainted with the system in which the
problem emerged, in detail: the main elements, their structure and functioning. The
purpose here is to prepare the background for Chapter 3 (restoration of the innovation
situation). However, after assessing additional information, a second attempt to solve the
problem as it appears in the original problem statement may be performed. Along with the
recommendation of S. Litvin, information about alternative systems to the one under
consideration is included. Whatever the results obtained at this stage, the analysis
should be continued.</p>

<p>The main purpose of Chapter 3 is to build cause-and-effect chains of useful and harmful
functions and effects, and a combined graphical &#145;tree&#146; based on these chains.
The cause-and-effect relationships can also be represented in a matrix format (A.
Pinyaev&#146;s recommendation), however, even a rather simple innovation situation may
have multiple branches and in our opinion the tree format provides much more visibility
than the matrix. The purpose of building a graphical tree is to reveal key nodes &#150;
places where the same factor or function provides useful results and at the same time is
the reason for the harmful one. It is quite obvious that it is better to eliminate a cause
rather than its consequences &#150; that is, to solve a key problem. However, there may be
many key problems in the situation.</p>

<p>Building chains of useful effects is similar to developing FAST diagrams
(&quot;Reference Book on Value Engineering&quot; by M. G. Karpunin and B. I. Maidanchik,
Moscow, Finances and Statistics, 1988). In fact, for each known function, two specific
questions are applied:

</p><ol>
  <li>What is the purpose of performing this function?</li>
  <li VALUE="2">What is necessary to perform this function?</li>
</ol>

<p>Answering the first question allows the chain to be continued to the right while the
second question helps continue the chain to the left. For harmful chains, two different
questions require answers:

</p><ol>
  <li>What is the result of this harmful factor (action)?</li>
  <li VALUE="2">What is the cause of this harmful factor (action)?</li>
</ol>

<p>Following these questions, two separate chains (useful and harmful) can be built. To
reveal key nodes, it is necessary to combine them, that is, to find the places they
connect. Actually, they connect in the following situations:

</p><ul>
  <li>A harmful effect is caused by a useful function</li>
  <li>A useful function is introduced to correct an existing harmful effect </li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, for each link from a useful or a harmful chain two additional questions
should be asked. For a link from a useful chain:

</p><ol>
  <li>Does this useful function cause a harmful function?</li>
  <li VALUE="2">Is this useful function introduced to correct a harmful factor?</li>
</ol>

<p>Accordingly, for a link from a harmful chain:

</p><ol>
  <li>Is this harmful factor caused by a useful function?</li>
  <li VALUE="2">Is any useful function introduced to correct this harmful factor?</li>
</ol>

<p>Answers to these questions help connect useful and harmful chains, and add new chains
that were not obvious from the beginning.</p>

<p>Once the tree is built, for every link a typical problem statement may be formulated as
follows:

</p><ul>
  <li>Correcting problem: Eliminate a harmful factor (action)</li>
  <li>Alternative problem: Find an alternative way to realize a useful function</li>
  <li>Refusing problem: Find a way to forgo the useful function</li>
  <li>Key correcting problem: Eliminate a harmful effect without giving up a connected useful
    function (this problem statement can be used as a basis for formulating the mini-problem)</li>
  <li>Key alternative problem: Find an alternative way to perform a useful function so the
    harmful factor disappears</li>
  <li>Key refusing problem: Find a way to forgo the useful function together with a connected
    harmful factor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once all adequate problem statements have been formulated they are placed in
hierarchical order, taking into consideration how drastic are the resulting possible
changes to the system. Having done this, the user can prioritize the list based on
recommended criteria and the specifics associated with that user.</p>

<p>If for any reason the first problem statement chosen is not a &quot;key
correcting&quot; problem, it is recommended that the user return to Chapter 1, select an
appropriate typical problem statement, and apply the recommended tools. If a key
correcting problem is selected, a transition to the next chapter can be made.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i><b></p>

<p>New features related to other chapters of ARIZ</b></i></p>

<p>Chapter 4 is devoted to the formulation of the mini-problem. The difficulties mentioned
above are overcome because all necessary elements are drawn from fairly rigorous
transformations of the key node, representing the key problem. These transformations are
made with the help of pre-formulated precise frames (templates) for useful and harmful
functions (actions), technical contradictions, and the mini-problem as a whole. For
example, the typical frame for a function looks like this: &quot;A tool [indicate the
tool] impacts [indicate how] an article [indicate the article].&quot; It forces the user
to identify a tool and article from the very beginning, and to do so separately for a
useful and a harmful function. These elements may be (partially or completely) the same
for both situations &#150; otherwise there would be no conflict. An unambiguous meaning of
the choice of conflict elements is determined by the prior choice of the key node. A
special operator to eliminate special terminology (Litvin&#146;s suggestion) and
micro-algorithms for building graphical conflict diagrams have been introduced.</p>

<p>Because we do not select a preferable conflict to continue analysis, its enforcement
(Chapter 6), a problem model (Chapter 7), and the application of Substance-Field
Transformations and Standard Solutions (Chapter 8) are made for both conflicts. Instead of
&quot;x-element&quot; we use the term &quot;x-resource,&quot; which enforces the focus on
IUR.</p>

<p>A distinguishing feature is that identification of the operational zone and/or the
operational time is now separate for useful and harmful functions. As a result, one can
estimate right away the possibility of separating the conflict in space or in time.
Resources unveiled during study of the operational zone are placed in a special table.
Besides substance- field resources, processes, substance flows, energy and information are
identified and separated into useful and harmful resources.</p>

<p>In ARIZ-SMVA 91 (E), a set of physical contradictions is formulated. First, the initial
physical contradiction mentioned above is formulated (Chapter 5, immediately after
technical contradictions have been identified). Then, physical contradictions for process,
macro- and micro- conditions, and flow have been identified (Chapter 11). To facilitate
formulation, special lists of typical macro- and micro- conditions, flows and processes
are offered. The analysis of physical contradictions begins from formulating an auxiliary
one for a parameter. (G.S. Altshuller and others. Search for new ideas: from insight to
methodology. Kishinev, Kartya Moldovenyaska, 1989, p. 36). A suggestion made by V. Dubrov
related to the same subject was taken into consideration as well. </p>

<p>IUR-1 (Chapter 10) is formulated for both technical contradictions. In this chapter,
the following steps must be made:

</p><ul>
  <li>An attempt to solve the problem in the IUR statement using the &quot;step back from the
    IUR&quot; approach</li>
  <li>Developing a &quot;portrait&quot; of an &quot;x-resource&quot; (Litvin&#146;s
    suggestion) and a search for a suitable resource from them ones unveiled in Chapter 9 and
    with the help of the Innovation Effects Guide</li>
  <li>An attempt to consider the possibility of achieving a compromise (Z. Royzen&#146;s
    suggestion)</li>
  <li>Identification of the &quot;main resource&quot; &#150; a candidate for solution to be
    developed from the Innovation Effects Guide</li>
</ul>

<p>IUR-2 is formulated for each physical contradiction (Litvin&#146;s suggestion). As a
result, a block of new physical problems is developed which it is recommended be solved
with the use of the Standard Solutions and/or the Innovation Effects Guide (Chapter 14).</p>

<p>Chapters 15 through 18 do not differ considerably from the corresponding chapters of
ARIZ-85C. (They will be elaborated ahead.)</p>

<p>Continuing the story</b><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p>As was mentioned above, the following three complete versions of ARIZ were presented at
the meeting held in St. Petersburg, together with the list of suggestions from S. Litvin:

</p><ul>
  <li>Version prepared by V. Korolev</li>
  <li>Novosibirsk version</li>
  <li>ARIZ &#150; SMVA- 91 (E) (Kishinev)</li>
</ul>

<p>The main discussions took place regarding the basic concept for the new version of
ARIZ, which could be submitted to the Board of the TRIZ Association for approval and
recommendation for use in all TRIZ schools. Ms. Zusman made a suggestion to use the
Kishinev version because ARIZ SMVA 91 (E):

</p><ol>
  <li>Is the only one that contains sections for the analysis of the innovation situation and
    problem formulation</li>
  <li>Incorporated the most complete set of recommendations from other TRIZ schools</li>
  <li>Has been tested in TRIZ seminars with satisfactory results: students were learning it
    with minimal help from the trainers and in less time (36 hours instead of 50). </li>
</ol>

<p>Other meeting participants did not accept this suggestion. Mostly, they didn&#146;t
like the fact that the ARIZ structure had changed considerably. Explanations that
structural changes were inevitable because numerous suggestions had been implemented did
not help. The following decision was made: to recommend that Mr. Litvin make an attempt to
develop another version which would incorporate useful suggestions within the existing
structure &#150; that is, that would again be without the formulation sections. The
Kishinev school was allowed to continue working in the direction chosen.</p>

<p>We &quot;followed&quot; this recommendation. ARIZ-SMVA 91(E) did a good job for another
four groups with good results, especially in solving practical problems. The number of
case studies doubled, detailed teaching plans were developed. New additions have been made
as well. Lastly, a new system of Standard Solutions adapted for use with the new version
of ARIZ is in development.</p>

<p></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What&#146;s next?</p>
<font SIZE="3">

<p>We are continuing our work on enhancing the analytical and solution-generating
components of ARIZ in the following directions:

</p><ol>
  <li>Consider the Administrative Contradiction introduced earlier by Mr. Altshuller and not
    used in ARIZ. An Administrative Contradiction is defined as a situation where performing
    an action is required but impossible due to some limitation or prohibition (such as a
    violation of natural laws, economic or social conditions, etc.). Depending upon the nature
    of the limitation and the particular details, appropriate principles similar to the
    Separation Principles can be applied.</li>
  <li>A new approach to resolving physical contradictions. Dealing with a set of physical
    contradictions has proven that the general Separation Principles can be specialized
    because some work better than others do with physical contradictions for flows, initial
    physical contradictions, etc. New tables for resolving different physical contradictions
    are in development.</li>
  <li>Development of a new system of Standard Solutions, partially incorporating the
    Innovation Principles and Patterns of Evolution. In particular, working with the modeling
    processes for dynamic substance-field structures in accordance with the Patterns. Another
    feature is the extension of resource nomenclature focusing on products resulting from the
    processes that take place in a technological system.</li>
  <li>Development of the closing chapters of ARIZ, in particular, procedures for enhancing the
    obtained solution concepts (this is of increasing importance given our integration into
    the worldwide economic system), which will possibly be separated in to a special
    algorithm. Introduction of a new chapter that allows one to reveal and prevent potential
    implementation problems ahead of time (based on subversion analysis).</li>
  <li>Development of a special educational section with typical recommendations for teachers,
    Q&amp;A, etc.</li>
  <li>Bringing ARIZ into a close relationship with applications other than those for problem
    solving, such as TRIZ forecasting, AFD and TRIZ Value Engineering.</li>
</ol>

<p>We asked our students not to disclose the version ARIZ-KE-89/90 they received
(including the one copy deposited in the Chelyabinsk Scientific Library), as it was an
experimental intermediate version with certain deficiencies (version 89KE doesn't exist
any more, later version ARIZ-91 (E2) or ARIZ-92 exists in Russian only. There is a version
of ARIZ-95 (ARIZ-92 without</p>

<p>formulation part as it was supposed to work together with the IWB software providing
automated formulation) which was translated (translation is pretty poor) and not edited.).
The SMVA version is complete (though still experimental) and, in general, is ready to be
used for self-learning. Expansion of the testing base will also be helpful. For those
reasons, we distributed 15 copies of this version between leading TRIZ schools and
specialists during the Second TRIZ Association Conference in Petrozavodsk. Since August,

<p>About Mini-problem</b><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p>It is well known that the parts of technological systems are firmly linked and that a
failure in one part (even a part of minimal importance) can cause the whole system to
fail. At the same time, this provides the opportunity to correct the situation by changing
other parts of the system rather than fixing the part that is causing the problem. As a
result, many problem statements can be formulated for a given innovation situation &#150;
and for this reason selection of the mini-problem is necessary. The selection criterion is
formulated in Note 1 of Step 1.1 (ARIZ-85C): &quot;Everything remains the same or becomes
simplified, while the required action or property emerges or the undesired action or
property disappears.&quot; The main reasons for addressing the mini-problem are the
following:

<ol type="a">
  <li>There is usually only one mini-problem so it easier to &quot;separate&quot; it from the
    innovation situation</li>
  <li>Formulating a mini-problem means focusing on achieving the desired results with minimal
    changes &#150; that is, achieving higher ideality.</li>
  <li>Minimal changes to the system generally make the process of implementing the solution
    easier.</li>
</ol>

<p>The main difficulty is that this formula can produce more than one mini-problem. In his
notes to ARIZ-77, Altshuller wrote: &quot;The mini-problem can be obtained from an
innovation situation following the principle: the existing situation minus the drawback or
plus a desired advantage (new quality).&quot; (H. Altshuller. &quot;Creativity as an Exact
Science.&quot; Soviet Radio, Moscow, 1979, p.44). However, even in this format there may
be several problem statements because it is not clear at which level of the system
hierarchy we should &quot;freeze&quot; changes. For example, in the situation with
transporting slag, the following problem statements can exist:

</p><ul>
  <li>The problem of the high cost of removing the hardened slag from the ladle; in this case
    we should improve the slag removal system and leave slag transport system as it is</li>
  <li>The problem of reducing waste while keeping the existing system of slag removal</li>
  <li>The problem of reducing wasted time (it is necessary to wait to remove the slag while
    the hot ladle is cooling), etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>In ARIZ-82 an extended formula for the mini-problem has been introduced with the added
clause &quot;or simplifies.&quot; This allows for the selection of a mini-problem at any
level of the system hierarchy. So then, which level in particular? Obviously, the level at
which the required changes are minimal. But is it possible to identify this level at the
onset?</p>

<p>It is also well known that a high level of ideality can be achieved by utilization of
the resources available in the system for resolving contradictions. Obviously, each level
has its own resources and contains unique possibilities for using them (see Exhibit 2 for
more on this). Is it possible to evaluate the resources before the problem statement is
selected? In general, the answer is yes, however, it means substituting analysis with the
random exploration of resources, and this is not that far from the usual method of
trial-and-error.</p>

<p>Given the above, we conclude that the criteria imbedded in the formula of a
mini-problem do not allow only one to be unambiguously defined. Moreover, it can be shown
that the following two criteria: &quot;Everything remains the same&quot; and
&quot;everything becomes simplified&quot; can lead one in opposite directions. For
example, imagine that we have a minimal standard innovation situation with two system
levels: a system with a drawback D1 where an attempt to remove this drawback causes
another drawback, D2. If we want to &quot;keep everything as it is&quot; we must solve the
problem of removing D2. If, however, we select &quot;becomes simplified&quot; we must to
address the drawback D1, because if we find a satisfactory solution for this problem
statement we do not need an existing means for eliminating the drawback D1 and we can
expect some simplification as a result of that.</p>
<b>

<p>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>About the psychological aspect of seeking minimal changes to the system. </b>It is
true that this function of formulating the mini-problem is usually performed successfully.
However, one may fail to recognize that the system did in fact change, and that these
changes could affect any system level in a positive and/or negative way. ARIZ-85C includes
a procedure for revealing the necessary changes that must be made for implementing the
solution and looking for new solution applications. This, however, is not enough. V.
Gerasimov believes that the situation must be made even &quot;stronger&quot; such that the
statement &quot;Everything has changed&quot; can be made after the solution is obtained.
Today we have ways to reveal both positive changes (super-effect) (Gerasimov and Litvin. <i>Basics
of the method of conducting Value Engineering</i>. Manuscript, 1991), and negative
(subversion analysis) (Zlotin and Zusman. <i>Searching for new ideas in science</i>.
Collected articles &quot;Solving Scientific Problems.&quot; Kishinev,
&quot;Progress,&quot; Kartya Moldovenyaska, 1991).</p>

<p>All of the above provide for the conclusion to be made that, so far, there is no
objective criteria for identifying the mini-problem from an innovation situation. This
does not mean, however, that any preliminary (or at least probabilistic) estimation of the
most promising directions is impossible. Some criteria may be elaborated, but they are
fairly subjective (see ARIZ-SMVA 91(E), Chapter 3, Exhibit 8).</p>

<p>About Local Ideality</b><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p>Besides general ideality which reflects the level of technological evolution, there is
local ideality determined by the specific resources of a given system and situation. For
this reason, a solution with high general ideality may not be all that ideal from the
local point of view. Typical illustration: a problem concerning a circuit breaker</font><font SIZE="5"> </font><font SIZE="3">(Zlotin and Zusman. &quot;Come to a firing range&quot;.
Part 2. Collected articles &quot;How to Become a Heretic&quot; Book series:
&quot;Technology &#150; Youth &#150; Creativity&quot;: Petrozavodsk, Kareliya, 1991).</p>

<p>Reviewing the situation, we note that the problem solved by Zlotin&#146;s student B.
Lyarskiy (Electrosila, St. Petersburg) related to the following situation: It was
necessary to protect a thermal bi-metallic plate from rupturing. The rupture resulted from
the large amount of heat released due to an extremely high level of electrical current.
The destruction mechanism was as follows: Each layer of the bi-metallic plate had its own
coefficient of thermal expansion. Because of the strong heat, the difference between the
actual expansion of each layer was so high that it caused the plate to rupture. The
obtained solution recommended the use of an electro-dynamic breaker (another mechanism of
the system under consideration) for shunting the circuit. Implementing this solution
required very small changes to the system &#150; that is, making several holes in the
existing design.</p>

<p>Later, Altshuller was working with this problem in front of TRIZ educators during the
First TRIZ Conference in Petrozavodsk in 1980. Two additional solutions were obtained:

<ol TYPE="a">
  <li>make one layer of the bi-metallic plate from &quot;shape memory&quot; material to
    compensate for the excessive expansion of the other layer under extreme current</li>
  <li VALUE="2">bend the plate ahead of time in the direction opposite the one that results
    from overheating. This will double the temperature range of safe operation of the plate.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let us compare the solutions described above. It is obvious that the solution, which
uses the shape memory effect, possesses the highest ideality, since it doesn&#146;t
require any changes to the design. The solution with preventive bending has lower ideality
while the first solution (shunting) has the lowest ideality. However, if we reconsider
ideality from the local point of view it becomes clear that the shape memory solution is
practically useless &#150; the plant cannot purchase this material. Moreover, this plate
is a part provided by a supplier, who will not like any changes. At the same time, making
a couple of holes in the existing design to implement the first solution is not a problem
at all. Given the above, this solution has the highest local ideality.</p>

<p>The concept of local ideality leads to a requirement that ARIZ must provide an array of
solutions rather than only one solution. Once a set of solutions is obtained, the one with
the highest local ideality can be selected. It might also be necessary to return the 40
Innovation Principles back to ARIZ. Although the Principles usually produce solutions on
level 2 (for Standard Solutions, level 3), it can very well be that the level 2 solutions
have higher ideality, which means that the Standard Solutions cannot replace the
Principles.</p>
