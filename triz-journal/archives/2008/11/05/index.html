<P>By <A href="#authors">Hongyul Yoon</A></P><H2>Abstract</H2><P>It was required to extract the bindings of Prp19p and other proteins from a lipid droplet for obesity repression research. Extraction of some specific bindings could be done through dissociation of the other protein bindings. Sodium dodecyl sulfate was adopted as a dissociating agent but it also dissociated Prp19p bindings. That contradiction was surmounted with the application of ARIZ-85C, Part 1. The solution idea was proved to be useful to lift Prp19p bindings out of a lipid droplet and sufficiently effective to research.</P><H2>Background</H2><P>The case of this paper followed some earlier biochemical research.<SUP><A href="#ref1">1</A></SUP> This case started just after Siyoung Cho and her colleagues found that Prp19p was important for the research of the repression of obesity. The research finished at the end of 2006 before the publication of the earlier research; a brief explanation of the earlier work follows.</P><P>The repression of obesity is a main target in the pharmaceutical industry. Amore Pacific, one of the leading companies in that area of Korea, found that lipid droplets were the way to conquer obesity.</P><P>Lipid droplets are sub-cellular organelles that are a major energy depot; they store neutral lipids. The biogenesis of a lipid droplet is central to the whole body energy homeostasis. Lipid droplets also seem to have important roles in lipid trafficking in adipocytes, cell signaling and several human diseases. It is, thus, important to understand the mechanism of deposition and mobilization of cellular neutral lipids. It is expected that a set of proteins involved in lipid droplet biogenesis could be composed of effective targets for the regulation of the whole body energy homeostasis. Lipid droplets are surrounded by a hospholipid monolayer into which many proteins are embedded. Some of these droplet-associated proteins are reported to play important roles in the functions of the lipid droplets. As one of them, Prp19p is an integral component of the heteromeric protein complex (the NineTeen Complex or NTC) in the nucleus and it is essential for the structural integrity of NTC and its subsequent activation of the splicesome. Researchers identified Prp19p as a member of proteins associated with lipid droplets. Down regulation of Prp19p expression with RNA interference in 3T3-L1 cells repressed lipid droplet formation with the reduction in the level of expression of perilipin and S3-12. Prp19p or Prp19-interacting proteins during droplet biogenesis in adipocytes may be considered as another class of potential targets for attacking obesity and obesity-related problems.</P><P>In order to research how to control Prp19p-interacting proteins, it has to be possible to isolate the bindings of Prp19p and other proteins. Isolation of target proteins requires dissociation of the bindings of the other proteins in an adipocyte. In general, the recommended dissociating agent is sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). This paper is related to the problem that there was trouble using SDS as a dissociating agent. This paper reflects a Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) consultation from September 15-November 17, 2006. The result of this case was proven effective and has been used for further research.</P><H2>Why TRIZ Was Introduced</H2><P>It is probable that the researchers would have been searching for different dissociating agents as an alternative to SDS through trial-and-error, if TRIZ had not been introduced. Trial-and-error requires lots of time. The researchers wanted faster and more effective procedures for finding solutions. TRIZ was introduced not as the only way to solve the problem, but as a more effective way to overcome the problem. The management of Amore Pacific R&D Center intended to check the effectiveness of TRIZ throughout this project.</P><H2>Initial Problem Situation: Problem Identification</H2><P>Just like the general solving process of a certain problem, the first step of this case was the identification of the problem. It is not likely that a team will&nbsp;identify the ideal final result (IFR) at the start of a project. Generally, the IFR can not be confirmed until the correct contradiction or function relationship is formulated. For correct formulation of contradictions and function relationship, several preliminary steps were needed.</P><P>The first step is identifying what we want. It was effective for problem solving to re-identify what was desired with the ENV (Element – name of feature – value of feature) model of OTSM-TRIZ.<A href="#ref2"><SUP>2</SUP></A><SUP>,<A href="#ref3">3</A></SUP>&nbsp;This model helps to abstract the essence of the problem, which is unlikely to be revealed in a short sentence.</P><P>ENV results from feedback along the problem solving process. After ENV identification of "what we want," it is time to move to the next step. These steps are the author's recommendation for real TRIZ application. Table 1 shows the final ENV model of this case.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=2 cellPadding=2 width="65%" align=center border=1><TBODY><TR><TD bgColor=#000099 colSpan=4><FONT color=#ffffff><STRONG>Table 1:</STRONG> ENV Model to Identify the Project's Goal</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD bgColor=#cccccc><P align=center>&nbsp;</P></TD><TD bgColor=#cccccc><P align=center>&nbsp;</P></TD><TD bgColor=#cccccc colSpan=2><P align=center><STRONG>Value of Feature</STRONG></P></TD></TR><TR><TD bgColor=#cccccc><P align=center><STRONG>Element</STRONG></P></TD><TD bgColor=#cccccc><P align=center><STRONG>Name of Feature</STRONG></P></TD><TD bgColor=#cccccc><P align=center><STRONG>Current</STRONG></P></TD><TD bgColor=#cccccc><P align=center><STRONG>Desired</STRONG></P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P align=center>Other cell components</P></TD><TD><P align=center>Position</P></TD><TD><P align=center>With Prp19p&nbsp;+ proteins</P></TD><TD><P align=center>Away&nbsp;from Prp19p&nbsp;+ proteins</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>Through the ENV model of the goal the general ways to isolate the target, "Prp19p-combined protein,"&nbsp;could be abstracted. Actually, there was no information about what proteins combine with Prp19p in a lipid droplet and it was necessary to dissociate cell components by SDS. SDS was the only detergent that had been found that could complete the required dissociation to all cell components. This situation led to the selection of "co-immunoprecipitation with SDS" as the way to separate the target protein bindings.</P><H2>Multi-screen Thinking Based on OTSM-TRIZ</H2><P>With OTSM-TRIZ, the phase of the problem was identified through multi-screen thinking.<SUP><A href="#ref2">2</A>,<A href="#ref4">4</A></SUP>&nbsp;Multi-screen thinking based on OTSM-TRIZ enabled the identification of which phase should be addressed among several phases of the whole co-immunoprecipitation process.</P><P>As shown in Table 2, several agents like phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and Nonidet P 40 (NP 40) are used for the process. "During reaction with SDS" phase seemed to cause the main problem. SDS could be effective to separate all protein bindings – except the bindings with Prp19p. However, if SDS is changed to the amount needed to dissociate the other cell components, the target protein combination, or Prp19p-Proteins like Prp19p combined with soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion (NSF) protein attachment protein (SNAP)-ap, might also be dissociated to be useless samples for this research. The combination of Prp19p and other not-identified proteins was needed. For a more clarified image of the problem, it was necessary to move on to the function analysis stage of the problematic phase.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=2 cellPadding=2 width="80%" align=center border=1><TBODY><TR><TD bgColor=#000099 colSpan=5><FONT color=#ffffff><STRONG>Table 2:</STRONG> Problem Phase Identification According to Multi-screen Thinking Based on TRIZ</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD bgColor=#cccccc><P align=center><STRONG>Environmental Components</STRONG></P></TD><TD bgColor=#cccccc><P align=center><STRONG>Time -2: Before Introduction of SDS</STRONG></P></TD><TD bgColor=#ff9900><P align=center><STRONG>Time -1: During Reaction with SDS</STRONG></P></TD><TD bgColor=#cccccc><P align=center><STRONG>Time 0: SDS Introduction and Mixing</STRONG></P></TD><TD bgColor=#cccccc><P align=center><STRONG>Time 1: Detecting (Anti-body Introduction)</STRONG>&nbsp;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD bgColor=#cccccc><P align=center><STRONG>Super-system</STRONG></P></TD><TD><P align=center>Other protein, HO NP40, sodium deoxy cholate, PBS</P></TD><TD bgColor=#ff9900><P align=center>Other protein, H2O NP40, sodium deoxy cholate, PBS</P></TD><TD><P align=center>Other protein, H2O NP40, sodium deoxy cholate, PBS</P></TD><TD><P align=center><FONT color=#ff0000>Anti-body: 2 types</FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD bgColor=#cccccc><P align=center><STRONG>System</STRONG></P></TD><TD><P align=center>Prp19p+SNAPap+lipid droplet: binded</P></TD><TD bgColor=#ff9900><P align=center>?</P></TD><TD><P align=center>Prp19p, SNAPap, lipid droplet (all of them are dissociated)</P></TD><TD><P align=center>&nbsp;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD bgColor=#cccccc><P align=center><STRONG>Sub-system</STRONG></P></TD><TD><P align=center>Prp19p, SNAPap, lipid droplet</P></TD><TD bgColor=#ff9900><P align=center>?</P></TD><TD><P align=center>Prp19p, SNAPap, lipid droplet</P></TD><TD><P align=center>&nbsp;</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD bgColor=#ff9900><P align=center><STRONG><FONT size=3>^^&nbsp;</FONT></STRONG>Function Analysis <FONT size=3><STRONG>^^</STRONG></FONT></P></TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><H2>Function Analysis</H2><P>The function analysis was done for the identified problem phase.<SUP><A href="#ref4">4</A></SUP>&nbsp;The result of the function analysis would be used for Part 1, Step 2 of ARIZ-85C.
