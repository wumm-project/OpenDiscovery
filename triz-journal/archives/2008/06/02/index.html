<P>By <A href="#authors">Rogier de Vries, Valeri Souchkov and Jan Mannak</A></P><H2>Introduction</H2><P>Many companies do not possess all the required knowledge or production facilities for performing state-of-the-art product development on their own. In order to overcome this disadvantage, companies may cooperate with other companies or subsidiaries in project-based joint ventures – often the teams are geographically separated. Teams consisting of members from these companies will work separately or together at a specified location which can be impractical in international joint ventures. Team members may be required to work while separated from each other for prolonged periods. It is doubtful whether remote teams can work as effectively as co-located teams. This case study attempts to resolve this issue using the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ).</P><H2>Defining Teamwork Equations</H2><P>Many definitions are available to describe teams and teamwork. According to one definition "a team can be defined as a social system of three or more people, which is embedded in an organization (context), whose members perceive themselves as such and are perceived as members by others (identity), and who collaborate on a common task (teamwork)."<SUP><A href="#ref1">1</A></SUP> Another definition is: "teamwork is the act of two or more persons working together toward a common goal, sharing their time, talents, and knowledge and using methods acceptable to all team participants."<SUP><A href="#ref2">2</A></SUP></P><P>Teamwork can be defined as the coordinated work done by multiple individuals working together toward a common goal. Teamwork is usually promoted because the effect of a coordinated group of people is usually greater than the sum of their individual contributions: bringing people together gives an extra X factor allowing the team to produce better results than when performing solitarily. This effect is shown in Figure 1, where the square box is a team; the narrow boxes are team members, and the X component of the equation finishes the "chemistry of teamwork." </P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=left bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 1:</B> Equation 1 –<BR>&nbsp;Successful Teamwork</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><FONT size=+0><IMG height=69 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-04-rdvsjm01.gif" width=254 border=0></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>Not all teams are a success. The X component can be missing, and adding people together can result in a struggling team that could just produce elements of Y component, the "anti-X" component. Figure 2 reflects team members who do not interact properly. Elements of Y can include: (non-value adding) bureaucracy, personal conflicts between members, conflicting goals and interests, insufficient use of available expertise and leadership conflicts. Together these can result in a failure to meet the common goal.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 2:</B> Equation 2 –<BR>&nbsp;Unsuccessful Teamwork</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"><IMG height=69 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-04-rdvsjm02.gif" width=254 border=0></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>For this research, component X is the additive that creates a perfect chemistry for a team (in the broadest sense of the word) to work. (Every component that is not X is named Y.)</P><H2>Finding X</H2><P>The items of component X in Figure 1 are not always readily available. Component X contains elements that interact with team members, team leaders and their surroundings and allows the team to work in a coherent and effective way. In this case study, to change a successful team's location and retain its synergetic value, it is necessary to have detailed knowledge of the attributes of X to know whether any of these elements is prone to change and needs to be compensated. In this research, if only one element of X is missing, then X will turn into component Y and the team will cease to optimally function as a team.</P><P>In general, the criteria in Table 1 are accepted as cornerstones of teamwork success (also called teamwork quality [TWQ]).<SUP><A href="#ref1">1</A></SUP> Attributes 5 through 7 of the "communication" element are added to provide a more complete overview of this element.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=2 cellPadding=2 width="65%" align=center border=1><TBODY><TR><TD bgColor=#000099 colSpan=3><FONT color=#ffffff><STRONG>Table 1:</STRONG> Cornerstones of Teamwork </FONT><FONT color=#ffffff>Success<SUP><A href="#ref1"><FONT color=#ffffff>1</FONT></A></SUP> </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD bgColor=#cccccc><STRONG>Number</STRONG></TD><TD bgColor=#cccccc><STRONG>Element</STRONG></TD><TD bgColor=#cccccc><STRONG>Description</STRONG></TD></TR><TR><TD>1</TD><TD>Communication</TD><TD>Is communication sufficiently 1) frequent, 2) informal, 3) direct, 4) open, 5) clear, 6) relevant, 7) unambiguous ... ?</TD></TR><TR><TD>2</TD><TD>Coordination</TD><TD>Are individual efforts well structured and synchronized within the team?</TD></TR><TR><TD>3</TD><TD>Balance of member contributions</TD><TD>Are all members able to bring in their expertise to their full potential?</TD></TR><TR><TD>4</TD><TD>Mutual support</TD><TD>Do team members help and support each other in their tasks?</TD></TR><TR><TD>5</TD><TD>Effort</TD><TD>Do team members exert all efforts to the team's tasks?</TD></TR><TR><TD>6</TD><TD>Cohesion</TD><TD>Are team members motivated to maintain the team?

While remote teams clearly require extra tools for correct functioning (e.g., extended/improved email accounts, phone lines, management layers), it is required that the remote team operates equally effective as a co-located team. The distance separation is a prerequisite, but it should not cause constraints. Therefore the quality elements for a co-located team are taken as a basis for remote teamwork analysis.</P><H2>Modelling Geographical Separation of Teams</H2><H3>Case Model Creation</H3><P>To apply TRIZ to solve whether remote teams can work as effectively as co-located teams, a model with two scenarios was created to accurately describe the problem situation: 1) the situation in which a co-located team performed a task and 2) the same task, but performed by two remote sub-teams.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=left bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 3:</B> Co-located and Remote Team Scenarios</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"><IMG height=379 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-04-rdvsjm03.gif" width=307 border=0></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>Scenario 1 (Figure 3, left) represents an optimally functioning team consisting of team members and the synergetic component X. Tasks were equally distributed among the team members and every team member performed a unique job. All team members were needed to perform the tasks at hand. The team members were assumed capable of working in teams, so that any combination thereof would result in an optimally functioning team.</P><P>Scenario 2 (Figure 3, right) involved two remote sub-teams. Each of them was optimally functioning, so there was a component X for each sub-team within their respective sub-system boundaries. This example assumed that the synergy between the two sub-teams was not optimal – not all elements of component X were satisfied on a system level. This contradicted the sub-system level, where all elements of component X were available.</P><H3>Case Model Completion</H3><P>To be able to analyze this case study's issues, a model was produced that showed relevant items and the interactions between them. Table 2 shows the items that were used – most of them were based on the elements of Table 1. These elements were chosen because they were considered to be changing when proceeding from Scenario 1 to Scenario 2 (as shown in Figure 1 and 2); items that did not change were omitted.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=2 cellPadding=2 width="65%" align=center border=1><TBODY><TR><TD bgColor=#000099 colSpan=3><FONT color=#ffffff><STRONG>Table 2:</STRONG> Used Items In Case Model</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD bgColor=#cccccc><STRONG>Number</STRONG></TD><TD bgColor=#cccccc><STRONG>Item</STRONG></TD><TD bgColor=#cccccc><STRONG>Notes</STRONG></TD></TR><TR><TD>1</TD><TD>System cohesion</TD><TD>Represents cohesion on a system level: the level of cohesion of the entire remote team.</TD></TR><TR><TD>2</TD><TD>Sub-team cohesion</TD><TD>Represents cohesion on a sub-system level: the level of cohesion of a sub-team.</TD></TR><TR><TD>3</TD><TD>Coordination</TD><TD>Influences item 1 (system cohesion) and item 2 (sub-team cohesion).

With an excessive amount of potentially informal communication, people have to be close together. The closest possible proximity would be with people sitting or standing in front of each other or side-by-side. Figure 12 (left) shows this situation with two desks adjacent to each other. This configuration is often found in offices. A problem with this configuration is that employees continuously see each other, which may hinder people's feelings of privacy. A cubicle office with semi-permanent low walls that visually separate the desks is introduced (Figure 13, right). This is the needed field, F<SUB>rem</SUB>, introduced in Figure 7. The problem with this layout is that direct visual contact with the fellow employee is hindered while seated. Direct contact can be made by walking around the cubicle walls or by talking out loud. As the targeted situation is not a co-located one, however, the latter form of communication is not an option.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 12:</B> Two-desk and Cubicle Office Layouts</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"><IMG height=128 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-04-rdvsjm12.gif" width=380 border=0></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>To solve this issue, an abstract notion of the problem is needed to try to visualize possible solutions.

The off button might be a quick fix, but should be used with hesitation to not spoil the effect of informality. After all, if a person walks to a nearby cubicle to visit a colleague, that colleague does not have an off button to prevent the person from visiting. The remote cubicle must offer the same possibilities.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=left bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 14:</B> Remote Coffee Machine</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"><IMG height=152 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-04-rdvsjm14.gif" width=211 border=0></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>The principle of simulated cohesion can be applied to other factors that affect informal communication.

There is no difference among the SC-elements, so it does not matter which element is taken, as long as it is near the coordination system. Second, the grabbers place the SC-elements into the system and form a layer around the SC-elements. Third, these shelled elements travel to the reservoir, where they can accumulate without being attacked by the sub-team cohesion elements. Fourth, the elements hatch into the sub-team cohesion area and are changed into ascended SC-elements.The abstract analogy is illustrated in Figure 15.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=left bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 15:</B> Coordination of Porous Substance</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"><IMG height=175 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-04-rdvsjm15.gif" width=300 border=0></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>The case analogy for this system can be given by translating the elements introduced in the abstract analogy to the particular case situation in a series of steps. </P><OL><LI>Project managers or team leaders identify a need to increase system cohesion. The identification process itself is the accumulation of elements of system cohesion. <LI>Small assignments are formed that accommodate system cohesion. These assignments must be carefully produced to make sure they can be solved without sub-team cohesion – one member of each sub-team must be linked to complete the assignment. <LI>The assignments are given to the linked team members. Because the assignments can only be solved with system cohesion, sub-team cohesion cannot harm the assignments. It is as if the assignments sit in a protected reservoir. <LI>When the assignments are performed, they disappear and let the SC-element form a new element: joint experience. The sub-team members now have an experience together that is not based on prejudice, false sub-team pride or any other negative effect. The elements of joint experience as such cannot be harmed by sub-team cohesion, so they will remain active.</LI></OL><H2>Evaluation</H2><H3>Conclusions</H3><OL><LI>Given the assumptions that are made in this article, remote teams in theory can work as effective as co-located teams by using the results from this case study. <LI>This case study has resulted in several feasible concepts for solving certain remote teamwork issues that show that classical TRIZ tools can be used for solving problems that are not technical in the strict sense of the word and also for social or business problems.</LI></OL><H3>Discussion</H3><P>For the sake of this case study, several assumptions were made that simplify the model that describes the functioning of a remote team. So while the case study shows an analysis and solution route that provides several practical solutions, it is based on that simplified model. Other issues might appear in remote teamwork that are not solved by the solutions provided. To be sure that the solutions are useable even considering the simplified model, extensive testing and benchmarking is needed.</P><P>Given the specified limitations, the results of this case study are usable. Building remote cubicles and physical prototypes is costly, and a further study into the sociological effects might be needed for correct implementation. But it is based on present-day technology, and the research mentioned and the design of a communication structure is easy to implement. The application of the small assignments solution should also meet no significant issues in implementing – it requires no new technology or other major capital investments. </P><H2>Acknowledgements</H2><P>The authors would like to thank Thales Nederland B.V. for allowing this research to be performed in this company's context, and Mr. W.
