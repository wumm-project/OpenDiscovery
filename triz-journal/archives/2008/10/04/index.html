Among the factors that accelerate this phenomenon are increased competition, market maturity and the pressure for Quality ISO9000 certification. Project management (PM) procedures were created to increase the probability of success for large military projects. The Project Management Institute® is a nonprofit organization developed to spread project management best practices throughout the world. Founded in 1969, it is now the largest project manager organization, with more then 200,000 members worldwide.&nbsp;According to author John Adams, companies whose activities are characterized by the use of advanced technologies, the presence of highly qualified personnel and a high level of uncertainty are more likely to use PM procedures.<SUP><A href="#ref3">3</A></SUP> </P><P>Because there are so many companies involved in technical innovation, there are always people looking for ways to improve business practices whether through project management or other innovative techniques. Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues (of the former Soviet Union) developed the Theory of Inventive Principles (TRIZ) during the 1950s as a way to find inventive solutions for technical problems. Starting from this technical focus, various authors including Darrell Mann and Valeri Souchkov studied the adaptability of classical TRIZ to management and business problems. Greg Yezersky, author of the <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2008/04/06/">general theory of innovation</A>, proposes a more general approach on systems defined as an "orderly set of elements designed to satisfy a need of the environment."<SUP><A href="#ref6">6</A></SUP> Some of these approaches can address the weaknesses of project management and provide useful insights for over-pressured project managers. </P><H2>The Need for Innovation and Linking PM and TRIZ</H2><P>Society is facing an increasingly complex series of problems – the increasing complexity of technology, <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2006/12/11.pdf">globalization</A>, limited natural resources, climate change, migration, ethnic crises, new economic players and market instability.

According to Harvard professor Clayton M. Christiansen, the global rate of success at the end of the line is less then 10 percent.<SUP><A href="#ref8">8</A></SUP> Figure 1 shows a graphical representation of the approximate standard design process observed in a variety of companies. Considering the sequential structure of this process, it is evident that global efficiency is the product of the efficiency of every block. All blocks need to be optimized to achieve acceptable results, and companies need to excel throughout the cycle to obtain good results.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 1:</B> Typical Phases of Product Development</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=101 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-10-04-01.GIF" width=571 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>In 2005 and 2006 the author interviewed approximately 30 top and middle managers of companies operating in various sectors – automotive, oil, luxury brands and services. These interviews showed how ideas are generated and managed in organizations. The study indicated that idea generation is the weakest step of the whole process as diagrammed in Figure 1. It was also interesting to analyze managers'&nbsp;perceptions of creativity and its link with innovation. The following definitions were used as a reference to evaluate the maturity of the answer:</P><UL><LI>Innovation is the renewal and enlargement of a product's range, services and associated markets; the creation of new production methods, supply and distribution; and the introduction of management changes, work organization, training and workforce environment.<SUP><A href="#ref11">11</A></SUP> <LI>Creativity is a <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2002/02/d/index.htm#top">mental process</A> involving the generation of new ideas or concepts, or new associations between existing ideas or concepts.</LI></UL><P>Using these definitions, the answers were categorized on a scale based on having a good understanding, an acceptable perception and being completely off target. The results were evenly dispersed. Some of the most critical answers were:</P><UL><LI>"The word innovation means nothing to me." <LI>"Creativity and innovation are synonyms." <LI>"I don't want creative people around the R&D (research and development) department, just people capable of doing what we ask them to do." <LI>"For us innovation is just making the same as usual but saving a little more." <LI>"Innovation is just a marketing term to sell more." <LI>"Innovation is killed by our procedures."</LI></UL><P>Recall that the largest benefit of TRIZ is generally achieved at the initial phases of the development cycle – the idea generation and selection phases that normally constitutes less structured activities in companies. Knowing that project management techniques cover all operational steps of the process, from the feasibility analysis to the sales activity, the complementarity of the two approaches become clear. Figure 2 shows that project managing is efficient for the non-creative phases (needs identification, <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2008/04/04/">selection</A>, feasibility, etc.) although systematic innovation techniques are helpful for the design phases.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 2:</B> The Phases of Product Development Catalyzed<BR>&nbsp;by the Synergy of Systematic Innovation and PM Techniques</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=272 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-10-04-02.GIF" width=571 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>The American Project Management Institute (PMI©) classifies PM activities as process groups – initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and control, and closing processes. The processes are schematically divided into input elements, tools and techniques, and output elements.</P><P>Another mapping of PM processes is based on nine knowledge areas:</P><OL><LI><A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2008/09/02">Integration management</A> <LI>Scope management <LI>Time management <LI>Procurement management <LI>Communication management <LI><A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2007/11/02/">Risk management</A> <LI>Human resources management <LI>Quality management <LI>Cost management</LI></OL><P>Today the penetration of PM techniques is continuously increasing, but not all recommended PMI best practices have been fully implemented in companies. Two standards have been created to evaluate PM practice compliance:</P><UL><LI>Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI) by SEI (Software Engineering Institute) <LI>OPM3 (Organizational Project Management Maturity Model) by PMI</LI></UL><P>Preliminary results of audits of these tools by PM professionals and a study performed by the Standish Group showed major management weaknesses in risk, quality and communication management.<SUP><A href="#ref13">13</A></SUP> TRIZ techniques can help improve the global effectiveness of PM. The following example is based on a specific sub-process of PM – risk management.</P><H2>TRIZ and Risk Management</H2><P>Risk management (RM) is&nbsp;an adaptation of the failure mode and effect analysis technique (FMEA) – a safety technique developed in the United States in the 1950s for the design of nuclear weapons. FMEA was adopted in Japan in the energy sector and then spread through Europe in many application fields. Similarly, the military initially developed risk assessment and it was later transferred to other fields. The goal of project risk management is to reduce the probability and gravity of negative events and increase the probability of positive ones. Risk management is an effective method. Unfortunately few organizations adopt it completely and, therefore, they do not receive the full benefits. Normally organizations involved in complex technological projects – <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2003/07/a/01.pdf">chemical</A>, aeronautics, railways – adopt a developed strategy. For less critical projects simplified or no risk management is adopted. What are the reasons behind this slow penetration?</P><P>Often organizations are unaware of the need for risk management and have no structured approach to deal with uncertainty, resulting in a series of crises for each project or operation. The typical organization is mainly reactive, with little or no attempt to learn from past projects or to prepare for future uncertainties or to develop contingency plans. When a critical situation occurs, planning is abandoned and the chances of project success are based on heroic managers and seasoned teams. Occasionally capable managers can identify and work to mitigate risks during the project, but when they leave their influence leaves with them. Another difficulty implementing RM is due to the management procedures and activities that must be in place, together with a lack of a perceived need, to change. Unrealistic expectations can also be a factor as can the lack of a clear vision of what implementation would involve or how it should be managed. </P><P>After an organization realizes the benefits of RM it can use TRIZ tools to boost penetration of risk management. Practitioners can use some standard TRIZ tools as the <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2008/08/05/">system operator</A> (also known as multi-screen analysis) centered on project management, to identify some useful trends.<A href="#ref15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>&nbsp;Below are the results of the analysis. It is quite standard to focus first on global project management activities using the system operator approach – enlarging the focus before treating the specific problem.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 3:</B> Initial System Operator Representation<BR>&nbsp;of Project Management Structure</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><FONT size=+0><IMG height=348 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-10-04-03.gif" width=438 border=0></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>With this multi-level approach, risk management, as an area of knowledge inside project management, is considered a sub-system.

In the Relevent™ representation, an orange box and arrows reflect negative events that block positive events, and can generate the supreme system anti-goal, represented in red.

According to the Relevent™ technique, all improvements must be focused on eliminating or contrasting the negative events – keeping in mind the final super-goal and considering the rest a waste of time and resources. All actions oriented in <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2008/01/02/">resources</A> and time optimization, together with traceability and repeatability of the activity, will be beneficial for the document review. Training on creativity techniques and risk management will be beneficial for information gathering and on using external resources. Defining clear responsibilities and rules in the working environment will also help.</P><H2>Reformulating Risk Management Using TRIZ</H2><P>Reformulating this using TRIZ could reflect that although risk management works, companies do not implement it because of limited resources and knowledge. The main functions of RM are:</P><UL><LI>To identify risks <LI>To find countermeasure for negative risks and facilitations for positive one <LI>To monitor and control actions on risks</LI></UL><P>Figure&nbsp;8 portrays a possible functional model where the functions can later be considered insufficient or absent.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 8:</B> Simplified Functional Representation for Risk Management</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=225 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-10-04-08.GIF" width=538 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>Below are some possible TRIZ solution strategies:</P><UL><LI>Trim RM and fully delegate it to the company structure, i.e., take it from the project and delegate it to the company structure with a centralized function of RM or to an external entity. <LI>Delegate single functions to external companies/experts leaving the project team with the remaining tasks. By delegating the most demanding functions that require extensive time, knowledge, etc., to an external source or another part of the company, the project team can focus entirely on the remaining issues. <LI>Implement a software solution to facilitate processes for the project team allowing them to maximize their time, resources and knowledge.<BR>Project managers can also apply TRIZ to the <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2007/01/03/">law of completeness of systems</A>.<SUP><A href="#ref10">10</A></SUP></LI></UL><P>In Figure&nbsp;9 this law is applied to risk management and identifying the engine, the transmission, the tool and the control element.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 9:</B> Application of Law of Completeness for Risk Management</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=402 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-10-04-09.GIF" width=405 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>The essential elements shown are the engine and the transmission. RM is a value-added activity where know-how and experience are necessary. The control function can be maintained and delegated to a small RM team or assigned back to the company. RM takes time and know-how that can be either found within the organization or through an outside agency. Companies working on a single product/market may better off investing money on RM for long-term purposes. Once RM is established it involves minimal effort.</P><P>Another TRIZ approach is to highlight the essential problem behind the low penetration of risk management as the main technical and physical contradictions.</P><H3>Technical contradiction</H3><UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px"><LI>RM increases project reliability but lessens ease of operation: relevant principles segmentation (break RM down, delegate or replace external functions) and the other way around (allow risk and be accountable afterward, involve customers in RM, etc.) <LI>RM increases project reliability but also complexity: relevant principle cheap disposables. Adopt simplified RM techniques without complex/costly considerations. Apply RM procedures with trivial or less refined results – life-long learning, re-dynamisation, breathing time in projects, a pre-packaged RM, etc. <LI>RM increases project reliability but takes time: relevant principle&nbsp;prepare in advance (Act beforehand, i.e., do preventive work, externalization and collaboration with strategy/marketing consultants and joint ventures.)</LI></UL><H3>Physical contradiction</H3><UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px"><LI>RM should be conducted but is not. <LI>Separate in project space – break functions down and delegate to different project resources that may not be fully engaged in the project. <LI>Delegate to the super-system – spread RM&nbsp;across all project/resources making it a cultural factor that can facilitate/better integrate the work of the RM team. <LI>Delegate to the sub-system – delegate to single resources placing RM responsibility on them, or integrate organizational efforts so all risk managers create a larger RM package.</LI></UL><H2>Conclusion</H2><P>Innovation is a goal for many companies and institutions. Precise techniques like project management can be used to assist and control the emergence of innovation. While these techniques are well formalized, often there is little control of the ideation phases where TRIZ has already proven efficient. In this article, the author integrated the ideation phase and project management using TRIZ techniques to improve current project management techniques – multi-screen analysis, Relevent diagrams, evolution laws, as well as technical and physical contradictions. These tools offer guidelines to improve project management techniques.</P><P>The integration of project management best practices and TRIZ can be fruitful in developing new products, processes and services. TRIZ can bring a new perspective to project management theory as well as support project managers in finding fresh ideas and solutions for typical project optimization problems.
