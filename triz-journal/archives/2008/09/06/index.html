</A></P><P><EM>The TRIZ Journal</EM> has two new editorial panel members: Paul Filmore and Marco de Carvalho. Both have authored articles in <EM>The TRIZ Journal</EM> – here are some of their finer moments.</P><H3>Marco de Carvalho</H3><P><A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2000/09/d/index.htm">100+ Heuristics for Systems Transformations: A Brief Report of US Patent Fund Study</A></P><P>One of the most popular TRIZ tools is the Altshuller's Matrix that includes (in its classical form) 40 principles for resolving so-called technical or pair contradictions. These 40 principles were selected by TRIZ's creator from the&nbsp;analysis of huge number of high-level patents.</P><P>Less known (even for many TRIZniks from ex-USSR) are the heuristics for technical systems transformations selected from numerous design works of highly experienced engineers by A.I. Polovinkin and his co-workers.</P><P><A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2005/07/02.pdf">Review: Systematic Innovation Newsletter by CREAX</A></P><P>Since the beginning of 2005, those of us fortunate to be on Simon Dewulf's mailing list have been receiving the CREAX Newsletter. This is a refreshing way of tying today's technological advances to their underlying TRIZ components.</P><P><A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2002/04/f/default.asp#top">Comments on "If TRIZ Is Such a Good Idea…"</A></P><P>Back in 1993, just after finishing my B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering, I went to Germany and worked as a trainee at a German plant of a famous American company. There, I worked at "Vorschlagswesen" Suggestions Department. First, I spent&nbsp;one month helping with the bureaucratic process of managing suggestions. </P><H3>Paul Filmore</H3><P><A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2008/02/05/">Key to Teaching TRIZ: Breaking Mindsets</A></P><P>Present education often has a dysfunctional approach in that it gives students knowledge and examples of how to solve problems using that knowledge, and then assumes that the student will (somehow, by a process similar to osmosis) understand how to solve further problems in that domain. In reality there appears to be little focus on teaching how to solve problems systematically, particularly real-life problems that are "messy" and extend into a number of domains. This paper is based on six years of teaching systematic problem solving in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and the special place that the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) has in this arena.</P><P><A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2006/09/02.pdf">The Real World: TRIZ in Two Hours for Undergraduate and Masters Level Students!</A></P><P>The reality of overloaded university syllabi is very limited time for introducing challenging and comprehensive concepts like TRIZ. This paper shares experience and knowledge, based on five years of ‘teaching' TRIZ in the UK. Key areas covered are:</P><UL><LI>Creating a need in the student to learn more e.g., demonstrate that TRIZ has more potential than student's other present problem solving strategies<LI>Using an interesting learning case study; researched by the author with Michelin (USA): the Tweel™<LI>Reporting the use of a computer assessment based on the lecture and self study. The assessment focuses students to access an electronic TRIZ book, electronic resources and the Internet, to self study greater understanding of TRIZ (NB this is one way to get around limited timetabled lecture time). Results from student perceptions of their understanding of TRIZ and of experiencing a rich learning environment, are also examined.</LI></UL><P><A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2006/08/04.pdf">Why Reinvent the Wheel? The Efficacy of Systematic Problem Solving Method TRIZ and Its Value for Innovation in Engineering and Its Implications for Engineering Management</A></P><P>The engineering industry needs to be more innovative. A case study of a recent breakthrough innovative development by Michelin is discussed. The influence of prior training with systematic problem solving method TRIZ, on the innovation team, is assessed using a questionnaire. The questionnaire is based on a company innovation audit model proposed by Mann and influenced by the creativity model of Baille. Results are discussed which show significant innovation development when using TRIZ. The efficacy of training key workers in systematic problem solving and creative methods is discussed and the implications for managers in innovation promotion and workplace environment change are highlighted.</P><center><table border="0"><tr><td>
