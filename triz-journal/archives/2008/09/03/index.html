<P>By <A href="#authors">Gafurov Alisher and Pyoun Young Shik</A></P><H2>Abstract</H2><P>The differential is a key mechanism for providing vehicular stability and mobility. A variety of differentials are built and used in sport utility vehicles (SUV) and recreational vehicles. Problems exist with the current differentials available on the market; the industry requires better solutions. This article explains the function, structure and types of differential mechanisms. In addition the authors have provided a glimpse at a new design with a detailed three-dimensional CAD (computer aided TRIZ-based design) model followed by a CAE (computer aided engineering) analysis with verified test results. The authors used the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) to evaluate a simplified ideality of a new design. </P><P><STRONG>Key words</STRONG>: TRIZ, inventive principle, limited slip differential, contradiction matrix</P><H2>Introduction</H2><P>Maximizing engine power in diverse road conditions is a concern in automotive engineering, because losing power significantly affects vehicular stability and mobility. While stability and mobility are critical for all drivers, they impact "off-road" drivers more. Mobility is especially important in modern sport utility vehicles (SUV) and recreational vehicles (RV), which combine the towing capacity of pickup trucks, the passenger-carrying space of minivans, or station wagons with on and off road capabilities. Stability and mobility are important while driving in the city and both are impacted when the driving wheels simultaneously encounter different road surfaces – one wheel on ice and the other on asphalt. When this occurs, the wheel on the slippery surface spins faster than the wheel on asphalt. Most drivers know from experience that applying more engine power to the wheel is useless, because the spinning will worsen. Power must be directed to the wheel with better traction to increase mobility. Unfortunately, it is impossible with a standard (open) differential unit, which is designed with equal torque distribution to both drive axles.</P><P>Specially built differentials like limited slip differentials (LSD), automatic lockers (mechanical locking differentials), on-command lockers and spools may solve the problem. These units all have advantages and disadvantages, and buyers should select a differential based on their potential driving conditions. For city driving combined with off-road driving the LSD is a good choice – it requires minimal attention from the driver, is easy-to-maintain, is simple in design and fits most general driving requirements. The LSD also has some major weaknesses – it wears out quickly, is noisy and can be unreliable. Using these weaknesses as a platform, the authors developed a new evolutionary cone type LSD that uses modern technology to eliminate existing problems. </P><H2>TRIZ Analysis of Standard Differential</H2><H3>The Role and Function of Standard Differential</H3><P>When a vehicle negotiates a turn the outside wheel must travel farther and turn faster than the inside wheel. Pinion gears (Figure 1) allow the outside wheel to turn faster than the ring gear, while the inside wheel turns slower than the ring gear. The net sum of the speed of the two wheels is twice as fast as the ring gear – if the outside wheel is turning 5 rpm (revolutions per minute) faster than the ring gear, the inside wheel is turning 5 rpm slower than the ring gear. This differential action is simple in a standard differential and normally the unit functions well, distributing power to both driving wheels.</P><P>When a vehicle with a standard differential encounters a loose traction surface it directs power to the wheel with the least resistance. The wheel on the loose surface then spins, while the wheel with better traction remains still. A standard differential is designed to provide equal force to both sides – if a wheel on either side loses traction, the other side also suffers.<SUP><A href="#ref1">1</A></SUP> If, for example, the left wheel loses traction and cannot provide resistance back to the differential side gear, then the right side gear cannot transfer force to the right wheel to counteract the slipping left wheel. An open differential provides equal torque to both sides; not equal speed.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 1:</B> An Open Differential</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=299 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-09-gapys_a.gif" width=461 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 2:</B> An Open Differential Function Block Diagram Under Normal Conditions</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=419 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-09-gapys_b.gif" width=626 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>Figure 2 outlines the differential mechanism under normal conditions. In this diagram driving torque is equally distributed between the left and right drive wheels. The reaction torque, which is a function of the tire rolling radius, down-force and friction coefficient of the surface, determines the proportional driving torque that can be applied to the driving wheels. A vehicle has stable or neutral handling when the driving torque on the wheel does not exceed the reaction torque.</P><H3>Problem Definition and Contradictions</H3><P>TRIZ users define problems as either technical or physical contradictions. Sometimes it is difficult to find a solution for a defined technical contradiction. If this occurs, an engineer can reformulate the problem as a physical contradiction and find a solution utilizing suggested principles along with physical effects and phenomena. The purpose is to identify the characteristics of the desired and undesired results. These characteristics define the physical contradiction. The authors have attempted to use both technical and physical means to define the problem. </P><P>The differential unit has several characteristics that may be considered technical contradictions: a simple design; cheap to build; easy to repair/replace; long life; good for handling in straight-ahead driving and cornering; less tire scrub; supplies equal torque; directs power to the slipperiest wheel at all times; impossible to redirect more power to another wheel with better traction; cannot stop the wheel from spinning; almost useless in off-road and abnormal conditions.</P><P>Based on these characteristics the authors identified conflicts and defined them as technical contradictions for the differential mechanism:</P><UL><LI>Improving stability decreases mobility: if the drive wheels rotate independently maneuvering is easy, but during abnormal or off-road conditions the vehicle will get stuck. <LI>Improving mobility decreases stability: if the drive wheels are locked together (a solid axle), both driving wheels will have equal power and the vehicle will not get stuck, but the vehicle is extremely difficult to maneuver.</LI></UL><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 3:</B> Open Differential Function at Instantaneous (Transient) Phase on Abnormal Road Surfaces</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=431 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-09-gapys_c.gif" width=626 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>Technical contradictions could also be transformed into physical contradictions and reformulated as: "The axle must be "solid" to have maximum traction and avoid spinning, at the same time the axle must be "non-solid" (open) to allow independent tire rolling and easy handling."</P><P>Figure 3 is a graphical representation of the problem with an open differential. Although braking is often instantaneous and instinctive, it can significantly vehicle's a vehicle's stability and may have catastrophic consequences. Therefore, braking is not always the correct response for a driver. While stalling the forward inertia/movement of the vehicle relieves or prevents the immediate loss of stability, it may not be enough to restore complete stability. If, for example, a drive wheel suddenly hits a slippery-surface – gravel, mud, ice, etc. – stability is immediately compromised and the driver must work hard to maintain control of the vehicle to avoid an accident. <BR></P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 4:</B> Open Differential Function at a Steady Phase on Abnormal Road Surfaces</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=431 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-09-gapys_d.gif" width=626 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>The situation changes if a vehicle gets stuck (Figure 4) and loses traction. The engine is still capable of producing enough driving torque, but it is limited by wheel's loose wheel's reaction torque. The standard differential continues distributing engine torque equally, but the power is not enough to move the car. Increasing power results in the right wheel spinning uselessly.</P><H3>Solutions of Technical Contradiction for Standard Differential</H3><P>The standard differential is well-suited for the primary task for which it is designed. But, as described earlier, abnormal road conditions will make an open differential useless. The design should reflect a new product that can handle abnormal conditions and combines on- and off-road performances. The contradiction matrix, however, does not contain "design" parameters. Therefore, another close interpretation of the target was made as an improvement of shape and the degraded parameter is adaptability. These parameters were selected because if the differential is adapted for only off-road conditions then the performance is worse when driving under normal conditions – reliability gets better, but adaptability worsens. The contradiction table offers several principles to analyze for this problem – principles 15 and 29 provide an idea for future development: </P><BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><P><STRONG><EM>15 – Dynamicity</EM></STRONG><BR>a)&nbsp;Make the characteristics of an object or outside environment automatically adjust for optimal performance at each stage of the operation.<BR>b)&nbsp;Divide an object into elements capable of changing position relative to each other.<BR>c)&nbsp;If an object is immovable, make it movable or interchangeable.<BR><STRONG><EM>29 – Use a pneumatic or hydraulic construction</EM></STRONG><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Replace solid parts of an object with gas or liquid.

Both wells rotate regardless of the road surface and maintain maximum power. The NSD appears to be a good solution, and the manufacturer describes it as smooth with no ratcheting sounds. The differential unlocks slightly while cornering so the outer wheel can roll faster.</P><P>Independent sources claim that during a corner, when the differential differentiates (separates and unlocks) it sends all power to the inside wheel trying to force the vehicle straight ahead. When a driver presses the throttle the car goes into an "under steer" condition and can result in a loss of control during inclement weather.The NSD should, therefore, be reserved for serious off-road driving where a locking differential is the only way to avoid getting stuck and remain mobile.</P><H2>TRIZ Analysis of a Limited Slip Differential</H2><P>The LSD (limited slip differential) was primarily designed for on-road and light duty off-road applications. The LSD solved harsh cornering problems while sacrificing traction capabilities. The traction deficit was not an issue, however, because there is no need for constant traction within a city. Limited slip differentials are not the ideal solution. Side effects include increased friction during cornering. Unnecessary friction shortens the lifetime of the friction components and eventually the LSD becomes an open differential.</P><H3>The Role and Function of LSD</H3><P>An LSD is the same device as a standard differential with the exception of an additional function – it provides more power to the wheel with better traction when the wheel begins to spin. It modifies the load-equalizing action with a certain amount of speed-equalizing action enhancing vehicle mobility and stability.</P><P>The basic working principle of the LSD is the same as the open differential – torque generated by the engine is transmitted to the ring gear, which is bolted to the casing. In turn, the casing transmits the torque to the side using spider gears connected to the casing by a pinion shaft. The side gears are splined and turn with the drive axles. Torque from side gears is transmitted to the wheels through these splined axles as shown in Figure 6.</P><P>The unique element of the LSD is its torque biasing mechanism that cannot be found in a standard differential. The torque biasing mechanism differs among limited slip differentials: springs (Belleville springs, coil springs or leaf springs) with the friction discs, helical gear sets, plates for fluid shearing, etc.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 6:</B> A Clutch Type LSD Function Block Diagram Under Normal Conditions</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=431 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-09-gapys_f.gif" width=626 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>Consider the torque bias principle of a clutch type LSD. This principle takes advantage of "gear separating forces." Preloaded springs initiate the development of side gear separating forces that provide further braking action between the side gears and the differential casing. In general, gear separating forces are forces induced, due to the angle of contact (or "pressure angle") on any set of meshing gears by applying torque to the gears and then separating them. When one wheel is on a surface with a low coefficient of friction, the initial preload creates contact and frictional engagement between the differential casing and the clutch mechanism disposed between the side gears and the differential casing allowing the engine to provide torque to the wheel with traction. (See Figure 7.) This initial torque transfer induces gear-separating forces on the side gears that then separate the gears and causes them to frictionally engage the clutch mechanism with the casing. The increased friction of the clutch develops more torque between the casing and the clutch element, thus increasing the side gear separating forces and limiting the slippage between the side gears and the differential casing.<SUP><A href="#ref2">2</A></SUP></P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 7:</B> LSD Function at Instantaneous (Transient) Phase on Abnormal Road Surfaces</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=435 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-09-gapys_g.gif" width=626 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>Limited slip differentials can be categorized into two groups: mechanical and fluid based.<FONT size=+0><SUP><A href="#ref3">3</A></SUP> </FONT>In the mechanical group clutch packs, cone, and cam or helix gears are mostly used and in a fluid-based group, the viscous coupling LSD is used (Figure 8).

These strikes, described as micro-cold forging, bring severe plastic deformation to surface layers and created a nano crystal microstructure. The nano microstructure modification of the surface layer can simultaneously improve both the strength (hardness) and ductility (toughness) of the workpiece according to the Hall-Petch theory. This process also improves surface roughness and induces compressive residual stress in surface layers, which then improve the fatigue strength of the work piece.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 11:</B> Schematic of a UNSM Device</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=259 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-09-gapys_k.gif" width=510 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>The ultrasonic apparatus shown in Figure 11 consists of piezoelectric transducer, a booster (which amplifies and transmits the vibration) and a horn.

The basic formula from the theory of TRIZ states the ideality is equal to the sum of useful effects over the sum of harmful effects. Any form of cost (including waste and pollution) is included in the undesired effect. System costs include occupying space, noise emission, energy consumption, etc. Design changes resulting in any combination of increases to the numerator and decreases to the denominator bring the system closer to the ideal design.</P><P>In actual cases, evaluation of the ideality can be difficult due to the complexity of the system itself. The following is a simplified formula for useful and harmful effects:<SUP><A href="#ref13">13</A></SUP></P><P><IMG height=41 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-09-gapys_q.gif" width=168 border=0></P><BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Where: TBR – torque bias ratio of LSD (Target TBR);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost – market price of the unit (approximately: $450 for existing design and $300 for new design).</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 17:</B> Ideality of the System: Existing Solution, New Solution and Ideal Result</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=226 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2008-09-gapys_r.gif" width=496 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>For the evaluation, the authors chose TBR and durability/reliability over the cost of the unit. To simplify, an assumption is made that all useful effects of existing and newly developed LSDs are the same. For convenience, the sum of TBR and durability/reliability for both (existing and new) designs is substituted with "one." Then the ratio of one over the cost is represented in a percentage. As seen in Figure 17, a newly proposed solution is closer to the ideality. It is still, however, far from the ideal result. <FONT size=2>An evolution line could read: ...&lt;0.222 (existing) &lt;0.333 (new) &lt;...&lt;1 (ideal final result).</FONT></P><P>The ideality estimation in this paper is extremely simplified. Conducting a TBR analysis of the LSD in normal driving conditions would allow for a better estimate, because a preloaded status of a LSD creates not only positive but also negative effects. Determining the optimum TBR range will be a future study.</P><H2>Conclusion</H2><P>During this study the authors introduced TRIZ to solving the problem with an open differential and a LSD. While describing detailed operating principles of the differential unit, they identified contradictions and discovered basic solutions through TRIZ. A non-slip differential includes solutions for the standard differential. New contradictions will arise with the new functional requirements and constrains of the system.</P><P>Various types of limited slip differentials are sophisticated solutions to the existing problem. Nevertheless, analyses show that LSDs also have major problems. Contradictions with LSD are solved by the application of nano surface modifications technology and a developed solution was explained through the 39 engineering parameters, 40 inventive principles and the contradiction matrix. TRIZ is primarily used to find design parameters that are consistent with contradictions based on the technical contradiction analysis tool.</P><P>The ideality of the new evolutionary cone type LSD is evaluated in a simple form here; a detailed study is planned for future projects.</P><H2>References</H2><OL><LI><A name=ref1></A>Thiessen, Frank J., and Dales, Davis N., <EM>Automotive Principles & Service, Fourth Edition</EM>, Prentice-Hall Inc., 1994. <LI><A name=ref2></A>Forrest, James L., United States Patent, US 6261202 B1. <LI><A name=ref3></A>Pyoun, Y.
