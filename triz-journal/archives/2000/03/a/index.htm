<h1><b><font size="2">INTRODUCTION</font></b></h1>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most if not all engineering systems
experience a strength versus weight conflict of some description. The
contradiction most commonly manifests itself in the balance designers attempt to
strike between the need to ensure adequate strength, and the parallel desire to
utilise the minimum amount of material, and thus achieve the lowest cost.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strength/weight conflict plays a
particularly important role in the design of bridges. In order to remain
competitive in the bridge engineering sector, designers are forced into a
perpetual drive to achieve bridge designs which use less materials than their
predecessors.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historical evidence firmly suggests
that, using traditional design approaches, this quest for ever better
strength/weight ratios – coupled with other factors -&nbsp; inevitably leads
to some kind of catastrophic failure:-</font></p>

<p><b><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></b><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably
the most widely reported – and thus most famous – bridge failure of all
time, the 1940 failure of the Tacoma Narrows suspension bridge (Figure 1),
represents a classic case of the consequences of pushing a design too far. The
failure is extremely well documented in this context in Reference 1.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The history of suspension
bridges before and around the time of the Tacoma Narrows failure is revealing in
the context of the drive by designer’s to produce designs of ever increasing
span. The main driver of course was to reduce the amount of time, material and
thus cost of the bridge. As in all prudent design, bridge material requirements
were calculated on the basis of strength calculations onto which significant
factors of safety were added. As experience in the design of suspension bridges
grew, these safety factors were driven downwards in order to reduce material
usage. History shows, that the factors are edged downwards and downwards until
failure occurred:-</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following each incident, again as in all
good design, the experiences of one failure influenced the design of successive
bridges – usually prompting a modification in design style and an increase in
safety factor levels. Then, as experience with the new design style increased,
the safety factors were gradually reduced again… until the next failure
occurred. And so on.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reference 1 evidence firmly
suggests that the Tacoma Narrows Bridge failure occurred because the particular
style employed in the design exceeded the fundamental limits of the
strength-weight contradiction of the particular design style. More specifically,
the failure occurred because the design rules used were incomplete. This same
phenomenon is present in all the failures detailed in Table 1.</font></p>

<h3 align="center"><b><font size="2">Figure 2: Typical Route to Failure of
Design Rules</font></b></h3>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process described by the figure sees
the designer first calculating the required strength of a bridge. The designer
then adds a safety factor to take into account of uncertainties. As experience
grows, subsequent designers – seeing that an earlier design has not failed –
are encouraged to reduce safety factors in order to reduce material usage. This
process repeats until a failure occurs. In retrospect, it is then determined
that the failure occurred because the ACTUAL strength required was higher than
the CALCULATED strength required. The difference between the two values usually
emerges because of an effect which was either considered to be secondary or was
not considered at all during the formulation of the original strength
calculation rules.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the Tacoma Narrows failure
the missing effect was the passage of wind over the bridge. Failure to take
account of this effect meant that the bridge had insufficient torsional
strength.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In evolutionary terms, the Tacoma
Narrow Bridge design style had exceeded the limits of its fundamental strength
versus weight capability.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequent suspension bridge designs
in which there was a desire to increase span length beyond the 2600ft of Tacoma
Narrows, required a change in the design paradigm.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In TRIZ terms, the Tacoma Narrows
Bridge encountered an administrative contradiction between the demand for
spanning greater gaps with less material, and the fundamental ability of the
design style to meet the demand (NB this definition of the administrative
contradiction differs from several other definitions – see Footnote). TRIZ
findings show that progress beyond this limit demands a change in paradigm. A
good example of this as far as suspension bridges are concerned is the Akashi
Kaikyo Bridge, linking the islands of Honshu and Shikoku in Japan (Figure 3),
which has a centre section span of over 6500ft. Stability is maintained in this
structure through incorporation of pendulum-like devices on the towers to keep
them from swaying and a stabilizing fin beneath the centre deck to resist high
winds</font></p>

Matrix, it is perhaps interesting to note here that with the Technical
Contradiction between the desire to improve the weight of the bridge and
worsening effect this has on the stability, leads to ‘Periodic Action’ as
one of the recommended Inventive Principles. This is very encouraging in light
of the fact that the idea of a pendulum is probably not an instinctive response
to the bridge stability problem.)</font></p>

greater and greater strength/weight ratios. A graph showing the historical trend

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prediction made by Sibley and
Walker in the Table 1 list of bridge failures that the evolution of cable-stayed

the failure will come for the reasons shown in Figure 2 – i.e. due to the
emergence of an unknown factor which makes actual strength required greater than
the calculated strength required.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strength/weight contradiction
will exist as long as bridges exist. Bridges will exist as long as it takes
someone to invent a teleportation system. Until then, bridge designers are in
the middle of a contradiction chain (Reference 4). In the above analogy too, the
cliff edge continues to exist as long as bridges exist. Each successive
inventive step to improve strength/weight capability (e.g. the step from
suspension to cable-stayed) represents the location of a piece of safer ground
which allows the blindfolded man to progress further in the direction he is
being drawn towards.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The administrative contradiction
concept is discussed further in Reference 3 with respect to the evolution of

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TRIZ helps to fundamentally overcome
the inherent limitations of each generation of a design concept by providing
designers with tools which allow them to systematically break out of the
existing design trade-off scenarios. One of the fundamental (limiting)
contradictions in bridge design concerns the desire to improve (reduce) WEIGHT
and to prevent STRENGTH from getting worse. In light of the Table 1 conjecture
that a cable-stayed bridge failure will result from a STABILITY related problem,
we might also examine what TRIZ has to say about this contradiction:-</font></p>

<p><font size="2">(*) Example I – incorporation of segmented fins to perform
the stabilising function. Segmentation means use of less fin materials .
Introduction of gap between fin segments suggests possible means of absorbing
harmful wind energy and using it to perform a useful function – e.g. power
generation, Helmholz effect, etc.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example II – Segmentation plus Parameter
Changes equals possible transition to segments of the bridge utilising
fluid-based segments (fluid because it forms the next step along the
evolutionary path towards ideality) to provide certain strength/motion damping
properties (e.g. as utilised in fluid power systems, fluid is very good at
transmitting compressive loads). In that the bridge probably passes over water,
there is probably plenty of opportunity to utilise an existing resource as well!</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The administrative contradiction definition <i>‘a
contradiction between the demand and the ability to meet the demand</i>’ comes
from the Salamatov TRIZ text (Reference 3, pp146-149). The definition is
somewhat different from other TRIZ definitions which traditionally identify this
type of contradiction as one between a physical requirement of the problem and a
man-made (cost, risk, time, etc) requirement. The Salamatov definition is felt
to be more useful in the context of the type of bridge design issues discussed
here.</font></p>
