<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>As is known, the concept of physical contradictions is one of the
cornerstones of TRIZ.</p>
<p>It is also well known that they are resolved with the help of so called
&quot;separation principles&quot;. What is the history behind the idea of
separation principles in the whole and each and every principle in particular?</p>
<p>The present paper aims to answer this question.</p>
<p><b>Year 1973 AD.</b></p>
<p>Due to G. Filkovsky [1], the concept of physical contradictions was proposed
by Perelstein, a physicist. It should had happened before the fall of 1973
because when in the fall of 1973 I enrolled The Azerbaijan Public Institute for
Inventive Creativity (AzOIIT), we were already taught physical contradictions.
We were also taught that they are resolved by separating contradictory
requirement either in space or time. Who was behind the latter idea I do not
know but it is plausible to guess that he was the same Perelstein for whom as a
physicist space-time thinking was natural.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards I was also exposed to the work by Irina Flikstein whose
main thesis was that strong inventions are obtained by applying not one of 40
methods/principles of invention but by applying them in pairs: principle +
anti-principle. For example, splinting was recommended to apply along with
uniting.</p>
<p>Being a mathematician, I immediately noticed that something is wrong with
this idea because application of an operator/action along with its
anti-operator/anti-action should leave system intact. This was the starting
point of my research.</p>
<p>The examples in the Flikstein's work clearly showed that both operator and
anti-operator were applied. But how come that they did not cancel each other, I
wondered? OK, in mechanics opposite forces do not cancel each other if they are
applied to different portions/sides of an object. On the contrary, opposite
forces applied to different sides can transform the object or set it into
rotation. Maybe the inventive operators/principles are also applied to different
&quot;sides&quot; of a system, I questioned?</p>
<p>Thus, the idea of conjugate &quot;sides&quot; of a system was born. The
&quot;sides&quot; were defined merely as conjugate views or representations of a
system. For example, you can view a system as a whole or can view it as
consisting of parts, etc. My thesis was that strong inventions were obtained by
applying the opposite operators to such conjugate &quot;sides&quot; (views,
representations) of a system.</p>
<p>By then I already was taught that strong inventions are results of resolving
physical contradictions. It was not difficult to guess that physical
contradictions are hence resolved by applying opposite operators to conjugate
&quot;sides&quot; of system.</p>
<p>In other words, if we are given a contradiction &quot;object should have
property A and should not have property A&quot; then it will turn to be resolved
if one &quot;side&quot; of the object has property A and the conjugate
&quot;side&quot; does not have it. I called this principle &quot;the principle
of resolving physical contradictions by separating contradictory requirements
between conjugate/dual sides of an object&quot;. The separation in space-time
turned out to be a particular case of this principle.</p>
<p>The other separation principles immediately followed. For example, if we use
&quot;parts and the whole” conjugate &quot;sides&quot; of object, then we
obtain a new separation principle: the parts of a system should have property A
but as a whole it should not have property A. The manuscript outlining this
theory and presenting a number of new separation principles was published in
1974 [2].</p>
<p><b>Years 1974 - 1980.</b></p>
<p>The theory did not get blessing from G. S. Altshuller. He continued to insist
that contradictory requirements can be only separated either in space or time.
&quot;What else can be?” - he questioned - &quot;It is physical
contradictions. Physics deals with space and time...&quot;</p>
<p>The tables turned in 1975 when Altshuller suddenly recognized separation
between parts and the whole. I was elevated. I recollected him his own argument
against my theory that physics deals with space and time and hence physical
contradictions can be only resolved by separating in space or time. Separation
between parts and the whole obviously did not support this thesis. Then
Altshuller countered that contradictory requirements can also be separated in
phase transitions. In other words, if he acknowledged that he was wrong with
respect to the number of possible methods then let him be right with respect to
what nature such methods should have. They should be something of physics!</p>
<p>To this day I view this method (separation in phase transition) as something
artificial born in the heat of polemics. To this day I do not see the usefulness
of this method as well as where is separation here. To this day I consider it as
alien to the idea of separation and as absolutely redundant.</p>
<p>The two new methods were incorporated into ARIZ and first officially
published in 1979 in &quot;Creativity as an exact science&quot; [3]. I continued
to persuade Altshuller that there are an indefinite number of separation
principles all derived from the above theory till 1980. In 1980 the theory was
officially published in &quot;The technology and science&quot; magazine [4] but
Altshuller broadcasted the information to that effect that my publication is not
a TRIZ one.</p>
<p>Why Altshuller rejected the other separation principles? I have the only
explanation to that. I could not provide examples on these principles from
mechanical (or electro-mechanical) engineering - the only field of engineering
Altshuller knew and understood, but which was not the area of my expertise. On
the other hand, my examples from software and algorithms engineering were
unclear to him.</p>
<p><b>Epilogue.</b></p>
<p>Since 1981 our ways diverged. I did not meet Altshuller for years. In the
meantime I wrote and published papers not necessarily related to separation
principles. One of them just dealt with some algebra of system transformations
[5]. In particular, it discussed the following transformations:</p>

<p>When in 1986 I bought the latest Altshuller's book &quot;Find an idea&quot;
[6], I was surprised to learn that the transformations I described were
incorporated into ARIZ-85 as guess what? As new separation principles! Probably
for Altshuller I became inseparable from separation.</p>
