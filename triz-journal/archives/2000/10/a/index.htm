<p>TRIZ and its many embodiments in various consulting and software programs is
a powerful addition to set of problem solving tools available to engineers,
human resource managers, organizational development personnel, and strategic
planners. However, as many suppliers of software, training, and consulting
services have found, it is not necessarily easy to gain acceptance of a new tool
no matter how good we in the TRIZ community think it is. This presentation will
review the barriers to acceptance and suggestions on ways to overcome them.</p>
<p>As everyone who uses the TRIZ methodology, its software embodiments, and its
various enhancements knows, it is a powerful tool for problem analysis and
solution. Many TRIZ problem solvers have seen TRIZ techniques solve problems
unsolvable by other methods and teams of people working for long periods of
time. If this is true, why has TRIZ not taken off in the same way as other
widely accepted industrial problem solving processes and tools? Or is it that we
are simply impatient and its adoption is on its normal course?</p>
<p>This author believes the experiences in the market place would suggest that a
combination of these two issues is responsible. If we do not take the time to
understand and these issues, the TRIZ community will continue to be frustrated
in its attempts to commercialize a problem solving process which is known to be
an extremely valuable tool. Though the comments in this paper are generic in
nature and this author believes they apply to any form of the TRIZ methodology,
the experiences related in this paper have come primarily from running 3-day
problem solving sessions with Ideation TRIZ and the use of the Innovation
Workbench® software.</p>
<p>These are the issues and factors that must be considered in the process of
getting TRIZ accepted by its potential customers:</p>
<b>
</p><ol>
  <li>TRIZ must be considered as a new technology.</b> In the sense that any new
  technology presents a new way of solving problems, it is no less difficult to
  get people to accept TRIZ than it was the copier machine, desktop computers,
  cell phones, or other problem solving techniques such as QFD, Taguchi methods,
  Six Hats® and Lateral Thinking®, or Creative Problem Solving. If TRIZ
  advocates assume that there is something magical or different about TRIZ that
  makes it easier to accept and adopt, we are deceiving ourselves.</li>
<b>
<li>Any new technology has competition.</b> To assume that any competition is
going to instantly get out of the way and disappear is naïve. In the case of
new thinking and problem solving methodologies, the resistance is not always in
the form of price-cutting, hiring away key people, or the numerous other
activities that are sometimes seen in product competition. However, the
investment already made by organizations and individuals in those organizations
in other tools can be a significant barrier.</li>
<b>
<li>Everyone’s plate is very full</b> and nearly everyone is overcommitted in
time and resources. Learning anything new, whether it is TRIZ or any other new
tool, takes time. To ignore this simple fact and not have the patience to deal
with it will lead to frustration and commercial failure.</li>
<b>
<li>New technology adoption varies with organizations and within organizations</b>.
There have always been early adapters and late adapters in any industry, and in
any technology area. It is important to figure out who these people are and work
with them to accelerate the adaption process. The factors mentioned above are
still issues, but potentially less so. Technology adaption within organizations
also varies greatly. Much less frequently than 20 years ago, a senior leader in
an organization has a clear vision and decrees that a certain process and tool
will be used. This does not guarantee ultimate success, but it does get things
started. A far more likely scenario in today’s business world is that general
interest from a senior leader generates a search to find a volunteer and
champion who will try the new process and tool. Then the experience is shared
and slowly pollinates within the organization.</li>
<b>
<li>Learning and problem solving processes vary a great deal by individuals and
  by organizations.</b> It is important to know these different styles and how
they can affect the style in which TRIZ training and problem solving should be
done.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s take each of these issues and barriers one at a time and discuss
them.</p>
<b><u>
<p>TRIZ as a New Technology</p>
</u></b>
<p>People have been solving problems for thousands of years with many different
kinds of tools, processes, and techniques. It is hard for many people today to
believe that problems were solved without computers, but they were as little as
40 years ago. Most engineers and scientist have heard the story of the first
market projections for computer printers by HP as being no more than 500 per
year and carbon paper would live forever (has anyone even seen a sample of
carbon paper lately?). However, these transitions did not occur instantaneously
and without pain, despite the fact that in hindsight they were tremendous
inventions that we now find we must have.</p>
<p>In this particular case, what is it about TRIZ that is different? That might
make it difficult to accept? Let’s look at the fundamentals of the
methodology. First there is the concept of Ideality or Idea Final Result. Only
children can think this way easily. By the time engineers have graduated and
faced many jaw boning contradictions that they could not resolve, the concept
that there is value in dreaming and imagining a contradiction free situation is
very difficult, and to many, impractical and useless. The use of compromise as a
design philosophy is very strong! What can help here is examples and
illustration of where compromise has been overcome with TRIZ. Many corporate
clients obviously require confidentiality and these examples are hard to come
by. One role for the Altshuller Institute might be as a “storage” for
examples which clients have allowed to be shared. Most design engineers are, by
nature and by training, analogous thinkers, and anything that provides examples
helps tremendously. Case studies are a key to education and understanding,
especially case studies form the real world that our customers live in.</p>
<p>The second step in this process of acceptance is to get people to understand
that the need for compromise is driven by the existence of contradictions. Most
western engineers have lived with contradictions for years and it is their job
security! The fact that resolving a contradiction might eliminate a complicated
design in which an engineer has invested hundreds of hours of efforts can
actually seem to be job threatening rather than being a productivity
enhancement. TRIZ session leaders need to think ahead to a typical TRIZ problem
solving session, that lasts only 3 days, generating a breakthrough solution to a
problem that had generated a less than satisfactory solution and for which an
organization spent thousands of dollars and months of time. All TRIZ problem
solvers have seen TRIZ professionals salivate and run toward contradictions
because they know that is where the opportunity is. We must recognize that most
of our clients, seeing a contradiction, see bottles of extra-strength pain
relief pills. An effective technique here is to borrow from other creative
process techniques and get people to close their eyes and imagine the ideal
world without compromise. This kind of group thinking process is used regularly
in other types of creative sessions. After this exercise, one can encourage the
engineers and problem owners to imagine what their life would be like without
unresolved contradictions and design conflicts. Getting people to draw pictures
of ideality is also an effective technique because it can start the journey.
Another incentive is to get the engineers to think about what they could be
doing instead of what they are currently doing. Would they rather be working on
the next generation of a product or system, or fixing all the problems in the
current design? Would they rather be scaling up a new product or process, or
being called out on the midnight shift to fix something that never quite works
right? Positive incentives work far better than fear of job security in
motivating people to try new things, whether it is TRIZ or anything else.</p>
<b><u>
<p>Consider the Competition</p>
</u></b>
<p>We have all seen many pictures of “S” curves as representations of
systems’ evolution, growth, and eventual decline. Any mature industry or
technology that is not actively trying to reinvent itself fights back with a
vengeance. In the case of problem solving techniques, the resistance doesn’t
always come in the form of outright negativity, but from the simple fact that
thousands of dollars may have been spent training and institutionalizing a
process. And it helps to remember that these processes HAVE solved problems and
have a positive reputation. These existing problem-solving processes have, in
large corporations, utilized sometimes tens or hundreds of trainers and
thousands of dollars in training materials. Personal credibilities are
frequently at risk, especially when a senior executive has committed to a
program.</p>
<p>In the case of few or no existing problem solving tools (a rare case), the
challenge is far easier, but the demonstration of the uniqueness of the tool is
still required. The amount of inertia to overcome is also directly proportional
to the amount of money the potential user is expected to invest to try the new
tool.</p>
<p>One of the fatal mistakes that can be made is to attack these existing tools
as inferior or useless. It is far better to take the time to understand how the
existing tool is being used and then figure out how to complement and improve
it. Offering to run an inexpensive experiment for a potential user can also help
to overcome resistance. Collaboration rather than confrontation should be the
rule. Everyone attempting to sell TRIZ to a potential user needs to be able to
clearly state how TRIZ can improve and complement QFD, Creative Problem Solving,
Six Hats®, Lateral Thinking®, Taguchi methods, Six Sigma, and other tools.
There is no organization that is not using some or all of these tools. They will
not adopt TRIZ or any of its software embodiments without understanding how it
will complement or cost-effectively replace them.</p>
<p>Some TRIZ advocates draw a large TRIZ circle, and all other problem solving
tools around it, as if it were the center of the universe. This is not the way
to get TRIZ accepted. TRIZ advocates must recognize that there is value in many
of the tools and identifying the collaborative and complimentary space is the
best way to start.</p>
<b><u>
<p>The Plate is Full</p>
</u></b>
<p>Many times a potential user telling TRIZ advocates that their commitments are
overwhelming, and that they have no time to evaluate TRIZ, is discouraging.
Sometimes advocates hear about the new product launches that are underway. And
other times they hear about the massive investment being made in another problem
solving tool (Six Sigma is the latest), which brings up the competitive issue
discussed previously.</p>
<p>In this case, there are two approaches. Advocates can put potential users in
their tickler file and follow up when appropriate. This is frequently the right
approach, depending upon the situation. The second is to try to figure out how
TRIZ can help make the plate less full. This requires more patience than most
advocates normally have. It requires spending enough time with the customer to
understand what is overwhelming them and how they can be helped. Frequently,
getting the potential TRIZ users to express their frustrations in terms of
contradictions is a good place to start. Then the basic concept of TRIZ problem
solving can be brought up for discussion.</p>
<p>One of the other commentaries that is heard is that “we don’t need any
more ideas, we need to implement the ones we have.” TRIZ practitioners know
that the basic problem solving principles they use can be used in either
situation, but they too often narrow the application of the principles. One of
the most gratifying things that this user has seen in the past few years is the
application of the TRIZ principles to organizational and management issues. The
use of the Ideation TRIZ Problem Formulator® has been especially useful in this
regard.</p>
<p>All people who have run TRIZ problem-solving sessions know that the
discipline that they use in TRIZ to properly define the problem is the most
useful and important part of the methodology. They constantly see new awareness
develop after the correct kinds of problem definition questions have been asked.
The truly cost-impacting aspect of TRIZ can be in this phase. The amount of time
and money that organizations spend on solving the wrong or poorly defined
problem is incredible. This is the aspect of TRIZ that is most marketable to
groups with full plates, because every poorly defined problem is spending
valuable resources that can be better used elsewhere.</p>
<b><u>
<p>Technology Adoption</p>
</u></b>
<p>An organization adopting TRIZ is no different from an organization adopting
bar coding or laser video inspection. It is something different that changes the
status quo. There are whole companies and organizations that thrive on being the
first to adapt new technologies and leading their peers. Others prefer to see
others take the risk and invest later. They are taking the chance that the
expensive learning is more of a risk than the waiting. TRIZ advocates must
recognize that the use of TRIZ is a paradigm shift in how problems are both
analyzed and solved, and that everyone is not prepared to be a paradigm shifter.</p>
<p>It is usually easy to tell the difference in conversations with
representatives of organizations, or by reading the literature, patent filings,
talking to other consultants, etc.</p>
<p>Pairing up with rapid technology adopters is highly preferred.</p>
<p>If one looks at the adoption of certain types of quality and manufacturing
processes, it is seen that the top of the food chain drives them. If someone is
a supplier to the Ford Motor Co., and they do not choose to follow Ford’s
supplier requirements, they will not be a Ford supplier for long. Using TRIZ in
joint problem solving and product design sessions with supplier and customers in
the room together can be very powerful. This obviously requires a co-operative,
trusting relationship between the parties involved. The joint use of TRIZ could
greatly accelerate the adoption of TRIZ in a particular industry, especially if
the results were published.</p>
<b><u>
<p>Recognition of Different Learning Styles</p>
</u></b>
<p>In addition to differences in organizational adoption, there are distinct
differences in how individuals learn new things. At Idea Connections, we have
begun to use Michael Kirton’s KAI assessment tool as part of some of our
Ideation TRIZ sessions. This is a globally validated psychological assessment
tool that measures the style in which people solve problems. This instrument
measures an adaptive vs. innovative problem solving styles. Some individuals
think and solve problems in a more incremental way, requiring a stimulus to be
creative. Others are capable of ideation without stimulus or structure. Note
that we are talking about HOW people solve problems, not WHETHER they can solve
problems. We have found that this provides a framework for discussing the
analogic thinking process which is such an integral part of TRIZ, as well as
providing a framework for group discussions about different ways of thinking
about problems. TRIZ software products provide both stimulus and structure,
assisting both types of problem solving.</p>
<p>The important point here is to recognize that different people learn
differently and ignoring this important fact can make training and adoption of a
new tool like TRIZ a less than efficient process.</p>
<p>In figure 1 is shown a Problem Formulator® diagram from the Innovation
Workbench® software representing one view of the adoption of TRIZ problem
solving within an organization. One can readily see some of the conflicts
present by looking at function boxes with both red (negative “causes”
arrows) and green (positive “provides” arrows) coming out of them. These
would be the primary areas in which the problem solvers would typically focus.
These areas are:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Starting the TRIZ program</li>
  <li>Training sessions</li>
  <li>Solving difficult problems</li>
  <li>New problem definition approach</li>
  <li>Generation of an exhaustive solution list</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s look at each of these in conjunction with the idea list (see figure
2) generated by the Innovation Workbench® software:</p>
<b>
<p>Starting the TRIZ Program</p>
</b>
<p>If an organization already is overloaded with organizational programs, the
introduction of another one can frequently result in sabotage from key members
of the organization whose support is urgently needed. The idea list generated by
the IWB® software (statements 1-4, Figure 2) point toward the direction of
blending the introduction of TRIZ into broader, existing organizational
programs. If portions of TRIZ can be added into existing programs without
fanfare and their value demonstrated, the cost will be reduced and the
resistance will go down, while organizational support will increase.</p>
<b>
<p>Training Sessions</p>
</b>
<p>The idea list from the software (statements 36-39, figure 2) also point
toward the use of alternative ways to do TRIZ training that will improve
effectiveness, reduce time, and minimize meetings. The obvious thought here is
the Internet and non-meeting based training. There are downsides to this
approach in that students cannot learn from each other, but the speed and
flexibility of learning may more than make up for this negative factor. There is
some experience in this area with Semyon Semansky and Ideation International,
but published information about such experiences are rare, and the TRIZ
community will have to wait for additional organizational information to emerge.</p>
<b>
<p>Solving Difficult Problems</p>
</b>
<p>One of the most fascinating psychological observations, made by this author
in TRIZ session that he has run, is the reaction of experienced engineers to the
sudden realization that years of work, which had resulted in more and more
complicated engineering designs, was, in a matter of few days, made obsolete
through the use of the basic TRIZ principles of ideality, as well as the
identification of unrecognized resources. On occasion, this has resulted in
subtle forms of sabotage of the TRIZ generated ideas. The software directions
(statements 8-13, figure 2) suggest that enhancing the solutions to difficult
problems is a helpful direction. What could this mean? For one thing, management
should make it clear that long-standing problems standing in the way of
significant new organizational objectives need to be solved to allow new
opportunities to be attacked. It should be made clear at the start of a TRIZ
problem solving session that no one is going to be “punished” retroactively
for having one of their “pet” solutions be shown to be obsolete. It should
be made clear that adoption and support for a new breakthrough problem solving
technique is expected by all.</p>
<b>
<p>New Problem Definition Approach</p>
</b>
<p>The software suggestion of enhancing the new problem definition approach
(statements 6-8, figure 2) sounds simple, but it is one of the keys based on the
author’s experiences. No matter what problem solving approach is currently in
use, the problem definition will always take short shrift. Most engineers cannot
resist moving into the solution space, but history tells us that vast amounts of
money are spent solving the wrong or inadequately defined problems. Tools such
as the Problem Formulator® only add to this up front problem definition effort.
This author has yet to see a problem solving team not significantly redefine
their problem in the course of using this tool. The only way to deal with this
is for the advocate using TRIZ to explicitly state the upfront time required and
the value that will result. Experiences from other problem solving session can
also be shared. Providing a group the opportunity to share organizational
experiences with solving poorly defined problems can also help this process.</p>
<b>
<p>Exhaustive Solution Set List</p>
</b>
<p>One of the real assets of the TRIZ problem solving process is the generation
of a near-exhaustive solution set list. TRIZ practitioners recognize this as a
real positive aspect of the methodology, but many problem solving groups are
overwhelmed by the output of the process, especially with the use of software
such as the Innovation Workbench®. In working with a group, it is important for
the facilitator to make the point that the best solution can only be obtained by
making sure that all solutions have been considered. Management can reinforce
the point that committing millions of dollars to new projects can only be done
in confidence when all options have been considered. The other point that can be
made in the direction of “enhancing the exhaustive solution list” is to
recognize the value in such a list from the standpoint in intellectual property
strategy. Even if the organization cannot afford or chooses not to pursue all
directions, patent claims can be filed which may result in licensing revenue.
The handling of large idea lists can also he enhanced by sharing the evaluation
task among several individuals and groups. This not only spreads the workload,
but also provides the opportunity to obtain divergent idea inputs. Directions
relating to this area are in statements 32-35 in figure 2.</p>
<p>In summary, we must consider a large number of external factors and issues
when deciding how to approach different kinds of customers with out TRIZ tools.
Tailoring our approach and how we use our various tools can be the key to
successful implementation and sale of TRIZ software and consulting.</p>
