<p>Introduction</p>
</b>
<p>Organisations have been slowly acknowledging the significant role to be
played by knowledge as an essential part of their capital assets. Knowledge
management has been concerned with concepts of knowledge and communication as
important for how knowledge is managed. Some specialists have focused on IT as
the key to future developments. Others have critiqued this approach, not in
rejecting IT as such but in it being given prominence. Some of the arguments
have been based on the view that knowledge is qualitative as well as
quantitative and also that we need to take into account the creation of
knowledge as well as the storing of the known in data banks.</p>
<p>The concept of ‘knowledge management’ and the idea of functional
classification of scientific effects and solutions are of course central tenets
of the TRIZ methodology. The importance of such computer-based knowledge bases
and their ‘semantic web’ successors cannot be under-estimated. It is our
contention here, however, that they alone are not sufficient to ensure the
transformation of that knowledge into tangible benefit - in terms of either
problem solving or bottom-line business performance.</p>
<p>We do not reject computer modelling, of course, but emphasise the parallel
necessity for the kind of ‘soft modelling’ that involves human intuition and
sensory experience. We want to place this kind of soft modelling in a central
position. Not only is it humanising, it provides what we will be calling in this
article ‘molecules of meaning’ that can serve to relate qualitative
knowledge - or ‘feel’ - to ‘hard modelling’ systems, amongst other
features.</p>
<p>In general, not very much attention has been paid to the fact that the ‘medium’
in which knowledge is exchanged and organised deeply affects how that knowledge
is ultimately deployed. If we are to use knowledge to best effect, the question
of ‘medium’, therefore, needs to be addressed. This means that we have to
think about media in their own right and be prepared to learn new ways of
organising and manipulating knowledge.</p>
<p>We might think of our theme here in terms of the evolution of ‘knowledge’
from ‘data’:</p>
<p align="center">DATA </font><font face="Symbol">®</font><font face="Times New Roman">
INFORMATION </font><font face="Symbol">®</font><font face="Times New Roman">
KNOWLEDGE </font><font face="Symbol">®</font><font face="Times New Roman"> ‘WISDOM’
(1)</p>
<p>…and the steps that might now be required along a road from knowledge to a
contextualised, tangible, benefit-generating ‘wisdom’.</p>
<p>In this article, we look at a new approach to organising knowledge that
naturally encompasses knowledge creation and is also very close to the question
of thinking and <i>how</i> we think. We propose that how we think is
inextricably bound up with the medium we use to think <i>in</i>. A dilemma is
that having to think about how we think is bound to be felt as an additional
burden to the task of thinking itself. Applications are always specific, when
our attention is focused on what we want to do rather than on how we do it, and
the <i>how </i>recedes into the background. We have to spend much of this
article in defining and explaining the new medium of logovisual technology in
its own right, because we believe it throws light on how we can think and
organise knowledge.</p>
<p>Nonaka’s concepts of ‘ba’ and ‘interiorisation’ form a useful
background to what we have to say. ‘Ba’ is a ‘place of meeting’ in which
knowledge can be created, where the implicit becomes explicit and ‘basho’ is
a network of such ‘places’. ‘Interiorisation’ is the way by which such
knowledge becomes assimilated into us and the organisation as a whole. (2)</p>
<p>The new significant methodology we see emerging in recent times we name as
‘logovisual technology’ (LVT). It has two important features. The first is a
dimension of ‘tangibility’ and the second a way of handling knowledge in
terms of units that belong to a higher level than words, and constitute whole
‘molecules’ of meaning in their own right. In both features, we seek to
demonstrate consistency with TRIZ predicted trends of evolution. Thus in the
same way that ‘wisdom’ is a predictable evolution step from ‘knowledge’
from above, LVT may be seen as a demonstration of the TRIZ trend of evolution of
dimensionality from a simple/linear to complex/multi-dimensional system.</p>
<b>
<p>Tangibility</p>
</b>
<p>In recent years, in a movement headed by Robert Horn amongst others, the
concept of <i>visual thinking</i> has emerged as significant for human
understanding and communication. (3) We regard this as an important step in
moving from a purely linear and verbal way of representing knowledge - as in
written texts - to one that engages more of the whole person. We want to add a
further dimension and consider <i>tangibility</i> as equally as important as <i>visibility.</p>
</i>
<p>These concepts impinge on what we do with knowledge in all spheres of human
activity. Our own approach to what knowledge ‘is’ is pragmatic: knowledge is
anything we <i>can</i> think about. This means that ‘knowledge’ is part of
our human world, involving people and their relationships and is different from
the pure data that may be processed in the ‘black-box’ of computers in ways
that are not visible to us. Knowledge, for example, is what can enter
conversation. This includes the much-vaunted ‘tacit’ knowledge that we do
not usually voice but can, to some degree, when circumstances allow.</p>
<p>The concept of ‘tangibility’ refers to being able to handle and
manipulate knowledge, and not simply ‘see’ it. This concept introduces
something new from the recognition that pictorial, graphical and other means of
display, aid in representing and communicating knowledge. Studies have confirmed
the obvious - that ‘words + pictures’ fare better than words alone. As yet,
there have been no academic studies of the impact of tangibility, and we are
relying on experience to support our claim that tangibility should be
acknowledged as equally important.</p>
<p>In more specific terms, tangibility refers to two main factors that are
closely linked together:</p>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Knowledge is treated like an object</li>
  </font>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Knowledge can be moved about in physical
    space</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To consider knowledge as ‘thing-like’ may first appear strange. But it
  is no stranger than using words or pictures to represent knowledge. The <i>substantial</i>
  content of knowledge lies in the human world of minds, bodies and
  relationships. Somehow, we are able to use symbols to carry and transmit
  knowledge without entirely losing this substance. However, the substance does
  leak away unless it is renewed by some actual process in real time that
  engages the human being. That is why we are constantly having meetings and
  feel that documents by themselves, however sophisticated, lose something
  important of the substance of knowledge.</p>
  <p>The concept of tangibility tells us that knowledge needs to be handled in a
  ‘physical’ way if it is to be ‘alive’. We can store knowledge in all
  kinds of expert ways, but this does not make it real for the people who need
  it. It is common sense that, unless we actually <i>do something </i>with this
  knowledge, it becomes insubstantial for us or a mere record of what is passed.
  To some degree, conversation brings back the vitality of our knowledge; but we
  want to consider the aspect of tangibility in conjunction with that of
  visibility. In conversation alone, what is said can be alive in the moment but
  lost in the flow. We may see this as a manifestation of the mono-bi-poly trend
  - in which the form and application of knowledge evolves to better match our
  range of senses.</p>
  <p>A picture provides a wonderful way of representing knowledge in a
  meaningful way, but it is static. Animation can do something towards remedying
  this defect, but this is to entrust the tangibility factor to an external
  agent, whereas what is needed (and, incidentally, predicted via the
  dynamisation trend) is for this to be undertaken by the people involved.</p>
  <p>It is telling that the extraordinary concept map on the question of whether
  computers could simulate human intelligence produced by Horn and his workers
  took them years to make. (4) It is a wonderful piece of work. But the
  substance of the exercise was in the making of it and not so much in the
  viewing of it. Now that they have presented this piece of work, it is possible
  to consider how people can do something of the same for themselves with their
  own questions. <i><u>Doing it for ourselves</u></i> is making it tangible.
  This is because we have to handle knowledge and move it about <i><u>ourselves</u></i>,
  if we are to own and understand it.</p>
  <p>We are still, however, somewhat in thrall to ‘experts’, looking to them
  to organise our knowledge for us; and the thought of doing this for ourselves
  can be daunting. If we want to have ‘completeness’ then we face
  considerable difficulty. What we can do is to learn how to make knowledge <i>our
  own </i>by handling <i>some </i>of it. Once this has been done in some domain,
  the capacity is enough to affect all other domains. It is, in part, a matter
  of confidence. Learning how to organise knowledge in a tangible way about<i>
  something </i>develops a capacity that carries over into <i>everything</i>.
  The justification for this claim rests on the following considerations.</p>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Thinking is based on a physical process
    carried out in the brain</li>
  </font>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">We can simulate this process by a
    corresponding physical process in the external world</li>
  </font>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">We can then ‘interiorise’ this process</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There can be another intermediate step (between the second and the third)
  involving computer simulation, or any number of intermediate steps in this
  progressive cycle. The pattern here is ubiquitous in any sphere of human
  intelligence: we simulate the workings of our intelligence externally to
  enhance its operations internally. This is possible because ‘thinking’ is
  a cultural activity involving other minds and bodies in a real world of
  meaning. It is never confined to the interior of a brain.</p>
  <p>When we first develop a new mode of simulation, this often appears to the
  majority as ‘artificial’ and ‘alien’ to our customary experience and
  therefore of marginal interest, or to the specialist few as ‘superior’ to
  our customary ways and therefore liable to replace them in the long run. We
  simply point out whatever new technology we use has to become <i>part of our
  own bodies </i>if they are to be felt as ‘natural’.</p>
  <p>Usually, ‘thinking’ and ‘doing’ are considered as two separate
  things, but we want to observe that we are most <i>intelligent</i> when they
  fuse together (we will come again to the idea of intelligence later on). Much
  has been made of the need to combine the operations of the two sides of the
  brain, the one verbal and linear and the other pictorial and holistic. We
  advocate introducing a (mono-bi-poly) third kind of function, which is
  concerned with <i>doing</i> and requires a tangible kind of operation and
  represents a physical kind of thinking. (5)</p>

  </table>
  <p>We have invented a neologism, <i>logovisual technology</i> or LVT for
  short, to designate ‘making meaning visible in tangible form’. The use of
  the general word ‘meaning’ is needed because LVT deals with knowledge that
  is meaningful to the people who use it; that is to say, is relevant to them
  personally, their relationships, the work they do and the world in which they
  share. LVT signifies a step beyond <i>visual thinking </i>per se because it
  involves the activity of the participants and the tangibility factor.</p>
  <p>The three main characteristics of meaning in LVT are: discreteness,
  visibility and tangibility. The ‘size’ of its discrete or separate units
  of meaning is very important and we come to this later.</p>
  <p>LVT has a considerable pedigree. We can trace it back to Raymond Lull’s
  ‘technology’ of combining ideas, which was taken up in the seventeenth
  century by Leibniz, though in an abstract way. These two pioneers are often
  regarded as the forerunners of computer science but their work applies, we
  would say, more to LVT. In Renaissance times, there flowered something called
  the practice of the ‘art of memory’. (6) This, in fact, involved
  considerable feats of <i>visualisation</i>. In an attempt to encompass all
  classical knowledge, practitioners would visualise a house or theatre<i> </i>in
  which every part was associated with a piece of knowledge. As we shall discuss
  later, visualisation is an underlying feature of LVT. In the twentieth
  century, a not widely known method was developed, called <i>structural
  communication</i>, decades ahead of its time, which established the basic
  logic of LVT. (7) This evolved into a set of simple tools which are now to be
  found on the market and which are slowly coming into general use. References
  to these can now be found in the management literature. (8) However, the
  significance of these tools is largely overlooked because their origin has
  been forgotten and there are a variety of competing products, some of which
  have arisen independently.</p>
  <p>The basic premise of LVT is that meaning can be dealt with in discrete
  chunks. We like to call these chunks ‘molecules of meaning’. Each is a
  whole. The tangibility factor is that such chunks are embodied in a physical
  object that is capable of being moved in physical space (or as a virtual
  object in virtual space). In a sense, such ‘molecules’ (MMs for short) are
  analogous to a <i>human being</i> who is supposed to have both ‘body’ and
  ‘mind’ in such a way that they are intimately connected. Nearly always,
  the MM is composed of a statement written onto a flat object that can be
  attached - but not fixed - to a working surface. We can hold MMs in our hands.</p>

      <p>MMs are usually to be found in hexagonal shape, because this shape
      facilitates placing several together in a cluster. They are attached to a
      surface by means of adhesive or magnetism. The same shapes are found in
      computer applications. There are various names for these objects such as
      ‘idons’ or ‘magnotes’, or simply ‘hexies’ but we prefer the
      use of a more generic and non-proprietary name.</p>
      <p>Clusters of MMs can carry information by means of their shape or
      structure. Vertical and horizontal order can be made meaningful. Also, it
      is possible to depict different degrees of connection between MMs in a
      cluster, by placing them in touch or connected through other MMs.</font></td>

</font><font face="Times New Roman">
<p>Though it is easier to understand MMs if they are thought of just as written
statements, it is also the case that they can carry emotional as well as
conceptual information. This makes it possible for LVT to play a role in
therapeutic practices, many of which rely on expression of emotional content.
(9) This application is not entirely divorced from use in management work,
because ‘emotional overtones’ can be recognised as significant information
though embedded in ‘rational’ processes.</p>
<p>The next important aspect of LVT is that MMs can be combined together to make
new meanings. This is nothing but a reflection of the maxim ‘The whole is more
than the sum of its parts’. However, in LVT this truism, or holistic
assumption, is made tangible. MMs are combined together by positioning them on
the working surface so that they touch each other. What such a combination <i>means
</i>has to be seen and expressed. The combination of MMs becomes an MM in its
own right, though on a different level to the original ones. This way of
combination can continue as far we like, generating new meanings on different
levels.</p>

      <td><font face="Times New Roman"><b>METAPHOR</b>
        <p>LVT encourages and develops use of metaphor, and the term ‘molecule’
        as in MM is an obvious example. The ‘meanings on different levels’
        referred to can be taken as analogous to the scale of natural evolution.
        Thus, at a certain level, the corresponding type of MM becomes capable
        of self-replication and we have living systems. At the ‘top’ of the
        evolution of MMs is something equivalent to DNA. These are very powerful
        metaphors, not least because they connect LVT with wide-ranging insights
        from science and nature. We use the term ‘molecule of meaning’ to
        suggest that MMs can combine analogously to chemicals or living systems.
        MMMs are ‘macromolecules’ of extended combinations of MMs that can
        carry complex information. There are many different and equally useful
        metaphors we can use, for example that of music, where the MMs are ‘notes’
        and the combinations ‘chords’ or ‘phrases’. The metaphor of
        music is particularly useful in suggesting that there is underlying
        language of expression. It also exemplifies the important role of what
        is now being called ‘emotional intelligence’. (10) It is useful to
        work with guiding metaphors that we can <i>feel.</p>
        </i>
        <p>The ‘meanings on different levels’ concept is of course another
        important element of TRIZ thinking - where we are continually encouraged
        to change our perspective on a given situation by zooming in and out to,
        in TRIZ terminology, look at the super-system and sub-systems
        surrounding a defined system.</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>Combinations of MMs are usually referred to as ‘clusters’. Clusters can
be intuitive associations, in which we bring MMs together in an exploratory way
that relies more on feeling than concept. They can also be highly structured, in
that the <i>arrangement </i>of the MMs in relation to each other can carry
significant information.</p>
<p>We can <i>experiment </i>with different combinations and arrangements,
because the MMs are not fixed in position relative to the others. This simple
facility moves us a long way forward from using flip charts. The space of the
board (or computer ‘window’) on which MMs are displayed can be used to
depict distributions of MMs according to grids and/or different axes of meaning.
Clusters can themselves be clustered at several</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#00ff00">
</font><font face="Times New Roman">levels. The different levels can be shown on
different boards or windows, linked together. Each significant cluster of MMs
becomes an MM on another level.</p>
<p>The simplest form of LVT is by having small cards to write on that can be
pinned to a board and then moved around to make different combinations. More
sophisticated implementations use computer software, where the tangibility is
provided through the ‘mouse’. The computer format is necessary to make
complete records and produce reference documentation. The more concretely
tangible forms using real objects can be very effective in creative sessions.
Creativity flourishes when our physical, emotional and intellectual faculties
are <i>all</i> engaged.</p>
<p>The recent appearance of a ‘spiritual intelligence’ in the literature is
also significant because this is based on our direct sense of meaning. (11)
Creativity is relevant to knowledge, not least because of Nonaka’s insistence
on <i>knowledge creation </i>above <i>knowledge management. </i>These two
concepts reflect the difference between <i>organisation</i> and <i>order</i>.</p>
<b>
<p>Order and Organisation</p>
</b>
<p>We use these two words in a specific way. ‘Order’ refers to any fixed
arrangement and its archetype is a crystal where every atom is in its place and
does not move. ‘Organisation’ refers to a pattern that embraces uncertainty
and change, and its archetype is a living being or an ecology in which ‘atoms’
are in constant flux. We can note that still, to a surprisingly large extent,
organisations such as companies are looked at through the lens of order and
considered as being fixed, rather like a machine or thing.</p>
<p>In LVT we combine meanings to make new meanings. The ‘hands’ put pieces
of knowledge together to make a new totality that shows something new to the ‘brains’.
The emergence of new meanings is critical in organising knowledge (as opposed to
putting it in order) because ‘newness’ is an essential part of meaning. The
‘eureka’ sense of discovery and insight is not some luxury but essential to
having meaningful knowledge. Whenever someone works with knowledge in a
meaningful way, what it ‘is’ changes. This is the substance out of which the
‘learning organisation’ may one day come to be made in reality and not just
in concept.</p>
<p>The basic action takes place in the generation, assembly and ‘reading’ of
a combination of MMs. We can put some MMs together but we then have to make
sense of their combination or ‘read’ them. As we assemble a combination that
we feel to be significant, we are drawing on knowledge that is <i>implicit. </i>We
can feel that these MMs belong together but we cannot yet say why. When we ‘read’
them, we are becoming conscious of what was previously only implicit and the
implicit transforms into the <i>explicit</i> as we give a name and description
to the complex or ‘cluster’.</p>
<p>This follows the general case in which we can make selections and ‘choose
amongst’ according to rules that are not themselves known in their own right.
The phrase ‘choose amongst’ is a literal rendering of the meaning of the
word <i>intelligence. </i>Intelligence involves implicit knowledge and that is
why it hard to communicate it. However, through LVT we can see intelligence at
work: it is rendered visible and tangible. LVT provides a means of experimenting
and sharing with others in the transformation of implicit into explicit
knowledge. It is a method of organisation rather than order.</p>
<b>
<p>Multiple Perspectives</p>
</b>
<p>‘Reading’ a cluster of MMs is to be able to see it as a whole and has
very strong parallels with the TRIZ ‘multi-screen’ approach. The word ‘seeing’
is used here in two senses and refers to both understanding with the mind and
seeing with the eyes. We make the assumption that when we ‘see’ this is from
a certain point of view, or perspective. It is not some absolute God-given
access to reality. We may not know what our point of view is because it is
implicit in our judgements of what makes sense. When different people are
involved, they may each see a different meaning. This is nearly always the case,
but it is largely obscured because of the prevailing belief that there is only
one ‘good’ or ‘logical’ way of organising knowledge. A consequence of
this is that most groups work unconsciously towards consensus and marginalise
differences. Because, in most ways of dealing with knowledge, one can have only
one way of putting it in order, this dictates consensus. As a result a great
deal of meaningful knowledge is lost to view.</p>
<p>Having multiple perspectives does not have to mean chaos - if the differences
are made explicit. We can allow several people to make different
interpretations, just as long as these are looked into to derive the <i>organising
ideas</i> that underlie them. In the case of a group today, working with LVT,
everyone in the group uses the same set of MMs as each other, so they have a <i>common
language. </i>If they see the situation differently, they will organise the MMs
differently. This will be visible to all. They are then in a position to explain
to each other what they mean by their choices ‘amongst’.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the usual discussion without LVT, what is expressed is
similar to what is implied in making a cluster: it is an expression of points of
view. This does not enable people <i>to see</i> what lies behind these views and
how they are reflected in the given case. But, in LVT, everyone involved uses
the same underlying language - the MMs - and can <i>show</i> what they mean by
the selections they make.</p>
<p>There are many management theories, which propose that there are <i>four </i>distinct
perspectives that can be adopted in relation to any given problem or aim. It is
easily possible for people to map MMs according to these four types. It is
equally possible for a group to evolve its own version of four perspectives, or
any other number they want to work with. Such quaternaries are organising ideas.
They, or some equivalent, are always in play whether they are part of a
conscious theory or mere personal inclination.</p>

      <td><font face="Times New Roman"><b>STRUCTURAL COMMUNICATION</b>
        <p>Structural communication was first devised for application to
        education. In the original technique, a set of questions, representing
        different perspectives, was applied to a given set of MMs. (The MMs were
        arranged in a static grid, in contrast with the present LVT use of
        randomly displayed hexagons.) Each question would attract a different
        set of MMs relevant to itself. It was assumed that these different sets
        would overlap. By working through the questions, we would come to view
        the MMs from multiple perspectives. The power in this was that the given
        set of MMs was the same for each of the questions and we had to decide
        which were relevant and which were not from the perspective of each of
        the questions, which would be different in each case. The formation and
        use of a set of questions is exactly the same as having a set of
        different perspectives. The sets of questions were the equivalent of, or
        a step towards, organising ideas.</p>
        <p>Compiling and structuring teaching material in this form proved
        arduous, demanding deep understanding of the subject on the part of the
        author and familiarity with multiple points of view. Only later was it
        realised that it was far better for people to do this work for
        themselves. In this way, they could take part in the <i>organisation </i>of
        knowledge.</font></td>

<b>
<p>The Ground State of LVT</p>
</b>
<p>We need to emphasise the supreme importance of working from a base of MMs, or
‘molecules of meaning’. These MMs need to be all on the same level and
capable of being combined with any other, at least in principle. The
combinations we pick out are those that come most easily to mind, or make most
evident sense to us. This system always operates in terms of what is most
meaningful to those that use it. It does not impose any set framework.</p>
<p>Generating and gathering the MMs is an important process. This process
includes attention being paid to ensuring that everyone involved understands
what each MM means and accepts it as part of the total picture. It also requires
a <i>suspension of judgement</i>. For example, if there is a case study, the MMs
would consist of the <i>facts </i>of the situation and not involve any
interpretation. What the facts are is not cut and dried and some kind of
assessment of relevance must be made. The factual MMs should at first glance be
of equal status; in that we have suspended judgement on which are the most
critical for the diagnosis. (12)</p>
<p>The assemblage of relevant MMs should not have any order. This allows for an
open field of possible combinations between them, without prejudice. A great
deal of knowledge can be assembled and displayed. Relative to the given task,
anything between 20 and 100 MMs may be appropriate. The large number taxes
attention span, but the guiding rule of thumb is that all relevant information
should be displayed on the same surface. Quite automatically, people scan the
field of information ‘at random’ as the brain searches for connections. It
is, therefore, an energising process in which mental routine programming is
unfrozen.</p>

        <p>The brain ‘seeking for connections’ is a reference to <i>heuristics</i>.
        We are assuming that LVT makes use of what we have already as organic
        beings, which has evolved in us into search programmes for making
        meaning. Any suspension or interruption of routinised
        meaning-recognition stimulates our heuristic capabilities, which come
        into play pre-consciously. In LVT, we also supply significant data - the

<p>A free space is needed on which to display combinations. With a relatively
small number of MMs - around 20 - the MMs can be first placed around the
periphery of the display board and afterwards moved into the centre region in
clusters.</p>

<p>This process is a simulation of embracing a large quantity of information
within a single mental embrace, which ordinarily requires a power of
concentration that is exceedingly hard to reach and maintain. By having the work
supported through external display, it is made much more accessible. Further, by
having the space of combination in the same field as the randomly assembled MMs,
but in a separate part, the thinking involved in making these combinations does
not obscure the background of knowledge. Building the clusters is akin to
passing through the flat display of the MMs to arrangement in depth. Each
cluster constitutes an added ‘dimension’ in its own right.</p>

        computing science away from electronic digital processing towards
        physical organic means. A ‘flask’ of molecules is used, in which
        molecules are allowed to seek out viable combinations, out of which can
        be selected or ‘distilled’ meaningful solutions to problems. This is

<p>Hence the ground state of LVT, which is the random array of MMs on a flat
bounded surface, represents a powerful potential. By suspending judgement, a
creative step is made more possible. Creative potential is represented by the
blank surface behind and between the MMs. Complexity is in the large number of
MMs, while simplicity is in each MM. By simple iterative steps of movement,
separation and combination, the material is open to undergoing what is now
generally called <i>self-organisation. </i>In TRIZ terms again, this MM
manipulation process is seen to offer direct means of recognising the different
hierarchical layers of a problem or situation, and tangibly ‘managing
complexity’.</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Networking and the Role of MMs</p>
</b>
<p>Handling knowledge in discrete units of meaning provides many advantages. One
of these is that we can form links between different knowledge domains.
Contemporary software makes it possible for every MM to be linked with
associated text, databases, web sites and email addresses, as well with hard
modelling and higher order models of knowledge. The importance of this is that
great amounts of recorded knowledge can be made meaningful by relating it to
holistic displays <i>through MMs</i>. Such displays can be enriched with
metaphors, myths and images that carry emotional intelligence in a way that is
now being advocated by many consultants. Very complex fields of knowledge can be
made accessible by LVT because they are centred on visual organisation and tap
into our natural capacities to visualise wholes.</p>
<p>The simple application of LVT is restricted to a given domain of concern, or
a particular <i>ba</i> (to use Nonaka’s term) such as a current problem facing
an organisation, and a particular group. It is early days yet to claim that this
can be extended into the deliberate formation of living networks of knowledge
across a whole organisation.</p>
<p>The localised application is modelled in an exercise by Liz Borreden of EDHEC,
based in Lille, France. This was an academic exercise but it makes the
principles clear. She took as her source a book on mentoring (13). From one case
study in the book, she distilled a set of MMs. She then organised these into
different clusters, expressing the themes of each cluster. These themes then
became MMs in their own right, which were then incorporated with other MMs from
other case studies. By a combination of distillation and incorporation, the
process continued to arrive at a triad of factors. In all, about 70 MMs were
involved. The beauty of this approach is that her final model can be traced back
to its sources in particular ideas and these, in their turn can point to the
actual texts from which they were derived. In the diagram (fig. 1) we show in a
symbolic way the texts, MMs, clusters and model (in this case, a triad).</p>
<p align="center"><img border="1" src="02.gif" width="597" height="244"><br>
<br>
<b>Figure 1. Hierarchy of Meaningful Knowledge</b></p>
<i>
<p>All </i>the MMs are contained in the final model, so that the abstraction
does not lose connection with its genesis. But, even more importantly, if
another text was dealt with in the same way, there would be MMs that are the <i>same
</i>for both texts, because they refer to the same subject. Given two such
treatments, it would be possible to cross over from one to the other. Such would
begin to constitute a <i>network.</p>
</i>
<p>At present, without LVT, cross-referencing is done through references (such
as those at the end of this article) and direct quotation. What links the
reference - say to an article or book - and the quotation is really what we are
calling an MM. Only, we never get to <i>see </i>the whole array of relevant MMs
except in our own minds. We believe that what is currently just in our ‘private’
minds will become accessible in the future in ‘public’ displays.</p>
<p>On the Internet, there is considerable frustration over accessing relevant
knowledge - even with the burden-reducing capabilities offered by new generation
semantic processors - because this is done through <i>words </i>and not through
the stronger meanings of MMs.</p>
<p>The selection of ‘chunks’ of meaning then appears as extremely important.
Our argument is that doing work on generating such MMs will greatly facilitate
the organisation of knowledge. In the case of Liz Borredon’s exercise, she
used MMs such as “understand process to develop unfragmented person”. This
can be understood as the <i>distillation of a whole paragraph</i> in a book and
illustrates the level at which MMs exist.</p>
<p>Though the exercise we described was conducted from a written text, there is
no reason why the same approach should not be applied to any source material. An
organisation itself can be treated as a text, even though there would have to be
considerable processing to render it into verbal material. LVT is being used in
such areas as scenario planning and problem solving where there is some kind of
focus of interest into a topic.</p>

    <tr>
      <td><font face="Times New Roman"><b>SEMANTIC ATOMS</b>
        <p>When we work from relatively raw experience, we have to make use of
        semantics that we take for granted. In other words, we have to start to
        render our experience explicit through our vocabulary. This vocabulary
        concerns what we may think of as the ‘atoms’ out of which our
        molecules of meaning are constructed. We draw attention to this because
        what we call the ‘ground state’ of LVT is already a considerable
        achievement. However, in rendering our experience articulate, we can
        retain feelings and intuitions that feed into the various stages of
        expression and insight. What is ‘left out’ of the verbal expressions
        we arrive at can come into effect in how we organise the MMs into
        clusters and clusters of clusters.</font></td>

  </table>

</div>
<p>It is necessary to emphasise that the process whereby we move from MMs to our
top model is not one of generalisation, nor is it the same as the TRIZ view of
abstraction. In LVT, there is no automatic mechanism for shifting between
hierarchical layers, because at each transition there has to be a corresponding
generation of meaning (or, in Nonaka’s terms ‘creation of knowledge’). It
is recognised in science, for example, that empirical data of itself cannot
result in hypotheses or theories. Hypotheses and theories require specific acts
of thought. In LVT, the equivalent of ‘empirical data’ is the MMs, of
hypotheses, the meaning of clusters and of theory the top model. We expand on
this picture in figure 2.</p>

        </b>
        <p>This is a bare schemata for the organisation of knowledge. It is a
        useful analogy to consider the various levels from bottom to top as
        representing different numbers of dimensions. Hence, ‘experience’ is
        akin to a 1-dimensional line, MMs exist in 2-dimensional planes,
        perspectives are 3-dimensional and organising ideas, 4-dimensional. The
        figure shows more than one plane of MMs, to suggest cross-linkages. The
        cube representing perspectives is exemplified by such models as Albert
        Low’s: Simple, Complete, Pragmatic and Communicable; or McWhinney’s:
        Unitary, Sensory, Mythic and Social. (14) Both schemes are typical in
        addressing the question of the basic structure of multiple views of
        reality. Awareness of perspectives is an integral part of the culture of
        the organisation, which is a mixture of both perspectives and reflection
        on them in awareness. The organising idea is the theory of the
        organisation that gives direction to meaningful change. (15) The word is
        not used here to refer to general theories of organisation, though an
        example would be ‘the learning organisation’.<i></i></font></td>

<b>
<p>Visualisation</p>
</b>
<p>Nonaka advocates a ‘middle-top-down’ process for knowledge
creation/management. This is very much paralleled by the approach embodied in
LVT. The ‘middle’ in this case is ascribed to MMs, which are already
considerable distillations of meaning in their own right, representing critical
ideas or factors in a complex and changing situation as much as they can
represent such factors in a static text. The ‘top’ is ascribed to the
ultimate models (such as the triad in Liz Borredon’s exercise), which
represent basic organising ideas, including the idea of ‘theory’ as put
forward by commentators introducing complexity theory. (15) The bottom is
ascribed to the source material, which usually comes in a rough and ready way,
because it is being distilled out of the raw experience of organisational
actions. At every level and in every step, there is an opportunity for
creativity in step with <i>order. </i>Order comes into play - as Kurt Lewin
might have said - whenever the system of knowledge is frozen in a specific
state. Creativity comes in when this order is unfrozen allowing for movement and
learning. This would include allowing people to handle the knowledge, which
means that they would have to have the tools for doing so.</p>
<p>If we had to rely on setting up an explicit system of knowledge to apply to
all aspects of an organisation, we would be facing an impossible challenge. Even
if we had the resources, by the time it was near complete, it would already be
outmoded. The resolution of this dilemma relies on accepting the relativity of
knowledge and the process of interiorisation.</p>
<p>The relativity of knowledge stems from the basic complementarity of the
implicit and the explicit. It is impossible, in principle, to make all implicit
knowledge explicit. There will always be something left out of the explicit that
will prove important at some time. We just do what we can to make ourselves
alert to surprises in the future.</p>
<p>This alertness stems from interiorisation. The use of a medium of thinking <i>changes
what thinking is. </i>There is not a ‘set of tools’ on the one hand and ‘users’
on the other. As is surely obvious from the last century, technology changes us
as much as we make it what it is. We mentioned from time to time the power of <i>visualisation.
</i>This power is still almost entirely neglected in current educational
practice so that people entering into professional life do not have it much
developed. It is all important in being to see the wood for the trees and to
create good designs. We propose that the power of visualisation can be enhanced
and developed by LVT and results from an interiorisation of what we do with
knowledge in a tangible way .</p>
<p>We have moved from consideration of a technology to consideration of a human
power. This is because we believe that the quest for the organisation of
knowledge <i>must </i>base itself on human capacity because knowledge needs to
be organised for people and not in spite of them. It is of little value if
knowledge is organised (or ordered, rather) in such a way that people cannot <i>feel
</i>that it is theirs. They need to be able to <i>see</i> the organisation for
themselves. This seeing, or visualisation, must be rooted in <i>tangibility</i>.
This is how we are made.</p>
<p>If we are able to foster the organisation of knowledge in <i>some </i>areas,
then this can influence a great many areas. The approach of organisation does
not aim at mechanical completeness but bases itself on having starting points
from which networks can build. Such networks can be built on MMs instead of
words. This means that every level is intelligible in its own right and pathways
of meaning can be discovered connecting every local space of knowledge with
every other.</p>
<p>Current developments in LVT software are focused on groupware, making it
possible for several people to operate in the same space. With this development,
computerisation will provide a complete simulation of the physical-social
interaction of using solid objects, allied with facility for networking in real
time.</p>

        <p>The way in which networking works has been described in the ‘small

        elements (e.g. people) can be effectively connected together when it is
        in practice, due to the limitations of space-time, impossible for every
        single element to be linked with every other element. It is proposed
        that elements cluster together in distinguishable groups but, in each
        group, there are a few elements which are also directly linked with
        elements in other groups. Such apparently few connections can actually
        serve to connect the totality of clusters as a whole system. (16)</font></td>

<b>
<p>The Haptic Factor</p>
</b>
<p>It is therefore more than interesting that some developments in computer
technology concern the amplified use of tangibility. For example, research is
being done on ‘handling molecules’ (that is, chemical ones) by means of
virtual reality gloves into which can be introduced sensations of resistance,
attraction, etc. (17) Other developments are looking into making the ‘objects’
on the screen auditory. It is being seen that the more physical and sensation
based the operations, the more they engage our sense of reality and the greater
our effectiveness. This we refer to as the <i>haptic </i>factor, ‘haptics’
being the branch of psychology that deals with sensory data through the skin and
the sense of touch.</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1" width="90%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
    <tr>
      <td><font face="Times New Roman"><b>HAPTIC</b>
        <p>Haptic derives from the Greek <i>haptesthai</i>, which means to
        touch. In the broader sense it also includes the sense of one’s body
        in ‘internal touch’ or the proprietoceptive sense that Bohm refers
        to. (5) The internal dynamic of our skeleton, muscles, tendons, etc.
        connects into the external world of solid objects and forces. In its
        most strongly relevant sense to our theme it refers to the sense by
        which we ‘gasp’ what something is. We use this word ‘grasp’ to
        indicate not only clasping something but also <i>understanding </i>it.</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>Though such developments take far longer to come into general use than their
enthusiasts tend to assume, the trend is there. Such concrete and qualitative
aspects of handling knowledge are usually neglected in management circles
because they smack too much of ‘play’ - after all this is what our kids like
doing so it can’t be serious - and also because of the historical inertia of
treating knowledge in purely conceptual terms, without emotion or sensation.</p>
<p>Though we have presented MMs in terms of written statements on objects, we
can look forward to them being genuine objects in their right (i.e. their
dimensionality will evolve). All that is now treated in terms of ‘environmental
design’ will come to be considered as an aspect of LVT. LVT is simply the
movement and arrangement of meaningful objects. And it does not matter <i>what </i>kind
of object this is, just so long as we can ‘handle’ it. In this sense, it is
not wildly irrelevant to mention such things as Megalithic architecture as an
LVT device.</p>
<p>It must be a truism to state that at present management and technical
language has become so abstracted from concrete experience that it is proving a
barrier to the active participation of human beings in what they are managing.
LVT is emerging as an almost instinctive corrective.</p>
<b>
<p>Summary</p>
</b><i>
<p>The human criterion. </i>We emphasise the reflection of the whole person in
the combination of the conceptual, the visible and the tangible embodied in LVT.
This naturally includes emotional and spiritual intelligence, but intelligence
in general we see as rooted in the fusion of hands and brains. LVT is an
appropriate tool for the organisation of knowledge. It is strongly based on the
humanisation of systems of thought, which must allow for creativity and change.</p>
<i>
<p>Development of meaning. </i>Powerful as some of the TRIZ knowledge bases are
becoming, they offer little by way of meaning or context to some users. For
example, it is one thing to know that there are 44 ways to achieve the function
‘move a liquid’, another to know which is the most appropriate to a
particular application, and another again to transfer whichever scientific
effect the researcher has chosen into a proven solution. Having the knowledge is
a massive leap forward in capability, but it is someway away from ‘the answer.’</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0000">
</font><font face="Times New Roman">LVT recognises and tries to bridge the gap
between ‘knowledge’ and organisation and use of that knowledge. LVT however
recognises that it can never lead to a ‘complete’ system of knowledge,
because substantial knowledge must always be in process of renewal and creation.
Practice of it develops the power of visualisation, or seeing wholes; and it
also sets in motion the formation of networks of meaning, which can link with
‘hard modelling’. The facility that LVT offers stems from it being rooted in
‘molecules’ of meaning rather than in words or documents per se.</p>
<i>
<p>Middle-top-down. </i>The Nonaka prescription for involvement of management
levels is paralleled by the basing of LVT on MMs (representing the ‘middle’).
Movement towards the top is done by clustering or combining MMs into meaningful
new wholes. These wholes are then sides or dimensions of the governing set of
perspectives, which need to relate to a top organising idea. It is from the
realm of ideas and perspectives that organisation flows down to the processes of
generating MMs in the first place.</p>
<i>
<p>Logotechnology. </i>In general, technologies based on meaning are not fixed
to any set of tools or systems. LVT can operate with pencil and paper as well as
with computer software and laptops. It is the involvement of people in using
this new medium of thinking that can make all the difference in the way that
knowledge is organised. The opportunity that non-computer forms of LVT give for
people to walk around, move objects and talk, grounds knowledge organisation in
the human world.</p>
<i>
<p>The haptic factor: </i>LVT is based on tangibility, and as people move away
from keyboard and mouse as their interface, the physical aspect of knowledge
will come to the fore in an even more powerful way.</p>
<i>
<p>LVT. </i>‘Logovisual technology’ is our name for any process that
embodies the three factors that can be summarised in our ‘top model’, the
triad: Meaning-Seeing-Moving</p>
<i>
<p>The road to ‘wisdom’. </i>TRIZ allows users unprecedented access to the
world’s knowledge. The road to benefit producing ‘wisdom’ means learning
how to place knowledge in a context and make it tangible.</p>
