<p>Semyon D. Savranskys new book Engineering of Creativity (Boca Raton 2000. CRC
Press) covers in its 19 chapters and nearly 400 pages many concepts and tools of
TRIZ. Instead to write a comprehensive review I rather would like to concentrate
attention to a few points that I consider most important.</p>
<p>Let´s make first three quotations from the book:</p>
<p>Third page of the preface: “It is impossible to use TRIZ effectively
without firmly understanding its concepts; therefore, the reader should not jump
directly to the final part of this book.”</p>
<p>Page 23: “The concepts of Contradiction, Evolution, Resources, and Ideal
Solution are the main building blocks of TRIZ…”</p>
<p>P. 27: “It is impossible to solve high degree of difficulty problems with
only the knowledge of TRIZ heuristics and instruments without learning the whole
TRIZ methodology and sharpening solver skills with real and educational
problems.”</p>
<p>I would like to write with bold capital letters the words:</p>
<b>
<p>“IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO USE TRIZ EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT FIRMLY UNDERSTANDING ITS
CONCEPTS…”</p>
</b>
<p>The statement is more important than it may seem at first glance. We have
accumulated in Finland much experience on the problem “concepts vs. heuristics
and instruments”. In 1980s were conducted many workshops, usually of 5 days
total in class-room, plus home-work. The main content of these workshops was
ARIZ. Su-Field models were another important item. Concepts of contradiction,
resources, ideal final result and patterns of evolution were considered shortly,
as an introduction to main topics. Clearly the most important were “heuristics
and instruments”, concepts followed in second order. One should add that at
that time abbreviations TRIZ - a theory, and ARIZ - a step-by-step guide, were
often used nearly as synonyms.</p>
<p>In winter 1999-2000 I interviewed participants of these courses I have
conducted more than 10 years ago. I asked which things from the contents of the
courses they have used. The answers were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Most useful and most often used were the models of contradiction,
          ideal solution and resources</p>
          <p>Some participants named patterns of evolution as important and
          useful tools</p>
          <p>No one used ARIZ</p>
          <p>Su-Field drawings were rejected, they gave clearly negative
          feed-back</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The result was rather surprising, compared with common views on training in
industry. Engineers, practical people by heart, clearly preferred theoretical
and scientific concepts to ready “heuristics and instruments”. The
participants who had internalized some kind a scheme “contradiction -
resources - ideal final result”, had got best results.</p>
<p>This surprise got a convincing explanation when we analyzed results using the
achievements of Activity Theory (AT). AT is a disciple studying human activity.
One of findings of this school is that people need compact models, visions, or
orienting bases, to understand, use, evaluate, develop and apply any subject
matter.</p>
<p>Experience on 1990s, for example attempts to “go to TRIZ” via TRIZ-based
software or Altshullers matrix, only confirmed above mentioned results. Both
customer feedback and theory implicated the same conclusions. It became
necessary to turn the subject matter of TRIZ upside down so that a basic
theoretical model took clearly the first place before different tools,
step-by-step guides and job plans. A totally new TRIZ workshop was developed and
successfully tested in the beginning of the year 2000. A new textbook, exercise
book and teachers guide were written.</p>
<p>After this work I got Savranskys book. I saw that the book reflects the same
trend: more emphasis on the basic concepts. Chapter 2 gives TRIZ Overview, and
chapter 3 considers the technical system. Contradictions, Ideality,
Substance-Field Resources, Evolution of Technique are studied in chapters 4-7.
After that follows detailed information of different tools and heuristics.</p>
<p>The structure of the book may seem self-evident hindsight, but the comparison
with earlier literature shows the rather long and sometimes painful change. In
Altshullers most famous book - Creativity as an Exact Science - are chapters
like “Principles of S-Field Analysis”, “Tactics of Invention”, “Talented
thought”, “Forty Basic Methods”, and others. Contradictions and other
basic concepts are considered in sub-chapters and numerous remarks all over the
book. The last book of Altshuller on TRIZ, “To Find an Idea” (not published
in English), contains chapters of evolution patterns and ideality, after the
critics of other methodologies, the study of different system levels,
nine-screen model and other items. His work in general contains much -
historically inevitable - “carelessness of genius”. Central and most
valuable things are often buried under numerous ideas, themes and lines of
research.</p>
<p>That´s why Altshullers books don´t give a general initial model of TRIZ.
Using the jargon of cognitive psychology, they, and literature on TRIZ
generally, lack an orienting basis.</p>
<p>Savransky´s book helps to dig up the kernel of the theory from the vast
amount of information.</p>
<p>These statements contain, inevitably, some simplification. The emphasis on
the three or four basic concepts does not at all mean, that different heuristics
and step-by-step guides are useless. It means only, that you should begin from
basic concepts. For example, if the book is used as a practical guide, it may be
best first to model contradictions, ideal final result, resources, and paths of
evolution using only the recommendations in chapters 4-7. Then the solution can
be enriched and improved using heuristics in the part 5 of the book. To begin
from step-by-step guides, for example, from the contradiction matrix (chapter
13), is not the best practice.</p>
<p>For some seasoned TRIZ experts the transition of emphasis from immediate
recommendations to theory may be not very interesting since they have always
thought and worked this way. More and more people, however, will use TRIZ, and
teach it, too. I am sure, that for many of them clear presentation of the core
of TRIZ will be useful.</p>
