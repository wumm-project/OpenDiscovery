<p><b>The Dialectic Paradox or The Resolution of Opposites</b></p>
<p>The philosophy of the &quot;Tao&quot; or the &quot;Way&quot;, was set down in
approximately 600 B.C. by Lao Tzu in 81 poems, entitled &quot;The Tao Teh Ching&quot;.
The Tao poems contain a philosophy of life that has lasted through the centuries
and they have been retranslated as well as rewritten many times. They contain
many ideas which are relevant in the area of creativity: &quot;being in the
moment&quot;, &quot;effortless action&quot;, &quot;enjoying the journey&quot;,
&quot;the importance of nothingness&quot;, &quot;listening to your own inner
way&quot;, and the &quot;integration of opposites&quot;. The last idea, the
&quot;Integration of Opposites&quot; [TRIZ: the &quot;Resolution of
Contradictions&quot;], will be explored in this article through an exercise, the
Dialectic Paradox, which you can experience and use to solve problems or gain
new insights into issues. The following is one of the Tao poems that talks about
the importance of Opposites:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tao #2</p>
<p align="center">People finding one thing beautiful,<br>
Think another unbeautiful,<br>
Finding one creation sound,<br>
They judge another unsound.<br>
Yet, creation and destruction,<br>
Difficult and easy,<br>
High and low,<br>
All arise from each other.<br>
Since something and nothing<br>
Give birth to one another,<br>
Offer texture to a life,<br>
And nourish the imagination,<br>
A creative person accepts no rules,<br>
And knows that opposites,<br>
Are part of the whole.<br>
Accepting everything as it is,<br>
The let it come and go,<br>
As something to participate in,<br>
Yet not to dominate,<br>
To nourish, yet not to possess.<br>
In union with what is,<br>
They give birth freely,<br>
Without claiming authority,<br>
For creativity is all around,<br>
And within us all.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">(From the book &quot;Tao of Creativity&quot;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This poem reflects the idea that opposites enrich and contribute to one
another [TRIZ: &quot;No contradiction … No invention&quot;], &quot;varying
tones makes music&quot;, and are not something to be avoided or removed. In the
integration of opposites we &quot;accept everything as it is&quot; and don’t
make judgments or rules that something should be one way and not the other
[TRIZ: Principle #1 Segmentation and/or #5 Merging both could be useful separate
or together - examples: Micro-chip and Fax machine that is a Fax, a printer and
copier].</p>
<p>When applied to creativity the importance of opposites resonates with
Einstein’s idea that &quot;the answer is within the problem&quot;. The concept
that the problem itself may be a part of the solution is an important part of
the Tao [an importance in TRIZ - Problem Identification, Su Field analysis
etc.]. An exercise called the Dialectic Paradox is one way of trying this
concept out on an issue or problem that you would like to solve. It involves the
Resolution of Opposites (Dialectic means opposites and Paradox, the resolution)
and uses the negative side of the problem to come up with new perspectives. It
reflects the idea that creativity is wholistic, not necessarily dualistic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;The Dialectic Paradox&quot; - Exercise:<br>
(From the book &quot;Creative Genius&quot;)</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Put a problem or issue into one word - find the word that most describes
    the problem. For instance, if it is a struggle with someone, perhaps the
    word most descriptive of the problem would be &quot;conflict&quot;. If it is
    a feeling of being unmotivated or stuck, perhaps the word might be
    &quot;stagnate&quot;. Find the best word to describe the negative side of
    the problem.</li>
  <li>Find the polar opposite word - the word that best describes the ideal
    resolution of the issue. For example, the resolution of &quot;conflict&quot;
    could be &quot;harmony&quot; and for &quot;stagnate&quot;, it might be
    &quot;motivated&quot;.</li>
  <li>Put the words into a two word phrase, such as &quot;motivated
    stagnation&quot; or &quot;stagnate motivation&quot;, or &quot;harmonious
    conflict&quot; or &quot;conflictual harmony&quot;.</li>
  <li>The next step is to resonate with these opposites and think of some
    examples of them in an object or process. Nature is a good source to find
    examples of the two forces combined into one. (The Tao is full of nature
    metaphors.) Examples: &quot;harmonious conflict&quot; might be mediation,
    negotiation, symphony, akido, parasites, fever. &quot;Stagnate
    motivation&quot; might be hibernation, cocoon, meditation, yoga, etc. This
    step is one that usually takes some time and/or is one that is helpful to
    brainstorm with other people. Asking others for their response or
    associations to the dialectic can be stimulating and fun. The more examples
    the better your possible choice will be and the more you have
    &quot;played&quot; and opened up new perspectives. It is helpful to do this
    step in a relaxed state:</li>
</ol>
<p>[Find ways of entering a relaxed state of consciousness: going for a walk,
taking a shower, deep relaxed breathing, listening to music, etc.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tao #16</p>
<p>Quiet your mind of thoughts,<br>
So your heart shall be at peace.<br>
Being at peace,<br>
Your imagination may more easily arise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Note: It is our belief that creativity involves 4 phases:</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Motivation: moving towards an Ideal (+) or away from pain or problems
      (-).</li>
    <li>Saturation: total involvement: Information/Knowledge/Experiences.</li>
    <li>Incubation-Alternation: alternating between various states of
      consciousness (Alpha-Beta-Theta and Delta)</li>
    <li>Resolution and /or Revelation (AHA!)].</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>5. Choose one of the examples that resonates with you and write down all of
its qualities. Working with &quot;stagnate motivation&quot;, for instance, one
might choose the concept yoga and have the following associations to it:
stretching, movement, breathing, quiet environment, feeling the moment,
expanding, flexibility, contentment. In doing the list, it is important to write
down anything that comes to mind even if it seems far &quot;afield&quot;. Other
more &quot;way out&quot; ideas connected to yoga might be: India, gurus, cults,
strange, mystical, unknown.</p>
<p>6. Choose one or two of these qualities and &quot;force fit&quot; it back
into the issue. For instance, if one chose the quality of movement they would
ask, &quot; how might movement help with my sense of stagnation&quot;? Perhaps
physical exercise would help - &quot;changing one’s physiology can change one’s
psychology&quot;. Movement might mean bringing more energy into one’s life
through friends, hobbies, classes, etc. Or one could take the broader idea of
yoga and directly force fit it back into the issue. What comes to mind is the
idea that stagnation may be a kind of yoga, a chance to relax, to be &quot;in
the moment&quot;, rather than achieving or doing. In fact that idea connects to
another word on the list, hibernation. Hibernation is a time of deliberately
taking a break, especially in harsh or non-nourishing circumstances, winter.
Hibernation is a way of protecting the organism and resting until circumstances
are more supportive. Perhaps, stagnation is a way of taking a break - a
hibernation of sorts with renewal and rebirth at the other end. Maybe the
environment is not supportive at this point and the solution is to find a more
nourishing community. One might choose one of the words that was more far afield
like, mystical. In what ways might the mystical be involved in stagnation?
Perhaps, stagnation is not the problem but the solution - the unconscious acting
as a guide telling one to stop, to not move forward on a certain project at this
time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tao #23</p>
<p align="center">Nature does not insist,<br>
That things last forever.<br>
High winds may last<br>
For part of a morning,<br>
Heavy rain for half a day.<br>
If nature does not insist,<br>
Why should you?<br>
Like the forces of nature,<br>
Creativity is natural too.<br>
It may flow for part of a day,<br>
Hibernate for half a year,<br>
Or illuminate a night.<br>
Open yourself to it,<br>
And feel well used,<br>
Feel at home,<br>
Feel welcome.<br>
Honor the natural way,<br>
And it will honor you.</p>
<p align="center">(From the book &quot;Tao of Creativity&quot;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the above connections, there are several possible new perspectives on
the problem:</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Infuse more energy or movement</li>
    <li>Change how one thinks about stagnation and embrace it as a time for rest
      and renewal</li>
    <li>Change the environment into a more supportive one</li>
    <li>Perhaps not pursue whatever it was that one was feeling stagnate about,
      maybe their intuition is telling them to not move forward.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>One can take all of the words or processes that were listed and &quot;force
fit&quot; them back into the issue. Pretend it is somebody else’s problem so
that you are freer to try on different possibilities. The answer or resolution
might be right there or it may take some time, an incubation period, to resonate
with some of the new insights. Incubation is an important part of the creative
process. The Dialectic Paradox exercise opens up many possibilities and new ways
of looking at an issue and will bring the Tao philosophy into your creative
thinking process. Play with the ideas and words that come out of doing the
exercise and see if some new perspectives are opened.</p>
