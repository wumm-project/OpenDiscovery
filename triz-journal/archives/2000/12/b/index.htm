<p>Overview:</p>
<p>Leaders in Research &amp; Development usually want consistently higher levels
of innovative outcomes from their organizations than they normally experience.
Attempts at “shotgunning” the problem may produce sporadic results, but
generally innovative outcomes diminish when the shotgun is put away. A better
way to sustain Innovation is to make it as much of the value system as, say,
honesty and integrity. The author shows that this requires making Innovation a
high organizational value, with specific actions leaders can take to make it
happen.</font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000"></p>

<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>The difficulty of making Innovation self-sustaining results from the need to
change corporate values for Innovation in the three arenas of (1) Education, (2)
Application, and (3) Environment, and then to implement each of them using
tangible supports in the (1) Awards given, (2) Taboos enforced, and (3) Rituals
observed. This means improving the organizational culture to one that sustains
Innovation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This article explores the challenge of finding ways to make
Innovation self-sustaining in your organization. It describes the three arenas
of activity that characterize innovative organizations and uses them as a
framework for creating self-sustaining Innovation. The importance of values
expressed in behavior will be addressed. It presents a clear model for guiding
decisions about what tangible organizational systems you can put in place to
continually support behavior that leads to more innovative outcomes.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Three Arenas of the Innovative Organization</p>
</b><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="01.gif" width="300" height="267"></p>
</font>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The three arenas of Figure 1 illustrate the three arenas that
characterize innovative organizations. The larger the area of overlap between
the three arenas, the greater the likelihood of innovative outcomes.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The first arena is Education, and is focussed on <b>the
individual</b>. Individual people have ideas, teams don’t and organizations
don’t. Individuals are responsible for their own thinking, and the better they
are at it, the better the innovative output of the organization. You might want
to sponsor an educational component of any Innovation initiative to help people
be better thinkers.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The second arena is Application, and is focussed on <b>the
team</b>. Teams are formed to solve problems or take advantage of opportunities,
and a shared problem-solving process common to all team members is needed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The third arena is Environment, and is focussed on <b>the
organization</b> (leadership). The climate for Innovation is the perception of
“what it is like to work around here,” and flows directly from the values
expressed in behaviors of the leadership. We strongly believe that the
Environment arena has the greatest impact of the three on the innovative output
of any organization. This view is supported anecdotally, as well as by the work
of Alan G. Robinson and Sam Stern. They note that 50% of the world’s supply of
engineers live and work in Russia today, but not nearly 50% of the Innovations
come from Russia, primarily because of the poor environment for Innovation. They
quote a Russian engineer who said, “A bad system will beat a good man every
time.” Consider that in 1946 when Genrich Altschuller, a patent examiner in
the Russian Navy, showed Stalin his early work that lead to the development of
modern TRIZ methodology, Stalin had him thrown in prison! A number of
organizations have complained to this author that in spite of “creativity
training” (Education arena), there was no observable increase in innovative
output. The model of Figure 1 helps explain why this is so. Without a shared
team problem-solving processes and strong leadership support to build and
maintain an innovative environment, increased innovative output does not result.
A widely held myth is that giving employees creativity training alone will
result in sustained innovative output.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Dimensions of the Climate for Innovation</p>
</b>
<p>A supportive climate for Innovation is one where creativity and change are
encouraged. Based on the pioneering work of Goran Ekvall in Sweden some 25 years
ago, it is now possible to quantify the climate for Innovation. Ekvall's work
has been further refined and validated by Scott Isaksen and others who have
clarified nine dimensions of the climate for Innovation. We have added “Value
for diversity of thinking style” as another dimension, first suggested by Jack
Johnson of The Smithsonian Institution as an important dimension. Although not
in Ekvall’s original dimensions of climate, we agree with Johnson’s
suggestion, and include it here. In our work with research organizations, we
have found the first four dimensions listed below most often are in greatest
need of improvement. After the first four, the remaining dimensions are listed
in no particular order.</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Risk-taking (To what degree is it okay for a
    well-reasoned attempt to not meet expectations when trying something new?)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Trust and Openness (To what degree do people feel safe
    speaking their minds and offering different points of view?)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Idea time (To what degree do people have time to think
    things through before having to act?)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Idea support (To what degree are resources made available
    to give new ideas a try?)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Valuing diversity in thinking style (To what degree do we
    demonstrate value for others who think differently from ourselves by
    including them in the business process?).</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Challenge &amp; Involvement (To what degree are people
    challenged by their work and to what degree are they emotionally involved,
    and committed to the work?)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Freedom (To what degree do people free to decide how to
    do their jobs?)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Playfulness and humor (How relaxed is the workplace? Is
    it okay to have fun?)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Absence of Interpersonal Conflicts (To what degree do
    people refrain from engaging in interpersonal conflict or ‘warfare’?)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Debates (To what degree do people engage in lively
    debates about the issues?)</li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Not only are the first four dimensions the ones usually
needing the most improvement, but we strongly feel they are the ones that are
the most important in shaping the climate for Innovation.</p>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="02.gif" width="400" height="284"></p>
</font>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Looking at the model of Figure 2 shows why we believe this is
so. In the model, the right-most process step is implementation, and that is
where organizations most often fall short in the Innovation process. The
dimensions of climate that we feel most control implementation are Risk-Taking,
Trust &amp; Openness, and Valuing Thinking Style Diversity. It is during
implementation that serious resources are consumed, and people want to feel safe
in allocating resources on ideas that may never deliver a dollar to the bottom
line. In short, it must be OK to not fully meet expectations when giving new
ideas a try. Others have said, and we repeat the importance of making lots of
small mistakes early so they can be corrected at low cost in order to avoid
making the biggest mistake of all - missing the target. If the people associated
with non-successes get punished, you will find few people willing to step out
and try new things. Closely allied with Risk-taking is Trust &amp; Openness.
Trust &amp; Openness with the leadership is so intertwined with Risk-taking that
it is difficult to think of them separately. Valuing Thinking Style Diversity
will lead organizations to assign the right mix of talent to the Innovation team
at the right time in the process. Ignorance of this important factor often
results in the wrong mix of people assigned to projects with disappointing
outcomes.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">So, how does one increase the innovative output of the
organization in a way that is self-sustaining? It means instilling an effective
set of values supporting the Innovation process within the organization that
will continue long after the consultant leaves. Lets look at the “soft stuff”
of values and how they contribute to the “hard stuff” of bottom line
business results.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Values-101 (The Basics)</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Values are those things given status and high priority within
the organization. Another way of saying “climate of Innovation” is to say a
“climate that <b>values</b> Innovation.” Values are good, positive things.
But since specific values always <b><i>compete</i></b> for our allegiance in a
world where we can never do everything we would like, our <b>real</b> values are
reflected in our day-to-day choices. An organization that values Innovation then
must choose Innovation over other values such as predictability, low risk,
efficiency, and having to know all the minute details. An organization’s
climate for Innovation, then is a result of its real values expressed in the
choices it makes. To build a climate of Innovation in your organization requires
that other competing and especially conflicting value-preferences take a back
seat. For example, risk-taking is one of the most important dimensions of the
climate for Innovation, yet many organizations send mixed messages like, “take
risks but don’t fail.” If every single R&amp;D initiative succeeded
brilliantly, you can bet the advances are baby steps forward and are more
adaptive in nature than innovative. Take a look at the choices your organization
makes and the messages they send, then see how well - or poorly - those choices
support the nine dimensions mentioned above.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In his fascinating book Tim O’Connell shows that most often
values flow from the group to the individual,. When new individual joins a
group, they either <b>adopt</b> the values of the group, they <b>reject </b>the
values of the group and eventually leave the group, or in very rare cases, they <b>transform</b>
the group so that it adopts the values of the newcomer. When we experience a
particular value-preference and see that it “works,” we tend to embrace that
value as a priority of our own. Values are adopted as a result of<b> experiences</b>,<b>
</b>not by verbal instruction, and such experiences always happen in groups.
Finally, the group proclaims its value-preferences through <b>stories and
legends</b> and through the body language of <b>gesture and ritual</b>.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Recall some of your <b>experiences</b> when you first joined
your company or group (e.g. Safety meetings, or perhaps basic training about
your new company and its history). What were the messages you received from
them? Think about the <b>stories and legends</b> you heard. Who were the heroes
and how did they become heroes? Who were the outcasts and how did they become
outcasts? An outstanding example of using stories to help inculcate 3M’s value
for Innovation is their handbook, <i>3M Innovation Chronicles</i>. It is a small
but expertly crafted work that speaks volumes about the priority 3M places on
Innovation, and it gives specific examples of what people have done to become
the corporate heroes. At 3M, their Grass Roots Innovation Team (G.R.I.T.) uses
it to help newcomers quickly develop an understanding and appreciation for
Innovation as a core 3M value.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">What messages did you receive from the unspoken but clear <b>‘body
language’</b> of your new organization? What specific behaviors did you
observe? How were people treated, how strongly was the pecking order enforced?
In one telecommunications company a newcomer arrived early and took an empty
seat for a technical review, only to be told quietly but firmly that his seat
was always the lab director’s and he must move. Through events, stories, and
‘body language’ your values were shaped to match those of the group, or you
left the group. Less likely is that you transformed the group to your values.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Examples of Strong Corporate Values</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Ask any DuPont employee what it’s highest corporate value
is, and they will instantly say, “Safety.” At FedEx it might be “On-time
delivery”, and at American Express it is “Customer service.” Would the
importance of any of these values change if the whole leadership team were
replaced overnight? Probably not. When the stated value has taken deep roots
within the organization the value does not change, even with large changes in
leadership. What is the highest corporate value for your organization? How do
you know? If asked, would most employees answer the same way? You might ask
participants in a meeting to write down the three top values in your
organization. Did anyone list “Innovation?” You might then ask what it would
take for them to be able to list “Innovation” in the top three.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Creating a Value-Supporting System</p>
</b><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="03.gif" width="300" height="218"><br>
</font><b>Values Become Real Only When Supported By<br>
Awards, Taboos, And Repetitive Reinforcement.</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Consider the model of Figure 3. It displays the chosen value
as an intangible, and it displays tangible supports for the value as legs of a
three-legged stool. The three “support legs” are (1) Awards, (2) Taboos, and
(3) Repetitive Reinforcement. The stated value is the “talk” of management
while the tangible supports legs are the “walk” of management<b>. </b>In an
ideal world, the “walk” of management matches the “talk,” meaning that
management’s choices reflect the values they espouse. When there is a large
disconnect between the “talk” and the “walk” management loses
credibility and cynicism about the stated value results. One company talked
about “quality” as a high corporate value, only to ship substandard product
when they were in an oversold condition. You can see the problem.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Awards</b> are things given employees for actively supporting
the value, usually done in a public way. <b>Taboos</b> are specific behaviors
that are driven from the organization because they don’t support the stated
value. When enforced, taboos put “teeth in the law” and everybody knows it.
Stories based on an enforced taboo become part of the stories and legends
mentioned above. Enforcing a taboo always causes pain and suffering, and that’s
why it is so difficult to do. When taboos are not enforced people pay lip
service to the value, and management loses credibility<b>. Repetitive
Reinforcements</b> are events that occur on a timetable or schedule and provide
regular reinforcement that the value under discussion is of importance to the
organization. Within DuPont safety has long been regarded as one of the highest
corporate values. This is so because management truly “walks the talk” of
safety. There is a very strong underpinning for safety by the tangible supports
of (1) Awards, (2) Taboos, and (3) Repetitive Reinforcement. At DuPont there are
<b>Awards </b>for every employee on company sites which work injury-free for a
given number of employee-hours, there are safe driving awards, even special
safety awards at times. The <b>Taboos</b> are well known and honored. It is a
strong taboo to break a safety rule. People know and honor the phrase, “You
will work safely or you will work somewhere else.” For <b>Repetitive
Reinforcement</b> there are monthly safety meetings, monthly safety and
housekeeping inspections and reports, and monthly reports of safety statistics
are published company-wide.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Making Innovation a Value</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Creating a self-sustaining organizational climate for
Innovation means <b>transforming</b> the group’s value system by making and
supporting “Innovation” as a real value. This means that leadership must “walk
the talk” if Innovation is to become a self-sustaining value. Ask yourself
what specifically you might do in the areas of Awards, Taboos, and Repetitive
Reinforcements to support in a tangible way “Innovation” as value for your
organization. Each of us is far more impactful than we believe, so even if you
are not the Vice President of Research &amp; Technology or the Lab Director, you
can make an important difference right where you are. As a start, put the word
“Innovation” in the value cloud of Figure 3, then complete the table below
for Awards, Taboos, and Repetitive Reinforcements. Shown in the table are just a
few examples of how you might complete it. Every organization will have its own
set Awards, Taboos, and Repetitive Reinforcements that are appropriate and
unique to it.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Ask yourself, (1) What awards do we currently have for
Innovation, (2) What behaviors will get you punished or fired because they
hinder Innovation, and (3) How do we constantly and routinely remind people of
the importance of Innovation? You will find it hardest to institute punishments
for behavior that you wish to drive from the organization. Driving the Taboo
behavior from the organization is likely to mean driving specific people from
the organization, and that causes pain, and inflicting pain accounts for the
difficulty. Tino Martella, CEO of the Chicago YMCA received the 1997 George Land
World Class Innovator Award on behalf of his organization because of the
Innovations that resulted after changing an entrenched mindset of those in
longtime leadership positions. He ultimately had to announce, “We are going to
change the people, or we are going to change the people.” It ultimately
resulted in a few terminations with the attendant pain, but it got results.
Sometimes the chef must break a few eggs to make an omelet.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Fill in Table 1 with <b>what you do today</b> in the three
areas to support Innovation. You will want to consider the 10 dimensions of the
climate for Innovation and the three arenas of Figure 1 as you go about this
task. Then enter <b>what you might start doing</b> to better support</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Innovation in the three support legs. Engage people at all
levels of your organization in thinking this through. Next<b>, list the barriers</b>
in moving to the desired state from the current state in each of the three
areas. Next you might consider developing teams to tackle specific ways to
overcome the barriers in each of the three areas. Don’t overlook the important
work of leadership in finding ways to celebrate milestones and make heroes of
the people who most helped the organization become more innovative. Innovation
is not a one-shot event, it is a journey without an end. Instilling the values
that support Innovation, and then clearly “walking the talk” is a
distinguishing mark of the transformational leader who can imbue the group with
his/her values and create an innovative organization that can fly on its own
after the consultant leaves.</p>
