<h4><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Introduction</span></font></b></span></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">Designers traditionally find themselves trying to
perform a balancing act between conflicting design parameters; weight versus
strength, speed versus life, efficiency versus complexity, or efficiency versus
cost, to name but a few common trade-off scenarios. In each case, as the
designer tries to improve one parameter, the other tends to get worse. Higher
shaft speeds mean shorter bearing life, close tolerance gears in a gear pump
mean greater pumping efficiency but higher manufacture cost, and so on.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">The net result of these trade-off decisions is a
product which ultimately satisfies no one.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Designers
are generally able to design a system capable of achieving specified performance
goals; lift a certain maximum load a certain distance at a certain speed.
Designers are also generally able to understand that users never ultimately
operate the system in the way they originally intended. They also understand
that real systems made out of real materials will exhibit a degree of variation
in the way they perform. Designers are generally able to specify and design to
accommodate these variations. Some designers are also able to design a product
to achieve a certain prescribed factory cost. This is a not inconsiderable
achievement. Unfortunately, customer expectations are such that even this
capability is no longer sufficient. Sophisticated customers are now demanding
predictable life-cycle cost, a guaranteed life, a guaranteed maintenance-free
period, or even, in some extreme cases, a guaranteed level of performance
retention. In these circumstances, the designer is, generally speaking,
struggling. In the design compromise trade-off scenario, because life issues are
the least well understood, they tend to be the ones which receive least
attention.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">Unlike traditional design strategies, the Russian inventive
problem solving method, TRIZ, (Reference 1,2) encourages designers to eliminate
design compromises and trade-offs rather than accommodate them. Through 1500
person years of research and a comprehensive analysis of over 3 million of the
world’s patents, TRIZ encapsulates the best compromise-eliminating practices
of the world’s inventive minds.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">Based on experiential evidence at the University of
Bath, the four main sources of non-reliability in hydraulic systems are, in
descending order of frequency:-</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in;"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">1)<font size="1" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">Each of these is examined in the context of how&nbsp;
TRIZ’s compromise-eliminating approach can help to shift the paradigm towards
inherently more reliable, longer life system designs.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Design
For Reliability</span></font></b></span></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">The basis of successful reliable designs rests with
the ability to adequately separate specified parameters from the design features
and system properties which together dictate how the system will behave. One
such example, is the need to ensure adequate margin between design loads and the
strength of the materials used in the design - as illustrated in Figure 1.</span></font></span></p>
<p><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial;">Both ‘design loads’ and the corresponding ‘material strength’
come attached to a degree of statistical variation. In very naive terms, if the
designer is able to ensure there is no intersection between the two resulting
statistical characteristics, the design will not fail.</span></font></span>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><img src="image002.gif" width="298" height="198"><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;

Figure 1. </span></font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">Margin
Between Design Load and Material Strength</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">In many instances, the separation of design load and
material strength is determined more by use of empirical rules of thumb, or ‘fudge
factors’. In all instances, there are pressures which cause designers to
reduce the separation between the two curves. These pressures are at root
related to the need to continuously improve customer ‘value’. Value here
following the Miles definition – now adopted widely into the TRIZ methodology
– of customer benefits divided by the sum of harmful factors and cost.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">The pressures impact on design margins in two ways.
Firstly, in terms of increasing customer benefit, there come pressures to
increase the load carrying capability of a system, and secondly, the designer is
encouraged to reduce the cost of the system, usually by decreasing the amount of
material used. The resulting effect is illustrated in Figure 2.</span></font></span></p>
<p align="center"><img src="image004.gif" width="317" height="193"><span class="MsoBodyText"><br clear="ALL">
<b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold">Figure

Effect of Value Increase Drivers on Load/Strength Relationship</span></font></span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">The net result of the two characteristics moving
together is the emergence of the potential – in the area of curve intersection
– for loads to exceed the capabilities of the system, and thus for the
potential of a system failure.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">In many senses, intersection of the load and strength
curves is made inevitable through the combination of competition, driven
primarily in today’s hydraulics industries by performance and cost, and the
failure (on the part of customers usually) to appreciate that performance can
only improve and cost reduce by so much before something – usually reliability
– has to concede. And because the reliability issues may only become apparent
two or three years downstream of the point of purchase, they inevitably receive
least attention.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">The issues surrounding the idea of conflicting
customer drivers producing a limiting contradiction – increased performance
plus reduced cost must ultimately equal reduced reliability – will be
re-visited in a later section. In the meantime, it may be observed that the idea
of designers trying to find an acceptable balance between conflicting parameters
– as is the case in instances like the one described here – is the
traditional way in which the design process is carried out. The designer may of
course apply a number of techniques to improve the situation – cut off the low
ends of the material strength characteristic through inspection, for example, or
cut-off the high-end of the load characteristic by adding relief valves or other
devices to the system. Either way, it is usually the case that designers accept
these overall conflict trade-offs as inherent to the design process; accept that
they are a ‘fundamental’ absolute.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">The TRIZ design approach says that they are
not.&nbsp; TRIZ contains the findings of those inventors who have identified and
eliminated the contradictions.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">The process by which TRIZ does this is best
illustrated through an example. In keeping with the fact that leakage is an
important source of unreliability, the example describes the case of a bolted
flange joint between two pipe lengths.</span></font></span></p>
<h1><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Flange
Joint</span></font></b></span></h1>
<span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">The
bolted flange joint is a very common engineering structure. The traditional
approach taken in the design of such flange joints is to balance between the
many conflicting parameters present in the basic design concept. Although the
designer may not always be directly conscious of the conflicts, it is possible
to plot each one graphically in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 3. A
typical design conflict, then, between two parameters A and B is such that as
the designer tries to improve one, the other tends to get worse, and vice versa.
The characteristic hyperbolic line relating the two parameters can be seen as a
line of constant design capability.</span></font></span>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><img src="image006.gif" width="307" height="232"><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;

Figure 3. </span></font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">Graphical
Representation of Technical Contradiction</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">With
respect to a conventional flange joint design, several such conflict graphs may
be depicted. For example, there are well-established design rules defining the
number of bolts required around the joint to provide an adequate seal. The
conflict here exists between the number of bolts used and the leakage
performance of the flange. The task of the designer is then traditionally to
find a balance between the two conflicting parameters. This process is
illustrated in Figure 4.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">The three main steps in the process are:-</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">(1) – The designer is under real pressure to minimise the
number of bolts in the system in order to, amongst other things, minimise cost,
minimise assembly time, and maximise the convenience of use to the customer.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">(2)
The inevitable result of this design intent is to worsen the likely reliability
of the seal.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">(3)&nbsp;
The designer will aim for a compromise in which ‘acceptable’ seal
performance is achieved, and the number of bolts is minimised.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><img src="image008.gif" width="317" height="249"><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;

Flange: Traditional Design Rationale</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText3" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">The
graph perhaps also begins to explain why so many flange joints leak. This is
particularly apparent when aspects like the often poorly understood degradation
of the flange performance over time are taken into account. I.e. what starts out
as ‘acceptable’ sealing performance when the flange is new, turns into ‘unacceptable’
performance after the ravages of time and customer usage.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">TRIZ
encourages designers to identify and then seek to eliminate the sorts of
conflict illustrated in Figure 3. The method has captured a generic problem
solving framework through which a designer is able to map his or her own
particular design conflict onto similar ones in which inventors have
successfully overcome the design conflict.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">In
the case of the flange joint design, Reference 3 describes how TRIZ was used to
break out of the traditional design trade-odd scenario to produce the
paradigm-shifting design solution illustrated in Figure 5.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><img src="image010.gif" width="298" height="240"><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold"><br>

Patent: 5230540, ‘Fluid-Tight Joint With Inclined Flange Face</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">This design enables designers to achieve the same sealing
performance as a conventional parallel-faced flange design with typically half
the number of bolts.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">In terms of the original, Figure 3, conflict representation,
by simply introducing a small angle onto one of the flange faces, the designer
has drawn a new improved characteristic relationship between the parameters –
Figure 6.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText3" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">The
bolt number versus reliability contradiction still exists, of course, in the
angled flange design. The point, however, is that TRIZ has changed the design
paradigm by creating a new relationship between the two conflicting parameters
(4). Successive application of the method – as illustrated in Figure 6 –
moves the design towards a point where the contradiction is completely
eliminated. The figure graphically illustrates the key difference between the
TRIZ and traditional ‘design-is-a-trade-off’ design approaches.</span></font></span></p>

<h1><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Transitioning
The Paradigm Shift To Other Areas</span></font></b></span></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">The
angled flange joint design solution shown above is certainly not a new one, and
was known about in certain industries long before the gas-turbine industry
re-invented it for themselves in the Figure 5 design.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">The
point here is that ‘good’ design solutions have a very strong tendency to
travel only very slowly between different industry sectors.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">This
is a phenomenon long recognised by the Russian researchers who constructed the
TRIZ methodology. They have sought to overcome the problem through a combination
of capture of inventive ideas in a&nbsp; generically applicable sense, and a
recognition of the need to find a way of classifying these ‘good’ design
solutions in a manner which makes them accessible to other designers in whatever
industry sector.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">It
is often the case currently that these good solutions travel badly even within
their existing industry sectors. An example of this – and also incidentally an
example of the Figure 6 idea of successive design paradigm shifts – is the
conceptual V-Band clamp based design solution derived at Bath and illustrated in
Figure 7.</span></font></span></p>
<p align="center"><img src="image014.gif" width="345" height="155"><br>
<span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold">Figure

<span style="layout-grid-mode:line">Possible Application of Inclined Flange Face
Concept to Other Design Solutions</span></span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">Here,
the design achieves a better flange joint which uses only one bolt, or,
expressed another way, seals significantly better than a conventional V-band
clamp design. It is also perhaps worth noting that there is no existing patent
which covers this solution.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">The
angled-face/reduced contact area concept has also thus far failed to travel to
other areas within and around the fluid power industry, despite the fact that
there is no logical reason why it shouldn’t. Thought about in this way, there
is no reason why the concept couldn’t similarly be deployed to significant
beneficial effect in a whole host of fluid power industry applications from
quick-release couplings to valve-block seals to hydraulic motor casings to
actuator endcap designs… and so on.</span></font></span></p>
<h1><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Knowledge

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">The
problem of poor knowledge transfer between subject areas and industry sectors is
illustrated in Figure 8.</span></font></span></p>
<p align="center"><img src="image016.gif" width="279" height="187"><br>
<span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold">Figure

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">The figure suggests that a designer working in the fluid
power industry is highly unlikely to look outside his or her industry to find
problem solutions. The phenomenon is understandable from a number of
perspectives, not least of which is the fact that a good designer will often
have trained and practiced for a considerable number of years in a particular
discipline.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">TRIZ calls this propensity to look for design solutions
within the realms of our known experience&nbsp; ‘psychological inertia’
(Reference 5).</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">The flange joint example shows how TRIZ helps to overcome
psychological inertia through a generic contradiction-eliminating problem
solving framework. A second method is the more direct approach of expressing
existing solutions in a form accessible to others. An alphabetic listing (for
example) of all of the world’s good design concepts and solutions would
probably be of very limited value; adequate if the designer was looking for
other ‘flange’ designs, but wholly inadequate if the search was required to
be more broad.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">The principle, then, upon which TRIZ makes good designs
accessible to others in whatever industry they might be, is to classify the
solutions in terms of their <b><span style="font-weight:bold">function</span></b>.
Thought about in this manner, the designer is no longer looking for a ‘flange’
– a specific solution – but is looking for a ‘breakable joint’ – i.e.
a generic function.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">Several such functionally classified knowledge databases now
exist. Probably the best of these databases is the one to be found in the
Invention Machine TechOptimizer</span></font><font size="2" face="Symbol"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol;">Ò</span></font><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">
software (Reference 6). The database found in the latest version of the software
contains over 6000 physical, chemical and mathematical effects, and engineering
design solutions, and by the end of the year will probably contain over 7500.</span></font></span></p>
<h5><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Reliability
Knowledge Transfer</span></font></b></span></h5>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">In
the same way that ‘function’ is the common thread by which good design ideas
can be transferred more readily between different industry sectors, the TRIZ
Contradiction Matrix (Reference 2, 7) is the mechanism by which the
contradiction-eliminating good practice of the world’s finest inventors is
made accessible by designers working in other fields.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">The Contradiction Matrix offers a generic problem solving
tool in which the problem solver is required to map a specific problem into the
generic 39x39 structure of the Matrix. The two sides of the Matrix comprise a
list of 39 engineering parameters. ‘Reliability’ is one of the generic
parameters contained in the list.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">Analysis
of the Matrix highlights an interesting trend in relation to how other inventors
have sought to resolve reliability versus other parameter conflicts.&nbsp;
Looking across all 38 of the other parameters in the Matrix with which
Reliability can conflict – whether that be physical parameters, performance
parameters, other ‘ility parameters, or manufacture related parameters –
highlights the fact that only a relatively small proportion of the 40 Inventive
Principles contained in TRIZ has been used by past inventors to ‘eliminate’
reliability-centred contradictions.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">Based
on the Contradiction Matrix analysis, the top six most common Inventive

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">The
other 34 Principles lag a long way behind. This is not to say that they have no
value, just that to date, inventors have had most success with the above six
strategies. It is interesting to note how some of the six might usefully be
applied to the problem of improving the reliability of seals used in hydraulic
systems. A generic rotating seals example will be used.</span></font></span></p>
<h1><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Rotating
Seals</span></font></b></span></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">Traditional solutions to the ‘rotating seal’ functional
requirement within the fluid power industry predominantly comprise of labyrinth,
o-ring, brush, or designs containing a combination of these types. Whilst
undoubtedly rugged (and cheap), these design solutions also help to explain why
so many hydraulic systems suffer from leakage problems.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">The most commonly applied Inventive Principle in the
reliability context is to ‘change physical parameters’. This recommendation
occurs from another TRIZ finding that a given material system hits fundamental
limitations, such that, for example, a mechanical seal can only be improved so
much before it hits a limit beyond which it cannot progress. In this case, it is
the need to reduce clearances (and hence tighten manufacture tolerances) to a
point which makes the system vulnerable to contaminants of an increasingly small
size, and ultimately a size which cannot be filtered out (see later section on
self-cleaning filter however) which fundamentally limits the capability of the
seal. The ‘change physical parameters’ principle (indeed also the ‘mechanics
substitution’ Principle also in the top six) suggests a move towards a
non-mechanical solution.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">One such solution is illustrated in Figure 9.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">This design solution – originally conceived for use in the
laboratory high vacuum sector –&nbsp; may well be appropriate in some form in
fluid power based applications.</span></font></span></p>
<p align="center"><img src="image018.gif" width="310" height="194"><br>
<span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold">Figure

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">Similarly, other rotating seal solutions from other
industries include the design – taken from the aerospace sector this time –
illustrated in Figure 10.&nbsp; The concept makes effective use of a ferro-magnetic
fluid to provided a seal during low pressure differential, low rotational speed
operation, which then turns into a powerful centrifugal seal as duty increases.</span></font></span></p>
<p align="center"><img src="image020.gif" width="576" height="252"><br>
<span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold">Figure

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">Of
course, there will need to be certain modifications to both such designs to
accommodate the specific boundary conditions of the adopting industry sector,
but there is no doubt that conceptually the above magnetic seal offers a highly
rugged, affordable (particularly with a non-switched magnet), low friction,
zero-fluid-loss solution to a variety of fluid power system design problems.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Coming
back to the earlier point about knowledge transfer between industry sectors, it
is instructive to observe how TRIZ encourages designers to look beyond the
current industry design conventions. The Contradictions/Inventive Principles
route provides ‘triggers’ to invention (how can ‘mechanics substitution be
applied to this problem?’), or alternatively, the designer could have
travelled the functionality route - establishing whether other industry sectors
have found other, better ways of achieving the ‘rotating seal’ function –
and arriving at the above two solutions that way.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold">Relationship
Between Reliability and System Evolution S-Curve</span></font></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">All
designers recognise the difficulties of designing reliability into an existing
hydraulic system. The right time to think about reliability is at the
drawing-board stage. This is of course unhelpful if the system is already out in
the field.</span></font></span></p>
<span class="MsoBodyText">An unfortunate paradox exists here between the need to
design for reliability from day one, and the lack of interest of most customers
in reliability until a technology is relatively mature (Reference 8). Figure 11
illustrates the point.</span>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><img src="image022.gif" width="273" height="231"><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold"><br>
Figure 11</span></font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">:
Area in System Evolution where&nbsp; Reliability Issues Become Important</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">During the birth and growth phases of a system (or
technology – we could relate the S-curve to mean hydraulics in general),
designers and customers are both focused on, first making the system work at
all, then working optimally, then maximising efficiency. Reliability
considerations emerge only when the technology is relatively mature, and the
scope of possibilities for further evolution is already limited. In other words
because hydraulics is a relatively mature technology it is reaching its
fundamental limits of advancement.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">In terms of the trends of evolution predicted by TRIZ,
hydraulic solutions supercede mechanical solutions. The inherently improved
flexibility and reliability of hydraulics over a mechanical solution has been a
major reason for the success of hydraulics. Now customer expectations on
reliability are beginning to exceed the fundamental capability of hydraulic
systems, the industry must look to markedly changing paradigms (Reference 9).</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">A good example comes in another of the main sources of
non-reliability in hydraulic systems; that of contamination:</span></font></span></p>
<h5><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Self-Cleaning
Filter</span></font></b></span></h5>
<p class="MsoBodyText3"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">The
previous seal discussion touched on another limiting contradiction relating to
hydraulic systems, in which customer demands for increased system performance
capability, operating efficiency and general ‘operability’ dictate the need
for ever tighter manufacture tolerances and clearances between components.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText3" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">In
many applications the contradiction has reached a point where a system is now
potentially at risk from contaminants as small as 1</span></font><font face="Symbol"><span style="font-family:Symbol;">m</span></font>m
in diameter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText3" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">This
in turn creates a very challenging contradiction with respect to the design of
barrier filters: Fine mesh size will be good for trapping such small particles,
but will block up potentially very quickly; coarse mesh size will have a long
life but will not remove fine particles. In TRIZ terms, the barrier filter is
more or less at its evolutionary limit, and no further progress in overall
system reliability will come from barrier filters without solving the ‘mesh
must be coarse AND fine’ contradiction.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText3" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">The
concept of a ‘self-cleaning’ filter overcomes the limiting contradiction by
effectively beginning a new S-Curve. Referring back to the list of Inventive
Principles used to solve reliability-centred problems, it is also encouraging to
note that the conceptual self-cleaning filter being researched at the University
of Bath uses two of the six Principles cited. More details of the filter may be
found in Reference 10.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText3" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:bold">Limiting
Contradictions</span></font></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText3" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">The
idea of limiting contradictions is very important in the context of designing
for reliability in the hydraulics field. This is particularly so with respect to
early identification of areas which will hit their fundamental limits of
capability.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText3" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Identification
of limiting contradictions may be performed at various levels in a hydraulic
system hierarchy – e.g. the filtration sub-system has a limiting contradiction
in the same way that the whole system has.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText3" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">At
the whole-system level, it is possible to identify the limiting contradictions
through an analysis of customer and manufacture design drivers. In the great
majority of instances, these overall directions are ‘obvious’ – Figure 12.</span></font></span></p>

Mobile Hydraulics Application Design Directions</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">In
a traditional design approach, the designer seeks to find the best compromise
between the various conflicting parameters. In the context of ‘inadequate
specification’ being the single biggest source of system unreliability, this
trade-off process lays the foundations of the future reliability, and other
system, limitations.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">Analysis of a generic mobile hydraulics application sees the
emergence of three potentially limiting contradictions:-</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">1)<font size="1" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></font>Pump ripple. Demands for increased reliability ultimately impact
on the need to tackle the noise and vibration implications inherent to fixed
displacement pumping systems. This contradicts with drives to reduce cost and
complexity of the system. Solving noise and vibration issues through the
traditional approach of adding parts to the system fundamentally (Reference 10)
fails to tackle the contradiction. The TRIZ compromise-free solution of a ‘ripple-less’
pump is required if the contradiction is to be eliminated.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">2)<font size="1" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></font>Valve Flow-Forces. Here the contradiction concerns the demand for
increased operability versus, again, the need to reduce rather than increase
system complexity. Traditional approaches say find an acceptable balance, the
TRIZ approach says determine the actual function of a valve and eliminate the
contradiction by designing a system which is both simple and inherently free of
flow-forces.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;">3)<font size="1" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></font>Cooling Systems. In several mobile applications, the design of the
cooling system has already become a limiting contradiction. The conflict here
derives from the contradiction between simultaneous demands for increased system
duty and decreased system size. The oil-cooler takes the brunt of this
contradiction, because it has more work to do and less space in which to do it.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;">Fundamental improvements in the reliability of hydraulic
systems will come only after these limiting or potentially limiting
contradictions are overcome. They can only be overcome through the application
of contradiction-eliminating techniques such as those found in TRIZ. All three
are the subject of ongoing research at the University of Bath (Reference 10).
Work on a novel contradiction-breaking heat exchanger concept transferable to
hydraulic applications is described in Reference 11.</span></font></span></p>

<h1><span class="MsoBodyText"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">CONCLUSIONS</span></font></b></span></h1>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;">Inherent
    hydraulic system reliability levels are becoming progressively less
    acceptable to customers due to increasing maintenance-free operation and
    durability demands.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;">Reliability
    is best designing into a system at the drawing-board stage. In this case,
    and also cases where a system is already in service and its reliability is
    found to be unacceptable, significant design paradigm shifts are required if
    overall reliability levels are to be noticeably improved.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;">Current
    design methods do not appear to offer adequate answers. The existing design
    paradigms are approaching the limits of their capability. New paradigms are
    required if significantly better solutions are to be achieved.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;">Tools
    contained in the TRIZ inventive problem solving methodology – particularly
    those associated with the identification and ‘elimination’ of ‘limiting
    contradictions’ – offer significant potential for shifting design
    paradigms to allow the realisation of significantly more reliable hydraulic
    systems.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;">Like
    many other industry sectors, the fluid power industry is guilty of failing
    to take maximum advantage of the good design solutions obtained in other
    sectors, despite the fact that the functions being sought – e.g. ‘seal’
    – are commonly very similar.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;">The
    TRIZ methodology, coupled with emerging function based ‘knowledge
    management’ capabilities, provides a basis upon which the good solutions
    from other industries can be made readily accessible to fluid power industry
    companies.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;">Novel
    static and rotating seal design concepts, building on paradigm-shifting TRIZ
    and knowledge transfer principles, have been suggested.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;">Limiting
    contradictions for a generic mobile hydraulics application have been
    identified, and contradiction-eliminating conceptual design solutions have
    been suggested.</li>
