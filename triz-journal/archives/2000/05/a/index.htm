<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Review
Science? Why do that? Well, it is our experience that a major difficulty people
have with implementing TRIZ is the way that scientific thinking is represented
in the problem you have.</span></font></p>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">As
it is the way it is represented that is the problem, our book deals with the
psychology of innovation and the issues of thinking in a scientific way that
relates to the design process.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Science
can be dreary stuff, especially when you get into the strict rules that say ‘you
can do this but you cannot do that.’ In inventing, we do not like the word ‘cannot’,
so our look at science is more about taking oblique, irreverent and sometimes
downright unscientific views on it.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">But
why? Should we not use science as it is? After all, many great minds have worked
for many years on giving us a sound set of rules. The answer is yes and no. Yes,
science is extremely useful but, as we shall say again, you do not have to be a
scientist to invent things with science. And furthermore, blindly accepting what
you are given is not a sound basis for inventing new futures for the world.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Consequently,
the science chapters are about looking at science and thinking differently. We
start from some fairly deep fundamentals (although we stay firmly outside of the
frightening world of quantum mechanics!) and then take an unusual peek at a
scientific principle (friction) before attacking some everyday odds and ends
from a new science point of view.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">We
hope you will find our review of interest and value. TRIZ is developing and our
thoughts are developing – all comments welcome!</span></font></p>
<h1><b><font size="5" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:20.0pt;font-weight:normal">A
</span></font></b><span lang="EN-GB">Simple Science</span></h1>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">To
invent physical things, it is helpful to know a little bit of science. Only a
little bit? It would be reasonable to assume that that invention requires
knowledge which is at the cutting edge of scientific advances or is at least
degree-level. Occasionally this is true, but for many very useful and valuable
inventions, it is not. In fact many great inventions were created by people who
were working outside their original domain of knowledge. The experts in the
field would have complained that these people were not <i><span style="font-style:italic">real
</span></i>scientists and that they were probably not even practising <i><span style="font-style:italic">real</span></i>
science. Maybe they were thinking a different kind of science! And if they are
having fun at the same time, perhaps they could be accused of practising <i><span style="font-style:italic">fun</span></i>science.
Fancy that.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Although
some scientists would like you to believe otherwise, science is really quite a
simple thing, especially if we start from the basic stuff. Going back to first
principles gives us a number of advantages. Firstly, by being able to step back
from existing bodies of knowledge, we can avoid being trapped by them. Secondly,
the deeper level of understanding that working with fundamentals gives us
enables us to invent on a more subtle and pervasive level. Last, but not least,
basic science is easier to understand than the many complexities that have been
built on top of it. Keeping it simple enables you to ask similar simple
questions for many different situations. And simple questions are often the
stimulus for new thinking.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">So
if you are a scientist, be prepared to forget some of your training. Unlearning
can be more difficult than learning, but it is often very helpful to be able to
look at things with fresh eyes. Inspiration can be found all around us, and
nature is a rich, though not infinite source. We will be considering some of
natures ideas and limitations in some of the sections below.</span></font></p>
<h2><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt">What
is science?</span></font></b></h2>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">A
lot of science is presented as being about numbers. How strong is this bar of
metal? How far away is this planet? How fast is the car going? Of course,
numbers are important when you make something, because the parts need to be of
the right size, strength and weight and so on, but numbers are not very helpful
in the early stages of inventing.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">To
invent, it is best to put the idea of numbers to one side (which should please
those who like science but hate the mathematics!) If you have a good, inventive
design then it is surprisingly easy to find someone who can do the numbers for
you, unless it is extremely complex or very, very new science.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Facts
are also things you might want to park somewhere. Scientific facts are used to
constrain and restrain, saying why you should not be doing things. Scientific
facts define the boundaries, the limits of a system of knowledge. To invent, you
must go beyond limits and shatter existing assumptions.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">For
inventing it is best to think of science as a process of asking questions. As
the great physicist Niels Bohr said, “Everything I utter must be understood
not as an affirmation but as a question.”&nbsp; To ask a question, think
carefully about the models, theories, frameworks or patterns you are using to
understand both the current problem and the potential solution, then question
any and all of these. Questioning highlights what you do not know, and what you
do not know is an opportunity, waiting for discovery and invention.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Science
can also be viewed as simply being about identifying the patterns in the
universe and codifying these into models and equations. If you can see patterns
that nobody else has seen, you have invented a new science! Tools for inventing
are process tools for working with patterns. These process tools provide
individual activities and whole phases of action you can use to go from an
initial idea to a complete invention.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Although
tools are very useful, the best scientists do not let their process tools get in
the way of open enquiry as they use both structured and unstructured methods of
investigation and development. When they see potential winning patterns, then
like chess grandmasters, they redouble their efforts to find even better
patterns.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">At
its most simple level, science can be viewed in terms of <i><span style="font-style:italic">energy
(including forces), matter, space </span></i>and <i><span style="font-style:italic">time</span></i>.
In this chapter, we will look at these factors and start to think about how they
can be used in inventing.</span></font></p>
<h2><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt">Science
and energy</span></font></b></h2>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">At
the most basic level of science, there is energy, which we can either store or
use. The most fundamental storage of energy is matter, as Einstein identified in
his famous equation E=mc<sup>2</sup>, where E is energy, m is mass and c is the
speed of light. It does not take much material to create a very big bang. Energy
moves through a medium (such as magnetic or electric fields) in waves.</span></font></p>
<p class="Picture"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt"><img width="294" height="100" src="image002.gif"></span></font></p>
<p class="Picturetext"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Fig.<a name="figenergystorage"></a></span></font></b><span lang="EN-GB">1</span><span lang="EN-GB">
Energy storage and use by wave-matter conversion</span></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">We
can also store energy by <i><span style="font-style:italic">position</span></i>,
such as the potential energy gained when I put a can on a shelf. Energy can be
stored as a potential where there are fundamental forces that attract or repel
objects, as in Fig. </span></font><span lang="EN-GB">2</span><span lang="EN-GB">.
The attraction that holds the can on the shelf is, of course, between the earth
and the can. The energy is stored in the distortion of the gravitational field!
So now you know!</span></p>
<p class="Picture"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt"><img width="292" height="153" src="image004.gif"></span></font></p>
<p class="Picturetext"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Fig.
<a name="figmovement"></a></span></font></b><span lang="EN-GB">2</span><span lang="EN-GB">
Energy storage and use by movement</span></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">We
cannot see stored energy, and it only becomes apparent when we use it, where it
can be sensed in terms of movement, heat, light and the effects of electricity
and magnetism. We can simplify these into two forms: movement and waves. Heat
comes from the movement of atoms, whilst light, electricity and magnetism are
all forms of electromagnetic radiation.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Although
it seems that energy is used, this is not really true. When stored energy is
used, it does not disappear, it is simply converted from one form of energy to
another, and much inventing goes on around this conversion. When I start my car,
I want the fuel to be converted into direct movement, not heat and sound (which
is vibration of molecules), although it would not matter if intermediate forms
of energy are used: it is the leakage of these that causes the problem.&nbsp; If
we could convert energy efficiently, we would make life easier and also be more
ecologically sound.</span></font></p>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Inventing
with energy</span></font></b></h3>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">To
invent with energy, you can start by taking the energy situation in your problem
and breaking it down to find the attributes. Fig. 3 does some of this breaking
down for different forms of energy. Let us consider some of the aspects of this
diagram (which deliberately decomposes in different ways):</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span lang="EN-GB">The long list from ‘light’ shows
some <i><span style="font-style:italic">attributes </span></i>of light, which
can be changed. For example if increasing light in a room, you could increase
reflection with more metallic surfaces.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span lang="EN-GB">The long breakdown chain from ‘electromagnetic’
leads to specific elements that can be changed, for example sunglasses could
work by using an optical bandpass filter to select only specific frequencies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span lang="EN-GB">Stored energy is linked to force.
Although they are not strictly identical, imagine holding a spring squeezed in.
The energy stored is felt as a force. Where you need a force, think about how
you can input some energy and then hold it in place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span lang="EN-GB">Energy can be combined with other
elements of simple science: the use of energy over time is work (so you can
change work by changing energy or time).</span></p>
<p class="Picture"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt"><img width="467" height="342" src="image006.gif"></span></font></p>

Energy breakdown</span></font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">We
can play with energy by taking any of the attributes, storage methods or
decomposed detail, and changing them in some way. We can change energy from one
form to another, or maybe prevent the energy from converting or escaping. In any
situation, ask questions like, ’Where is the energy? What is it doing? Where
is it going? How can I change these?’ Fig. 4 offers some challenges to turn
play into invention.</span></font></p>

<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Science
and force</span></font></b></h3>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">A
large part of science, (and particularly in areas where inventing is
significant) is about the use of energy in interaction between objects, whether
it is atoms within a bending bar or friction between the bar and the table on
which it is placed. How many forces do you think can act between two objects? In
fact there are only four, as in Fig. </span></font><span lang="EN-GB">5</span><span lang="EN-GB">,
and even better, two of them are probably not available for you to change,
leaving two forces available for simple scientific inventing, electromagnetic
and gravity (which we cannot change except by changing the mass of things so the
main one we use is electromagnetic).</span></p>
<p class="Picture"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt"><img width="239" height="194" src="image010.gif"></span></font></p>

Four forces</span></font></b></p>
<h4><i><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Strong
and weak nuclear forces</span></font></i></h4>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">The
Strong nuclear force is the strongest force and binds the central parts of an
atom together (the protons and neutrons). The Weak nuclear force is weaker than
the electromagnetic force but stronger than gravity! It effects things inside
the atom only and its role is really at the level of quantum physics, (by that
we mean complex and small!). Fortunately, for both Strong and Weak forces, their
effect is just about zero beyond the distance of the width of an atom so unless
you are going to make some pretty big nuclear devices you probably will not be
changing these. Except for physicists, these forces can be forgotten about when
inventing.</span></font></p>
<h4><i><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Gravity</span></font></i></h4>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Gravity
is more than the downward pull of bodies towards the earth, as <i><span style="font-style:italic">all
</span></i>bodies attract one another. It is also a very weak force for small or
distant bodies, although we do not think about gravity as being weak because we
can feel it in our bodies and things we pick up may feel heavy. At a long
distance it is the greatest force. For example, there is massive electrical
activity in the sun which does not attract metal on earth anywhere near as much
as the sun’s gravitational pull.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Gravitational
attraction and consequent force is connected with size, which is why the Earth
is pulled by the Sun, and distance, which is why the Moon is held in by the
Earth and is not pulled away by the Sun. By the time we get down to the size of
people and inventions, the force is much smaller.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">The
bottom line is that although gravity may be a consideration for your inventions,
you cannot change it (although as an example of how assumptions can always be
challenged, at the time of writing, research is going on into the use of
gyroscopes that change their weight when rotating very fast. Perhaps one day we <i><span style="font-style:italic">will
</span></i>be able to invent with gravitational forces.)</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Where
gravitational effects <i><span style="font-style:italic">can </span></i>be
played with is in the mass of items. Mass can be changed with different
materials, shapes and construction methods such as the judicious use of holes.</span></font></p>
<h4><i><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Electromagnetic
forces</span></font></i></h4>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Electromagnetic
forces are not just about wires: they are also about how one object holds on to
another. Electromagnetic forces are familiar to anyone who has rubbed a balloon
on their pullover and stuck it to the ceiling. These are forces that we can play
with, and we will discuss them later on.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">We
are surrounded by electromagnetic fields, which affect how things are attracted
or repulsed. These forces also bind atoms and molecules together, and in our
world of physical things it is only the electromagnetic forces that count.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">When
materials are pushed against one another they resist the push through the
electromagnetic repulsion in the atoms and molecules. As you push on a material
the fields are being pushed together and they resist. Every object resting on
another is distorting it by displacing molecules, usually only very slightly. No
material is absolutely rigid because it could not be. The force back has to be
created by something and that force is electromagnetic! When the force is
removed, the material, if it has been elastically distorted only, will spring
back to shape.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">In
chemical bonding, the electrons in the shells of the atoms are shared, which
creates a fair to very strong bond, but it is still an electromagnetic force.
The glue that sticks your fingers together is the glue of electromagnetism!</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">When
any two objects are placed in contact with one another, the electromagnetic
fields of the atoms at the surface of contact will interact with one another,
typically resulting in some degree of attraction. A similar attractive effect
occurs when molecules are mixed or in solution, such as the way water molecules
bonded loosely with salt to make a saline solution.</span></font></p>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Inventing
with forces</span></font></b></h3>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Inventing
with forces often has to do with either trying to make things stick together or
trying to separate them. Many large businesses are built on how things stick
together, not only around adhesives, but also in such diverse subjects as paint
and furniture. 3M, for example, uses bonding inventions for everything from
sandpaper to Post-it Notes. Modern aeroplanes are largely stuck together with
glue, which help make the plane much more rigid than if nuts and bolts had been
used.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">The
bonds that can be played with include the attachment of electrons to atoms, the
attraction of molecules to one another within a single substance and the
interaction of different substances when brought together. Electronic, chemical,
material and mechanical inventions all deal with bonding forces to different
degrees.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Electromagnetic
forces are involved in all the bonding, pushing and pulling that goes on between
atoms and materials, whether they are solid or liquid or gaseous. The invention
battleground is the electromagnetic field! Even light, which as a photon is the
smallest constituent of an electromagnetic field. In fact, in quantum physics,
the force of electromagnetism is created by the exchange of photons, though not
at the wavelength we see.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Inventing
with forces at the most fundamental level means thinking about the
electromagnetic effects. We can also think about ways to apply forces at higher
levels, such as with hammers or clamps. We can change the energy source, for
example using electrical or chemical methods. After constant problems with
compressed air for vehicle airbags, a chemical explosion was found to be
simpler, cheaper and more reliable.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">If
we combine force with other aspects of energy, matter, space and time, we can
find other ways to use the force. Applying the force over a period of time will
require a greater energy reserve. Pulsing the energy as in a jack-hammer can be
very powerful. The required force may be reduced if the area of effect is
reduced, as with a knife blade or the tines of a fork.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">To
play with forces, think about the different aspects of the force, how you can
change them, how you can combine them with other things. Vary the source, time,
area, location, direction and more. Use springs and levers, explosions and
attacks. Change push into pull and press into pulse. Just playing and
experimenting can reveal useful surprises!</span></font></p>

<h2><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt">Science
and matter</span></font></b></h2>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Matter
means material, the stuff from which we make our physical inventions. This is an
area in which nature has done many experiments and where we can find many
inspirations (in fact, copying nature has been given a name: bionics). For
example, Alexander Graham Bell used the human ear as a model for the telephone
and principles of frog’s eyes were used in an aircraft altitude indicator.</span></font></p>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Atomic
thinking</span></font></b></h3>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">A
very basic way of inventing with matter is to think of what is happening to the
atoms and molecules. A nice and unscientific way of viewing atoms is as little
sticky balls, which usually like first to stick to one another. Crystals stick
in nice patterns, but mostly the sticking is fairly untidy and atoms will slide
about as the material is flexed. In liquids and gases, of course, the atoms move
about even more.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">One
of the interesting things that happens with atoms is at the surface or edge of
things. Here, they only have around half the normal number of similar atoms to
stick to, which tends to make them panic somewhat. This can result in strange
surface effects such as microscopic deformations or bonding to what ever is next
to it (this is how adhesives work). Surface atoms are also exposed to attack by
external atoms and energies. The surface atoms will even sometimes shake free of
the parent material and float away (as in evaporation) or the may be stolen away
by more attractive external atoms or simply knocked off by the odd passing
molecule of water of air or even a bird’s foot! When this happens, energies
that are released can exacerbate the situation (or may be utilised by canny
inventors!).</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Molecules
act like big atoms, but add to the complexity of the situation as they can now
take different shapes, such as long thin molecules that can form flexible but
strong fibres. They also can break up when they meet other molecules that react
with them, or are exposed to energy sources such as ultra-violet radiation.</span></font></p>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Mass
and density</span></font></b></h3>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Matter
has mass, but not weight, as weight is an effect of gravity (in space, things
are weightless, but their mass is unchanged). Weight is also a force and hence
has a direction. For most purposes, we do not need to differentiate between mass
and weight, but it is still worth knowing the difference.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Matter
has density, which may be consistent through the object or may vary thought it.
This is an area where we have a greater range of options than nature: our flesh
and internal organs are made up of a very similar sort of flexible material,
whilst bones and teeth are similar types of calciferous substances.&nbsp; A
result of this is that most natural bodies end up with a fairly standard
density.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">In
inventions, the weight need not be proportional to size, as we have a much wider
range of options in the materials we use.</span></font></p>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Flexibility
and rigidity</span></font></b></h3>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Nature
is, on the whole, pretty floppy. It achieves rigidity in the skeletons of its
structures, but mostly it finds flexibility a more useful proposition for many
purposes. The human world, on the other hand, is full of rigid structures. When
nature puts rigidity on the outside, as with the crab’s shell, it also limits
the ability of its inhabitant to grow (in fact, the only natural shape that
allows ongoing growth is the snail’s spiral shell). We are not constricted by
such concerns.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">When
you need flatness, it is a dilemma if you also want lightness and rigidity.
Nature overcomes this effect in several ways, for example when it wants to keep
a leaf open. Simple curvature quickly makes a flat item more rigid. Solid veins
on the underside of the leaf may hold it open. Folded ridges also work, for
example where a fold down the middle also helps long thin leaves. Insect wings
use all three principles for unbeatable lightness and strength.</span></font></p>

<p class="Picturetext"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Fig.
6&nbsp; Achieving rigidity in a light structure</span></font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">People
generally design things to be rigid and unmoving, whilst nature tends to design
things to bend, but not break. Rigidity in structures leads to hot spots of high
internal forces and vulnerability to external forces. With careful design, the
structure may be allowed to move in a way that shifts forces, safely channelling
them into the ground and away from weak points. Thus earthquake-proofed
buildings can move, suspension on vehicles absorb much of the bumping that
plagued earlier rigid carriages. Veterinarian John Dunlop used the flexibility
of a rubber hose to ease the ride of his child’s cycle and thus invented the
pneumatic tyre.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">As
mankind continues to copy nature in our inventions, we are gradually adopting
more flexibility. For example, in the chilly future of smart weapons,
self-steering bullets use contracting tendons to change the direction of the
little nosecone to ensure the bullet hits its mark.</span></font></p>

<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Notice
how we categories objects in terms of how they respond to external forces and
energies: things can be dense or non-dense, hard or soft, rigid or flexible,

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">When
inventing with matter, also think about the forces and energies around your
invention, such as light, heat, gravity and magnetism. How do these affect
things? How can you change the materials used to eliminate undesirable effects?
How materials be used to <i><span style="font-style:italic">take advantage </span></i>of
these effects?</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">A
useful viewpoint is often to zoom into the atomic or molecular level and ask
what is happening here. How are the bonding relationships changing? What is
happening at the surface? Consider the effects between molecules, between atoms
and even within atoms. Are electrons being pulled away by electrostatic or
electromagnetic effects? Are chemical energies being released or absorbed? What
reactions are occurring?</span></font></p>

and space</span></font></b></h2>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Things
use space in different ways. Something with many spikes uses space differently
to something with a smooth surface. A solid object uses space differently to a
hollow object. The gaps and empty spaces in things can be there to make
something lighter (consider all the holes in a chair) or to enable things to fit
together (the hole in a nut is designed so a screw will fit snugly into it).</span></font></p>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Shape</span></font></b></h3>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Think
about the overall shape of your invention. Why is it that way? Nature, again, is
a rich source of stimulation and ideas about shape, from the hooks on burrs to
the hollow bones and feathers of birds.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Shape
has several functions. Firstly, shape connects. The body of a car serves to hold
together all of its parts. Shape also contains and separates, protecting what is
inside or outside from one another’s adverse effects. A house is shaped to
protect its contents from the weather, to contain the heat and with separate
rooms, each with a different use. Shape interfaces with other shapes, like a nut
and bolt fitting together or a bayonet shaped to impale the human body (not all
shapes are good).</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Shape
may have aesthetic functions, too. What makes a Ferrari more attractive than a
Ford? Much of this is to do with shape and the associations we have with it.
Curves, especially in the right proportion, may remind us of the human form.
Sharp angles and unusual shapes may catch our eye and appeal to our sense of
novelty.</span></font></p>

  <p style="border:none;

  the plane is landing, then much more grip is needed to help slow down the
  aeroplane from very high air-speeds. So, I want low grip for take off and high
  grip for landing. I can use an ABS system for landing but this may add weight.
  Can I get grip with little or no extra weight?</span></font></p>
  <p style="border:none;

  next level of questioning is ‘Why does the tyre grip the runway?’ Well, it
  depends in part on the contact between the tyre molecules and the runway
  surface. This is affected by <i><span style="font-style:italic">how much </span></i>tyre
  is touching the runway. So maybe I can have a lot of contact on landing and
  little on take off.</span></font></p>
  <p style="border:none;

</div>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Size</span></font></b></h3>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Things
can be large and small and anywhere in between, although in any application
there tend to be breakpoints and viable ranges along the scale from microscopic
to massive.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">When
size increases, volume and surface area do not change at the same rate. Double
dimensions and the volume goes up by a factor of eight. At a constant density,
this equates to bigger meaning much heavier. It also means greater heat
insulation and retention as heat is lost from the surface, and a deep core will
only change its temperature slowly.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">In
the animal kingdom, it is probably not a coincidence that humans are about half
way along the scale. Small animals find it easier to jump, fall, fly and hide,
whilst larger animals can defeat predators and lose less heat (and so need to
eat less for their size). In the middle, we get the best of both worlds.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">In
the fight against gravity, small wins. A small insect falls more slowly and can
rise more easily. The only problem that it faces is going forward: small wings
need to fight hard against air resistance. Birds have found the best balance
with longer wings and hollow bones.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Flight
is an example where mimicking nature is not necessarily the best answer. Years
of flapping-wing machines proved fruitless. The Wright brothers successfully
took to the air by using large and doubled-up wings to get lift and a powered
propeller to get the extra forward speed needed to get sufficient lift for the
additional weight. Birds learned long ago the balance point between size and
flapping flight. It took man’s ingenuity to overcome the problem of size by
turning it into an advantage: big wings mean lots of lift.</span></font></p>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Boundaries
and corners</span></font></b></h3>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Boundaries
define things. They exist where one thing stops and another thing begins. The
boundary is where interactions occur between the two things, such as
electrolysis, oxidisation, refraction and other effects. Interactions may
involve temperature, physical force, light, chemical reaction or any other
energy system. Larger boundaries usually lead to larger interactive effects,
such as when heat transfer is increased with the greater surface area of a heat
exchanger’s fins.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">The
boundary may have different types of surface texture, being rough, smooth,
hairy, feathery, jagged, and so on. Nature is pretty good at textures, most of
which have highly evolved purposes, from the insulation of hair or feathers to
the sharpness of the different kinds of teeth. We often copy these effects in
our inventions, from the hollow fibres of insulating materials to grinding and
cutting shapes.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Humans
like flat surfaces and they appear everywhere in our world, but nature has
little use for flatness as it is a very weak shape. If you compress a flat
shape, it will either bend or break. We also like sharp corners, which nature
avoids as it knows that this is a point of weakness. Squeeze a folded item and
it will collapse and possibly fracture along the fold, especially if the fold
has a sharp, clean edge. Put a smooth fairing into the corner and its strength
will increase significantly.</span></font></p>

<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">When
inventing with space, consider how space could be added to or taken away from
your device. How will space changes affect its strength? How will it affect its
aesthetic qualities? Architects and top designers make great use of space to
create elegance and style, for which they can charge high fees. Quite literally,
they are selling nothing (although it is a rather <i><span style="font-style:italic">nice
</span></i>nothing).</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Many
shapes are as they are because it is easy to make them that way, rather than
because of how they behave. Edges are straight because it is easy to cut
straight edges. Holes are round because it is easy to drill round holes. Plates
are round because of the rotation of the potter’s wheel. A simple way to
invent is to look at the things around you and ask <i><span style="font-style:italic">why
</span></i>they are shaped that way. Is it is because it was easy to make it
that way or because works best that way?</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Why
is a cup shaped like it is? The edge of the cup from which we drink is round.
Beyond the ease of manufacture and the way that this fits our mouth quite well,
this is also a good shape for controlling the flow rate of the liquid we are
drinking. To get more flow we simply widen our mouths and the flow rate
increases quite quickly. So we can use this shape to drink just a little sip or
to take big gulps. If you have ever drunk from square glasses you will realise
how nice and friendly the round shape is!</span></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Many,
many, many inventions are simply about changing the shape of things to make them
do what they do better. Although the basic idea may be to change the shape, the
critical part of the invention may well be in the manufacturing process, such as
in new milling methods and tools to cut shapes more accurately. The ongoing
improvements in robotics, use of materials and other manufacturing system all
give opportunities to make things differently or more cheaply and thus add
greater value to the finished product.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">If,
when examining an item, you already have the best shape, you can still invent by
asking yourself whether, if it was a different shape, it could be used for
additional functions. For example, you could shape the end of a key to be like a
screwdriver blade. This might result in the problem of the key cutting holes in
your pocket, but rather than reject the whole idea this simply becomes the next
target for innovation.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Play
with space. Look at it as negative matter: how do the spaces between the shapes
alter things? Create virtual space using glass or other transparent and
translucent materials. Change the shape of the space and the space around the
shape. Move around the space: how do things appear from different perspectives?
Zoom in and out, up and down, around and within. See it from your customers’
viewpoint: what does space mean to them? If you are designing books or websites,
look at the balance of white space to text and pictures. Make nothing a tool in
your invention kit.</span></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Surely
time is fixed? It would seem that we cannot change time unless we are thinking
about relativity and make time go slower by moving faster. Time is a
much-ignored resource in inventing, yet is one of our most precious commodities.
Rich or poor, we all have a similarly short span, and the inventions around us
can help or hinder us from making the best of that period.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">When
things happen, they do so in defined order, which we can change. Many designs
are put together as static models before we set them going. We can design in new
ways by asking ourselves if some of the functionality&nbsp; (this word is
important and we will use it a lot) can be delivered at different times. In
computers, magnetic tape allows us to store a lot of information cheaply, but it
is a serial device. Even hard discs and CD-ROMs are have latency and seek-time,
delaying the processor’s request for data. The day that someone invents a
static method of storage that is just as cheap, dense and robust, will be the
day that moving storage will begin to die out.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">We
might want to use something at a given time, but the current situation prevents
us from doing so. Consider drinking a cup of tea or coffee. You may want to
drink it right away, but it is too hot, or you may want to drink it later, but
it has gone cold. Now imagine that you could balance out those two, for example
using some form of heat storage or exchange that removes excess heat from the
delivered liquid when you tip the cup and puts it back in later. Perhaps you
could do this by running the liquid over heat-absorbing surfaces as the cup is
tipped, and returning the stored heat later on into the liquid once it has
cooled down.</span></font></p>

<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Energy
in human situations often translates into effort, enthusiasm and persistence.
Some tasks are just boring, which is a low energy mental state. Inventing with
energy in social situations could means finding ways to make things more

action is eliminated&nbsp; as the pull of enthusiasm is created.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Whenever
we act, we use energy. Can you think of times when you waste energy? Travelling
to work is a big waste for many people. The internet could provide opportunities

can rent space, phones, photocopiers etc.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Sometimes
we would like to use more energy, such as when we are exercising. Charity

feel good about helping those less able than ourselves.</span></font></p>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Matter</span></font></b></h3>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Things
are matter. Inventing with matter means thinking about the tangible things we
use. Non-material invention is more about how we <i><span style="font-style:italic">use</span></i>
things, rather than creating those things. For example, I could invent a new way
of constantly backing up my computer, perhaps by writing a program that
transmits what I type, as I type it, to a remote computer. Then, even if my
house explodes, my work will not be lost!</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">There
are also various forms of ‘virtual matter’ around which you can invent.
These are the intangible things, such as money, computer programs and customer

attention.</span></font></p>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Space</span></font></b></h3>

well do you make use of the space around you? Do you have a loft full of useless
rubbish? How about your garden: is it well laid out? We have three dimensions in
which to play, although we sometimes only use two. A well laid-out garden uses
all dimensions well. Living well includes making good use of the spaces we have
available to us.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Space
is often a critical factor in organisations, where office space is measured in

activity. Moving things and people (ie. travelling) are also about space and can
be very expensive. Space innovations can be about the movement of stock and
parts or about the geographic positioning of facilities, for example in relation
to customers and suppliers.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Other
attributes of space can also be used in non-scientific inventions. Organisations
have shape, functionally, geographically and in other ways. They have boundaries
at which interactions occur with outsiders. You can even use physical metaphors
for social effects, for example the ‘texture’ of a company might describe
its culture (‘Are we bristly when we should be smooth?’).</span></font></p>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Time</span></font></b></h3>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Time
is the one thing that all people have in equal measure, although we do not all
use it in the same way. For busy people, saving time is critical. For those at
leisure, the enjoyment of time is more important. Many service industries are
founded on around time-oriented inventions.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">‘Time
is money’ is a common saying, but it is more true than many realise. We give
our time to an employer, who gives us money. We can then spend that money to
save our own time on activities like growing and cooking food. A trick to invent
around is the speed at which these conversions happen. I would like to make
money quickly, but spend it slowly.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Many
situations can be changed by altering when things happen, and for how long they
happen. Undesirable things, such as cutting the grass, may be put off or done
less often. Desirable things may be done at a time when we are relaxed and more
able to appreciate them.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Doing
things at the same time allows bad things to be completed at once or good things
to be intensified, such as theatres have combined with restaurants to extend an
evening’s pleasure. Or we can spread things out or book concerts months ahead
so we can look forward to them for a longer time.</span></font></p>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">In
combination, these four science principles can be very useful. For example, we
can consider how time may be traded off against space, or how things may be done
using less energy. When we are concerned with how and when things are moved, and
the time factors involved, we are using all four science principles.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">New
investment methods could be invented by considering how money may be
automatically moved around, over time, in the virtual space of world banking
systems. Looking at how and when people meet, and the energies of their
interactions, could improve whole societies.</span></font></p>

some simple science is a powerful thing. So is remembering that most (if not
all) great innovations came from people who were either outside or new to the

them.</span></font></p>

<h1 align="left" style="text-align:left"><b><font size="5" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:18.0pt;">A
Science Lens</span></font></b></h1>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">In
the previous chapter we took a basic review of science, looking at it through
the lenses of energy and force, matter, space and time. In this chapter we
continue our challenging journey showing how we can look afresh and in detail at
a single scientific principle, for which we have chosen friction.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Please
note that this is not intended as a complete treatise on the subject nor does it
cover all parts of science. What it does aim to do is indicate how you can look
at scientific subjects in simple, unscientific and unconventional ways that
allow you to see things differently and consequently make use of them in your
inventions.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Friction
might be considered as being well understood, but scientists are still debating
this point. In fact, as with pressure, it can be said that that friction doesn’t
exist! This may seem to be a rather alarming statement, but let us consider the
real situation. In fact we will use friction as a particular example of looking
in detail at what at first may seem to be a simple and well-understood problem.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">If
you have a bowl of fruit and you want to invent a way of making it more green,
you could think of is as an ‘inventing with light’ problem and, before
thinking about what you might change, ask what kinds of different light there
is. For example, you could make it more green by adding green things to the
bowl, you could remove some of the red and yellow fruit, or you could even put
it next to a green plant.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Friction
is like the colour in the fruit bowl: it is made up of several different things.
To change friction, we need to identify and understand these different
components.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">A
good, creative starting point is to review the definition and get a fresh view
of the problem. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary describes it as ‘resistance
a body encounters in moving over another.’ So it is about what stops things
that are in contact with one another from moving relative to one another.</span></font></p>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Bounce</span></font></b></h3>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Think
of a heavy supermarket trolley going over rough concrete. Although the wheels
help you move it, the trolley still has to rise and fall over the bumps, and the
size and shape of the bumps will change how much force you need overall to move
the trolley forwards.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Now
zoom into the microscopic view of a block of wood being pushed along a table
(Fig 15). The same thing is happening! The molecules from the wood and the table
are snagging against one another making the wood bounce imperceptibly on its
way. With a larger, heavier block of wood, you might be able to feel the
juddering. All surfaces have some bumps, unless they are so fine they have one
nearly smooth layer of atoms (and then other factors, such as electrostatic
forces, are important).</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">So
a way of reducing friction is to smooth out the bumps. Oil partly works this
way, filling in the gaps between the bumps. Sometimes, you may want to increase
the friction, such as when you need a rug to stay where it is and not slide
across the floor. In either case, you may want to change the size and shape of
the bumps or the effect they have, both on the thing that is being pushed and on
the surface on which it is moving.</span></font></p>

<p class="Picturetext"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Fig.

<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Elasticity</span></font></b></h3>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">When
two objects try to move against each other, if one has parts which will move
elastically then it may effectively reduce resistance as the flexible parts of
the surface bend around and over the bumps on the other surface rather than
having to bounce over them.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Consider
pushing a heavy box across a wooden floor. The box bounces along awkwardly with
plenty of frictional resistance. If we took a piece of carpet, turned it upside
down and put the box on top, now the flexible hairs on the carpet would fit into
the gaps between the bumps, smoothing the ride and making the box easier to
push.</span></font></p>
<p class="Picture"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt"><img width="401" height="86" src="image032.gif"></span></font></p>
<p class="Picturetext"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Fig.
16 Using elasticity to smooth the ride</span></font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Now
consider what would happen if we now had to push the box (with the carpet
attached) across a carpet. The two sets of hair in the carpet would now
entangle, actually increasing the friction. The algebra of this is as follows:</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bumps + Bumps = Friction</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bumps + Elasticity = Less friction</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Elasticity + Elasticity = More friction!</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">To
increase or decrease friction, consider the elasticity in both surfaces.&nbsp;
Think about how easy or not it is to move a vacuum cleaner around the house.
Over carpet, a smooth metal plate would be the best bottom surface, over a
smooth floor a bristle surround would be better. The whole picture is
complicated by the fact that you have air flowing between the surfaces, but the
principles are clear.</span></font></p>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Fracturing</span></font></b></h3>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">For
some surfaces, the problem with lack of smoothness is overcome by the fact that
molecules or even lumps of molecules will crack and break off as you move
objects against each other. If you start sanding a piece of wood the first push
may be hard but it soon gets easier as the surfaces are broken down to become
smoother. The bits that are broken off also fill the holes, serving as an added
lubricant; it is only when you blow the sanded wood particles away that you find
out how truly smooth the wood has become.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Thus
another way to increase or decrease friction is to find ways in which you can
increase or decrease the ease of breaking off small pieces of surface. Making
things colder or hotter is one way, as this will change the brittleness of the
materials. A special example would be ice, as this is complicated by the fact
that the ice will melt in places to give you a liquid lubricant.</span></font></p>
<p class="Picture"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt"><img width="419" height="99" src="image034.gif"></span></font></p>
<p class="Picturetext"><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Fig.
17&nbsp; Fracturing pieces to smooth and reduce bounce</span></font></b></p>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">The
first three features of friction we have discussed (bounce, elasticity and
fracturing) are to do with larger mechanical forces. These can be understood
simply by drawing rough surfaces on a large scale and asking yourself what
happens to objects moving past each other. For the next three features we are
going to move closer in to the molecular level.</span></font></p>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Electrostatic
action</span></font></b></h3>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">When
molecules of two objects are in contact then some of the forces between them
will be electrostatic. Electrons will be held in position and have a force
between them and other positive charges in the molecules (protons) of the other
object. There are technical names for the different ways this happens (Covalent
bonds, Metallic bonds, Hydrogen bonds and van der Waal forces). What is
happening depends on whether the electrons are held specifically between two
molecules or are held generally in the electrical field created by many
molecules. An easy way to think of this is by imagining a crowded party. You may
have difficulty moving between people because of the general need to push people
around to make space for yourself or you may need to break apart hands which are
holding onto each other. So molecules may just occupy a crowded electrical space
or they may be holding tight and the bonds need breaking.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;What
is really going on is very complicated but for inventions we might be able to
simply think about what we might do to a surface to increase or decrease the
friction from electrostatic forces.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">For
example, we could deliberately charge up the surfaces, placing electrons on or
near the surface. We can alter the field reaction between the objects if they
can carry a charge, we can even make the force a magnetic attraction. We can
also change how much hand holding there is by changing the properties of the
materials (with additives or new materials).</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">We
should be aware that if we make our surface smoother then more molecules are
getting close to other molecules, which could increase the forces of attraction
between them, hence making friction greater. So we can see that although making
surfaces smoother reduces friction by reducing bounce, shearing and elastic
bending it increases friction through greater electrostatic forces.</span></font></p>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Viscosity</span></font></b></h3>
<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Imagine
pushing a brick across a treacle-covered kitchen table. It would not be an easy
slide. But what if you replaced the treacle with engine oil? The brick’s
journey would now be much smoother. So what is going on? How does a lubricant
act to reduce the work of brick-pushing?</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">One
thing a lubricant does is to keep apart by a small distance the surface
molecules of the brick and the table. By keeping them apart we can reduce the
bounce needed (they ride smoothly on the wave of liquid), reduce the need to
fracture on the surface, reduce the elastic bending of bits that protrude, and
reduce the electrostatic forces.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">The
difference between the oil and the treacle is how easily the molecules <i><span style="font-style:italic">within
</span></i>the lubricant move relative to one another (because the electrostatic
forces are really weak). This kind of ‘internal friction’ is viscosity of
the liquid. In a really good lubricant, the molecules bond better to the brick
and the table than they do to one another.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Now
imagine something that has <i><span style="font-style:italic">really </span></i>weak
attraction between the molecules (they could even be repel one another). This
sounds very much like a gas. If you can keep the bodies apart, gas is an
excellent lubricator, as Sir Christopher Cockerell, the inventor of the
hovercraft, well knew.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Think
about a jar of jam. Inside you have a wide blade and you want to stir the jam.
If the opening in the pot of jam is much larger than the size of the blade when
you stir, it is easy for the molecules to move as they have lots of places to
go.&nbsp; They can move to the biggest gaps. When the space available is limited
they are harder to push around. The same is true if you want to move people
around in a crowded room! So when you have a very smooth surface against another
very smooth surface the viscosity can go up a lot because the molecules do not
have much room to move around. Thinking creatively means using principles of
friction and viscosity in situations where others would not, but which will lead
to real insights.</span></font></p>
<h3><b><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt">Gravity</span></font></b></h3>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Gravity
would seem to be a significant factor in friction, as this is what makes the
block heavy, but thinking differently about this shows that is it not that
important.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">First
of all, there will be some gravitational attraction between two objects which
will have a small part to play in how you can separate them. But it is so small
that it is usually not worth considering.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">But
surely gravity plays big part in how difficult it is to move one object against
another? This may seem to be true, but is only indirectly so. The weight of an
object does not make it difficult to move, but it does change how the other
forces above are working. For a heavy object the surfaces are pressed together
more, requiring more fracturing to get things started and more bounce to keep it
going.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Gravity
is a contributor to the effects of friction, but it is not the real culprit and
we need to be careful about how we treat this weighty subject.</span></font></p>

  a certain temperature it will go solid when under pressure. Why? Well,
  eventually there is just not enough space for the molecules to move around and
  they end up&nbsp; binding to one another.</span></font></p>

  water is funny. Icebergs are funny because they float. They float because when
  water freezes it takes up more space (volume) not less as most things do. Just
  the way the molecules bind together!</span></font></p>
  <p style="border:none;

  when you press on ice hard enough it melts! But it needs a lot of pressure.
  You might think that this pressure is why ice skates work, with the pressure
  melting just a little bit of ice to make a smooth lubricator. In fact the
  slipperiness of ice is cause by curious behaviour of a very fine surface layer
  of molecules.</span></font></p>

  if you are inventing with water and ice just watch out, as you may get the
  unexpected (which is always an opportunity for more invention!).</span></font></p>

<p class="NormalNonindent"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">The
ideas we have discussed above are not presented as the high science of friction,
but a surprising number of things you can make will require some thinking about
how well parts hold on to, or let go of, other parts. Whether you bolt, screw,
glue, weld or fasten pieces together, you should think about the potential of
changing how you do this using the considerations above.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Think
of it as a ‘what if?’ checklist. Can you invent better ways of connecting
parts? If so you may be able to produce a much better design. Many things we use
do not have good friction properties. Things stick when we want them to glide
and slip when we want them to stick. Things break apart and they should stay
together, or refuse to come apart when we want to separate them. Invention
opportunities abound for the observant.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt">Just
for fun, have a look around the supermarket and look at how produce is sealed
into bags, boxes and tubs. Look at how many devices there are and think bout how
well they work. Do you buy things in bags and then have trouble getting them to
open? Bottles for pills are a good example of good and bad design as they are
specifically designed to so that children cannot open them (but they often can)
and adults can (but often cannot). Can you think of better designs using the
ideas about friction above?</span></font></p>
