words:&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></i></b>Technology forecasting, technology evolution,
TRIZ, process improvement, product development</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">TRIZ (The
acronym in Russian for “Theory of Inventive Problem Solving” was introduced
to the engineering and product development communities outside the former USSR
beginning in the mid-1980’s, with the emigration of some TRIZ practitioners
and the availability of the first translations. (Ref. 1.)&nbsp; Early versions
of some of the software tools attracted interest in the early 90’s, and&nbsp;
in the late 90’s we are seeing rapid spread of awareness of TRIZ in technical
communities, as measured by the publications and meetings, and the inclusion of
TRIZ in the agendas of the Project Management Institute, the International
Congress on the Management of Engineering Technology, the Quality Function
Deployment Symposium, the Total Product Development Symposium, the Society of
Automotive Engineers, the Institute for Mechanical Engineering (UK), World
Quality Day&nbsp; (Finland), etc., as well as the growth of TRIZ specialty
meetings in the US and in Europe(Ref. 2).&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Much of
the early emphasis in TRIZ in the West has been on problem solving, replicating
the history of the development of TRIZ in the former USSR.&nbsp; (Ref. 3,
4.)&nbsp; Although the patterns of evolution (or the “Laws” and “lines”
of evolution, depending on the translation used—see Ref. 5) were recognized
for their power, they were principally used as adjunct problem solving
tools.&nbsp; This is “tactical” TRIZ—it is used to improve one product or
process.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">“Strategic”
TRIZ is the use of TRIZ methods to change a product line, a company’s
long-term business plan, or the direction of an industry.&nbsp; We are now
beginning to see strategic methods derived from TRIZ technology forecasting,
which have been given names such as Guided Development (Ref. 6),&nbsp; and
Directed Evolution (Ref. 3) and other changes in the TRIZ patterns of evolution
(Ref. 7) in the English-language TRIZ literature.&nbsp; Since TRIZ is a
technical system, these changes should come as no surprise, and, in fact, should
fit the TRIZ patterns of evolution. Preliminary attempts to fit the changes in
TRIZ to the S-Curve (or technology maturity curve, as shown in Figure 1.) have
been made (Ref. 3) but there has&nbsp; been no agreement on what function or
functional parameter should be measured.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">These new
methods use the same&nbsp; fundamental research on the world collection of
patents that is the basis for much of TRIZ, but propose different methodologies
for the use of the data.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of these methods will&nbsp; need to be
tested and validated.&nbsp;&nbsp; The methods of experimental science have been
used to test each of the additions to TRIZ; that is, the new method is proposed,
a number of TRIZ practioners test the new methods against a variety of cases,
and, if the new method proves better than the old, it is adopted.&nbsp; (This is
the method that was used as each new version of ARIZ was introduced, per Ref.
3)&nbsp; “Better” has been defined as more reliable, more reproducible
(different practioners all get the same result)&nbsp; easier to use, producing
results that the client likes, etc.&nbsp; As with any experimental science that
relies on case studies, there is no one moment at which one can say that a new
method has been proven, but as a preponderance of evidence accumulates,
practioners will move to using the new methods, and teachers will start teaching
it, and it will become the mainstream method.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Figure
1.</b> Derived from Ref. 1.&nbsp; This shows the situation where the new
technology is superior in the measured functional capability from its first
introduction.&nbsp; Examples would include the clarity of digital cellular
phones compared to analog cellular phones, or the number of colors represented
by color television compared to black and white.&nbsp; In other situations, the
new technology is inferior to the old (clarity of a color TV picture relative to
a black and white picture, etc.) and the second curve starts below the first.
Some researchers have attempted to show the progress of TRIZ itself on such a
graph (Ref. 3) but the measured function that is improving has not been
quantified.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">The
general method of TRIZ technology forecasting is as follows:&nbsp;</font></p>

    the history of the system.&nbsp; Construct the S-curves for all important
    functions.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Apply
    the Patterns of Evolution and the Lines of Evolution to forecast system
    changes.&nbsp; Depending on which references and translations you use, there
    are 8 or 11 patterns of evolution, and 230-340 lines of
    evolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Directed Evolution method (Ref. 3) this
    step includes assessment of steps that were skipped in the history of the
    system, and deciding whether to explore the alternatives that the skipped
    steps would open up.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Formulate
    the problems that must be solved to achieve the changes to reach the Ideal
    Final Result, my means of the Lines of Evolution that best fit the

</ol>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Recent
case studies have shown that the correlation between the S-curves for functional
capability (Step 2), number of inventions, and level of inventions first
demonstrated by Altshuller (Ref. 1) continue to be validated in a wide variety
of technologies.&nbsp; The following papers give extensive data and reviews of
several methods of gathering the data and assessing the level of inventions:</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">These
correlations are&nbsp; shown in Fig. 2.&nbsp; They are a practical tool that
many companies are using to assess the maturity of their technologies.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">These
maturity assessments can be essential for major strategic decisions on the
future of a product or a product line.&nbsp; Failure to recognize the onset of
maturity can lead to failure to invest in new technologies, and continuation of
the attempts to get more from a system that has reached its limit.&nbsp;
Likewise, jumping from birth stage to a new curve can forgo the process and
product improvements and increased market of the growth stage.</font></p>

2.</span></b>&nbsp;The correlations between the Functional Capability, Level of
Innovation, and Number of Innovations, first observed by Altshuller. (Ref.
1)&nbsp; Altshuller’s curve for profitability is not included here, since
different industries each have different curves for profitability vs. time.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">My own
observation in companies in numerous industries (truck parts, military software,
chemical processing, food packaging, medical devices, cleaning products, etc.)
is that people will do an initial assessment of the maturity of their products
based on the current emotional state of the people working on the product.&nbsp;
If the people&nbsp; are excited, they will place their product in the “growth”
stage.&nbsp; If they are frustrated, they will place it in the “maturity”
stage.&nbsp; They will only have a clear picture of the state of maturity after
they do the hard work of finding the data in their own records and in the
publications of their industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Many
organizations have begun to see strategic value in supply chain management; that
is, the integration of all their suppliers and their customers into a continuous
stream of value added processes. (Refs. 12, 13, 14, 15.)&nbsp; TRIZ technology
forecasting methods can be used in conjunction with supply chain management as
follows:</font></p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Evaluate
    your organization’s key technologies using the methods cited above</font></li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Where
    parts, processes, or subsystems are supplied by outside firms, work with
    them to evaluate the technology maturity, and the probable future paths of
    those technologies.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Decide
    if the suppliers are capable of carrying out the strategic plan.&nbsp; If
    they are, continue to work with them on technology evolution.&nbsp; If not,
    decide whether to invest in them (either financially or technologically or
    both) to make them capable, or whether to seek other means (other suppliers,
    internal sources, etc.)</font></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">This
strategic use of TRIZ is in its infancy, and there are no published case
studies, since the companies that are using it are deriving considerable
proprietary advantage from it.&nbsp; This method should be subjected to the same
experimental tests suggested above, to see if it is successful for practioners
using TRIZ methods in many industries.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Similarly,
TRIZ technology forecasting assessment of the customers’ technology can be
used both tactically, to decide when to introduce a product or process so that
the customer will be ready to receive it (Ref. 16) or strategically, to decide
to market the product to non-traditional customers. (Ref. 17)&nbsp; In both of
these situations, the power of TRIZ is that it provides a means for quantifying
the decisions that earlier strategy and marketing methods treated
intuitively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><b><i><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Conclusion:</span></font></i></b></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">The TRIZ
technology forecasting methods are used for tactical and strategic decision
making.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; methods of application are evolving rapidly.&nbsp;
The original methods have stood the test of time and the tests of application to
new industries that were not included in the original data base.&nbsp; They are
also proving themselves in application to supplier and customer
technologies.&nbsp; The new methods will require similar extensive testing to
discover their benefits and their limits.</font></p>
