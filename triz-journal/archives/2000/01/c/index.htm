<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Lev Shulyak was a
TRIZ teacher, consultant, and translator.&nbsp; He was the founder of the
Technical Innovation Center of Worcester, MA, USA.&nbsp; Lev was the principal
translator of Genrich Altshuller’s books <i><span style="font-style:italic">Suddenly
the Inventor Appeared, 40 Principles,</span></i> and<i><span style="font-style:italic">&nbsp;
The Innovation Algorithm.&nbsp; </span></i>Through these books, he introduced
many of the TRIZ practioners in the English-speaking world to Altshuller’s
work and his imagination.&nbsp; Lev added a measure of his own charm to the
retelling of Altshuller’s stories, and he helped many of us understand TRIZ as
a way of thinking.&nbsp; He was the founder and first president of the
Altshuller Institute, dedicated to educating people about TRIZ and Altshuller’s
work.&nbsp; Just a few days ago, he sent a president’s message to the members,
reporting on the first year’s successes, and plans for the second year.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">As editor of The TRIZ
Journal I started receiving remembrances of Lev as soon as the word went out on
the TRIZ listbot and to the members of the Altshuller Institute.&nbsp; A few of
the tributes are quoted here:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Jim Kowalick:</b>&nbsp;
Lev really played a major role in introducing TRIZ to the west - in largest</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">part perhaps because
of his Altshuller translations.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; He was the mediator and diplomat
who brought together several TRIZ comrades and groups who ordinarily would not
have naturally come together.&nbsp; He was an organizer (books; conferences;
institutes; etc.).&nbsp; He</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">will be missed.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Noel Leon Rovira: </b>
Although I only had the opportunity to meet Lev once, during TRIZCON99, I
realized that he was the right leader for the Altshuller Institute.&nbsp; He
contributed to spread the seeds of TRIZ throughout the world. His enthusiasm and
support of the Institute has helped us to continue working on the goals of the
Institute.&nbsp; We will miss you Lev.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Don Masengale:&nbsp;
</b>He will join Altshuller and other kind hearted souls that preceded him, who
endeavored to help other's learn the secrets of thinking. He will be sorely
missed, for all that he was, for all that he did, and for all that he
touched.&nbsp; His work in &quot;Westernizing&quot; TRIZ will be one of his more
important his legacies.&nbsp; ... [Lev] generously and sincerely shared his
experiences and knowledge.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Toru Nakagawa:</b>
The tragic news that Mr. Lev Shulyak passed away on Dec. 22 has given a sad and
painful shock to us Japanese TRIZ learners/practitioners, too. His English
translation of Altshuller's textbooks have been further translated and published
in Japanese, and are serving as the principal references on TRIZ in Japan.&nbsp;
Everybody who got interested in TRIZ in Japan has read these textbooks to study
the original ideas of TRIZ as written by the Founder. Together with many
Japanese readers of Lev's TRIZ textbooks, I miss Mr. Lev Shulyak and will
memorize his devotion.</font></p>
