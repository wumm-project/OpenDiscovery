</span>Concept Generation using Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, TRIZ</span></b></font></p>

</span><i><span style="font-style: italic">Introduction</span></i></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">TRIZ,
pronounced &quot;trees&quot;, is the Russian acronym for Theory of Inventive
Problem Solving. TRIZ is used to assist those that must be innovative or
creative in their field. Put simply, TRIZ uses a number of tools to make
innovation methodological and systematic. The view of creativity as being an
erratic or random event no longer exists for TRIZ users. Three ideals structure
TRIZ theory: 1) the ideal design is the desired end result, 2) contradictions
assist problem solutions, and 3) innovation can be an organized systematic
process. TRIZ moves innovative thought away from being an art and toward a
science.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Genrich
Altshuller, a Russian scientist, began developing TRIZ in 1946 while he was a
patent clerk. While reviewing patents he found patterns and commonalties in the
solutions given. Initially, Altschuller reviewed some 40,000 patents. Over time
more than four million patents from the world patent base have been reviewed.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Altschuller
discovered that there was a finite problem set within the patent base that could
be defined when the patent's technical language was reduced into generic terms.
These problems fall into three classifications: technical, physical, and
administrative. He also realized that there were a finite number of solutions
for the problem set. While many of these solutions varied across different
fields of research, the methods applied were the same. These findings developed
into what is known today as Contradiction Theory.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Altshuller's
third discovery was that there common patterns in the evolution of technical
systems. He found that the subsequent development of a system after it was first
invented had a number of similar stages. The tools derived from this discovery
became known as the patterns of evolution.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Trial
and error methods are the most inefficient techniques for generating innovative
solutions in comparison to TRIZ methods. Inventing using trial and error can use
a vast amount of resources such as time, effort, and money. Even worse than the
use of resources is the unpredictability. One trial could be performed before a
solution is found, which is unlikely, or there could be literally thousands of
trials with no acceptable solution. An analogy to using trial and error methods
is baking a cake multiple times to perfect it instead of using the cookbook
which is TRIZ.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Paradigms
are a negative result of the psychological inertia of an inventor. Removing the
paradigms set over time through experience was a goal of Altshuller. Problem
solving paradigms can be viewed as tools in the toolbox of an inventor. The size
of the toolbox is dependent on the experience of the inventor. The problem
associated with using this toolbox is that no matter how intelligent, wise, or
talented the inventor, the size of the toolbox is limited. If the inventor's
paradigms are temporarily dropped, the use of TRIZ allows them to use knowledge
built in the world patent data base from thousands of inventors over hundreds of
years. This removes the inventor from his/her current knowledge base and into
the entire world’s knowledge.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Work
on TRIZ is continued today outside of Russia in the US and the rest of the
world. Many tools and theories have been developed in addition to Contradiction
Theory, including Ideality, Functional Diagramming, Su-Field Analysis, ARIZ,
Patterns of Evolution, and Anticipatory Failure Determination™ Ideation
Corporation. All of these tools will be discussed in the next chapter. Ideality,
Functional Diagramming, and Contradiction Theory will be emphasized because of
their use in the boarding automation project. The last part of this section,
3.3.6, will discuss the implementation of TRIZ in the boarding automation
research.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman"><i><span style="font-style: italic">3.3.2.<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Ideality</span></i></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">In
1956, researchers formalized the observation that designs evolve over time to
the ideal solution. Most people would initially define the ideal solution as
using the least energy, having the fewest parts, causing the least amount of
friction, etc. If these definitions were taken a step further the ideal design
would provide the function while not being physically present at all. The ideal
design satisfies all the requirements of the customer by using already available
resources. This theory of driving toward the ideal solution with intention
became known as Ideality.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Ideality
can also be defined in mathematical terms:<br>
Ideality = (Sum of Useful Effects) / (Sum of Harmful Effects +
Cost)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3.1)</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">This
equation can be used in combination with functional diagrams to express a level
of Ideality. It can be seen that either increasing the numerator or decreasing
the denominator or by changing the relative growth rate can influence the level
of Ideality. Decreasing the denominator, or removing harmful effects, is the
most beneficial change to the system. Increasing the number of useful functions
to increase Ideality may results in increased use of resources.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">There
are two approaches for obtaining a near ideal design: Use of Resources and Use
of Effects. Resources, in this case, are substances or fields that are readily
available. They can be used in combination or independently to accomplish the
desired function. Available resources include energy reserves, free time, and
unused or empty space [6]. Effects can be physical, chemical, and geometric.
Effects can also be described as natural phenomena such as hot air rising,
thermal expansion of materials, and gravity. Of course, most of these effects
are unknown to any one scientist because they cross fields and backgrounds.
There are more than 250 physical effects, 120 chemical effects, and 50 geometric
effects. Over three thousand different effects have been identified to date.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Each
of the six paths, listed below, provide a means for moving towards Ideality.</font></p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Exclude
    auxiliary functions</font></li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Exclude
    elements</font></li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Identify
    self-service</font></li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Replace
    elements, parts or total system</font></li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Change
    the principle of operation</font></li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Utilize
    resources</font></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Initially
it appears that the theory of Ideality would be extremely helpful when trying to
redesign an existing system. However, Ideality, has direct applications in the
initial stage of design. Considering how to implement available resources and
natural occurrences will surely improve the design process. Setting goals, such
as a certain weight or cost, other than ideal will eventually limit the
designer.</font></p>

</span>Problem Formulation - Functional Diagramming</span></i></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Functional
Diagrams are simple cause and effect graphs used to show the interactions
between process functions or product parts or a mixture of each. The definition
of the functional diagrams remains loose so that the user may mold the problem
into a useful and helpful form.&nbsp; Diagrams can have varying hierarchies.
They may be very large and complex if the user desires, encompassing every
&quot;nut and bolt&quot; or can remain simple, containing only the surface
functions of the system.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Traditional
TRIZ tools did not include functional diagrams. Later, in 1992, Zusman and
Zlotin added &quot;Formulator&quot;™ Ideation Corp. [6] to assist in the use
of traditional TRIZ tools such as Contradiction Theory. Since 1992 software
forms have been added for easier charting.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0" align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="image002.jpg" width="480" height="246"></font>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">elements
may be harmful or useful. Useful functions may have varying degrees of
capability ranging from insufficient to excessive. A component of a machine
could be a mounting plate. A useful action of that component could be that it
holds another component in place. It could have the harmful effect of placing
excessive gravitational load on the mechanism moving the component. A
supersystem element is an element that impacts the system that is beyond the
control of the designer. The product is the result of the process. Figure 3-6,
below,&nbsp; is a functional diagram of a typical system.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><i><span style="font-style: italic"><font face="Times New Roman">Figure
3-6: Typical Functional Diagram</font></span></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Gaining
a deeper understanding of a system can often solve many problems without
employing additional tools.&nbsp; A powerful use of functional diagrams is
system comprehension through reviewing component connections and
relations.&nbsp; Quality Function Deployment and Analytical Hierarchy Process
can be used in combination with functional diagrams to identify the most
important technical problems. Communication can also become greatly enhanced
because the system is shown in an easy viewed graphical format.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">When
the system is fully understood, simplification should begin. Trimming is the
process of removing components and actions. Trimming moves the product/process
closer to the Ideal Final Result. Removing harmful actions would be the biggest
benefit to a system. Harmful action should be eliminated, reduced, or prevented
using traditional science. If the action may not be removed, there may be a way
to benefit from it. Useful actions and thus components should be removed by
finding alternative actions. Finding an alternative method may remove multiple
unnecessary functions. If no better alternative solution is known, a way to
enhance the action or component should be researched.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Contradictions
may be seen easily using diagrams. Any component that is required for a useful
action but also causes a harmful action is a contradiction as shown in Figure
3-6. Contradiction Theory, discussed in the next section, can be used to find a
solution that will cause no harmful effect.</font></p>

</span>Contradiction Theory</span></i></b></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Contradiction
Theory was one of the first tools developed by Genrich Altshuller. Using this
tool will allow the user to generate multiple solutions to any given
contradiction. Contradictions are split into three categories: physical,
technical, and administrative. The first two types of contradictions will be
covered in the following paragraphs while the third, administrative does not
apply TRIZ tools. A typical administrative contradiction would be a need for a
larger budget while little cash is available.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Physical
contradictions exist when there is some part of a design, system, product, etc.
where two conflicting states are desired simultaneously. For instance a soft
drink bottle should be, both large and small; large for capacity and small for
ease of transportation.&nbsp; A consumer could also desire a stove that is hot
to heat food and yet also cold to the touch for safety purposes.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Three
separation principles are used to solve physical contradictions: separation in
time, space, and scale. In the soft drink example, separation in time can be
used. If the container were collapsible it could be large at one time, during
use, and small at another time, when transported. Separation principles are
generally the first tools employed after a system has been diagrammed and the
problems are well understood.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">A
technical contradiction arises when traditional science or engineering is used
to improve one aspect of a system while reducing the desirability of another
aspect. Eliminating contradictions innovatively means there will be no loss in
performance or properties for an improvement in other properties. A classic
example of a technical contradiction is when increases in strength of a material
come coupled with increases in size and weigh. Resolving the contradiction would
provide a strong, lightweight, compact material.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">It
is important to note the difference between innovative problems and design,
engineering, or technical problems. Inventors solve problems by eliminating
contradictions. Problems that lack physical or technical contradictions should
be solved by designers, engineers, technicians, etc. using traditional
engineering methods. It is the job of the designer, engineer, or technician to
apply the innovative concept, found by the inventor, to a product, process, or
system.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Any
technical contradiction that could occur will be between any two of the set of
39 parameters (properties) that Altshuller has identified. Examples of these
parameters are 'weight', 'temperature', 'reliability', 'adaptability', and
'productivity' [6]. Altshuller found that a contradiction between any two of the
parameters was solved with an innovative solution. He also found that the
methods used to acquire a solution to the contradictions were definable. Forty
methods, called principles, were discovered within the patents that include
methods such as 'segmentation' (dividing an object into parts), 'use of
mechanical vibration', and 'nesting' (contain an object within another) [6]. A
contradiction matrix was formed in which principles are listed that have
commonly been used to solve the given contradiction.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">At
first, contradiction theory sounds as if it were the panacea of the innovative
world. The fact is that the most difficult work comes before and after the
theory is used. Figure 3-7 shows the process of identifying a problem and
carrying that through the theory to a solution.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0" align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="image003.gif" style="text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0" width="558" height="309"></font>

3-7: Process for Employing Contradiction Theory</font></span></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">When
a contradiction is identified it is normally stated in technical terms, specific
to the field where it came from. The technical terms must be translated into
generic terms so that the parameters can be selected. Representing the
contradiction in generic terms may require a broad definition of a parameter.
The computer term baud rate (bits/second) would be translated as the parameter
speed.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Once
a principle has been identified it must be applied to the specific problem
becoming a specific solution. None of the principles can be used alone to solve
a difficult problem. A technique may have been identified but it must be applied
in a way that improves on the original system. A great deal of thought,
creativity, and experience is required during this stage.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Contradiction
Theory is the basis of many of the other TRIZ tools some of which will be
discussed in the next section.</font></p>

</span>Other TRIZ Tools</span></i></b></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">This
section will give a brief overview of some TRIZ tools other than those already
discussed. These tools, which are less used and generally more complex include:
Substance - Field Analysis, ARIZ, and Patterns of Evolution.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Substance-Field
(Su-Field) Analysis should be used in situations where a problem is well
formulated. Every Su-Field Model will contain at least two substances and at
least one field. The terms substances and fields are used very loosely. Output
from the system originates from a substance that is acted upon by another
substance. A field, or energy source, typically acts on both substances and
causes the output. Substances can be simple building blocks or complex systems.
Fields may range anywhere from gravitational forces to nuclear reactions. After
a system has been modeled the designer can identify complete, incomplete,
ineffective, and/or harmful components on which to concentrate. A typical
Substance-Field diagram can be seen below in Figure 3-8.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">ARIZ
is the Russian acronym for Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving. ARIZ uses the
other TRIZ tools in combination to identify contradictions and model problems.
ARIZ is only required for about 5% of all TRIZ practices because of its extreme
level of detail (2). The first version of ARIZ only contained about five steps
but over time as TRIZ theories were better understood it has evolved to a point
now in which it is comprises approximately 100 steps.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">One
of Altshuller's original discoveries was that designs evolved in the same way as
other designs starting from conception and ending at death. Eight particular
patterns were recognized and today are the part of TRIZ called Patterns of
Technical Evolution. Patterns of Evolution should be used by an organization
when they wish to gain a technological advantage over the competition. The eight
patterns are as follows:</font></p>
</p><ol>
  <li>

</span>TRIZ Application</span></i></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">TRIZ
is a tool used to aid the engineer, designer, etc. in solving problems
innovatively and creatively. Functional diagramming and Contradiction Theory
were the two parts of TRIZ most applied to this project. The implementation of
these tools in this project will be discussed here.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman"><i><span style="font-style: italic">3.3.6.1.<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Functional Diagramming</span></i></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Functional
diagrams were used in this research as simple cause and effect graphs, showing
the functional interactions between parts. Many gains can be reaped from
functional diagrams. Three benefits were fully realized during this project. The
first advantage is identifying harmful effects and their implications. Harmful
effects in functional diagrams are often technical contradictions. The second
advantage is obtaining opportunities for part removal, which is also called
trimming. Lastly, after reviewing the problem in a graphical form, the entire
system was comprehended more thoroughly.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">The
entire automatic boarding machine was split into four subsystems: 'transfer',
'opening', 'loading', and 'board support'. Functional diagrams for these
subsytems can be seen in the Appendix sections A.3 through A.6 respectively. The
'transfer' subsystem transports a loose, unoriented sock to the 'opening'
subsystem. The 'opening' subsystem orients, opens, and places the sock in
position to be loaded onto the board. The 'loading' subsystem places the sock on
the board. The 'board stabilizer' subsystem accurately aligns the board with the
loading assembly's sock loading fingers.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Trimming
is the process of examining the system and removing parts. Parts are “trimmed”
by identifying other componentsor freely available resources that can supply the
function of the part to be trimmed. Transferring the function of the part
removes the necessity for that part. Ideality and trimming are closely related
as one can see from Equation 3.1. Removing a part from a system will result in
lower cost, which raises the Ideality of the system. The following is an
application of trimming from this research. The change in Ideality of the system
will also be shown.</font></p>

Rollers are used for conveyor belts that transfer the sock to the opening stage.
Roller bearings are used to support and rotate the conveyor belt rollers. In the
original design, the bearings are mounted in a housing that is attached to the
frame by mounting screws. The housing tends to slip, (harmful effect), on the
frame surface after time because of the vibration from rotation of the bearing
and rod. Figure 3-9 shows the solid model of the bearing-roller subsystem.
Figure 3-10 shows the functional diagrams of the subsystem before and after
trimming.</font></p>

improve the Ideality. It was identified that the frame could supply the function
of the bearing housing and the button cap screws by acting as the stabilizer and
mount. The harmful action of the bearing housing slipping on the frame will also
be removed because the bearing will be constrained by the frame. Figures 3-10

<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">The
number of parts used in this assembly was far too large for the purpose it
served. The functionality of the stabilizer was also deemed insufficient because
boards that were bent above the stabilizing assembly would not be aligned
properly. The stabilizer mechanism has no effect on the board above the
assembly. This fact is compounded for taller boards. Figure 3-13 is a functional
diagram of the board stabilizer showing how many components are used to simply
align the board.</font></p>

There are many places where one could begin trimming parts from this assembly.
Rollers will continue to be used as the aligning system because of their ease of
use, low cost, and availability. Using only one rolling mechanism on each side
of the assembly instead of using the current two bearings will remove two parts.
Using a longer roller will have the same effect as using two bearings that are
separated. The remaining components are only used to support the bearings.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">One
can see from the functional diagram the complexity of the bearing support
structure. Six parts are used to support two bearings on each side of the board.
Keeping the ideal system, (3.1), in mind, which would use no parts to align the
board, the functional diagram is examined. By examining the functional diagram
we can see that all of the support component's functions can be replaced by one
component. Using one roller and only one part to support that roller would be
much closer to the ideal system in comparison to the current design. The total
number of parts would be reduced from 16 to only 4. The only loss making this
change is in flexibility. The current assembly could adjust around the board to
compensate for changes in the design of the rest of the AutoLoader. However this
flexibility will not be required or necessary in a manufacturing setting.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Components
used in the previous assembly were expensive because they were specialized and
custom made. Irregular sizes and number of holes and slots increased the time to
make them. Total cost of the assembly was approximately $310 if the bearings
cost $10 each, slides and connectors cost $30 each, and the support blocks
totaled $30. Plastic Rollers could replace the bearings, which would only cost
approximately $10. Half-inch diameter steel rod can be used to support the
rollers. The roller can be held in place on the rod by using two clevis pins,
which only cost a few dollars. One end of the rod would be threaded so that it
can be mounted on the Intech by using a nut on each side of the Intech frame.
The plastic rollers, rods, clevis pins, and small amount of machining to the rod
would result in a total assembly cost of approximately $70, resulting in a $240
savings.</font></p>

Removal of twelve components enforces the TRIZ tool: Patterns of Design
Evolution. The fifth pattern states that technological systems evolve from
complexity and then back to simplification [6]. The fourth pattern states that
systems will also evolve toward increased dynamism and controllability. In an
effort to increase the control over tall boards, the placement of the rollers on
the mount could adjustable. Depending on the length of the sock being boarded
one could move the rollers higher on the board for greater control and less
movement of the assembly. A functional diagram and solid model of the new board
stabilizer assembly can be seen in Figures 3-15 and 3-16 respectively.</font></p>

</span>Contradiction Theory Application</span></i></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; text-indent: 0; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Contradiction
theory is generally used when the designer wishes to increase one parameter of a
design without negatively effecting another parameter. The most common example
of this may be increasing strength without the technical tradeoff of increasing
weight. The main benefit of contradiction theory to this design has been idea
generation. Reviewing the forty principles is a more systematic approach to idea
generation than a conventional brainstorming session. The difference in using
contradiction theory is that general solutions are given for general problems.
General solutions must be transformed into applicable designs. Two applications
of contradiction theory are given below.</font></p>

exit the sandwiching conveyor belts when the sock reaches the top of the
machine. Socks then follow the bottom belt until it reaches the opening area.
Problems occur when the sock follows the top conveyor instead of the bottom.
Friction of the sock with the top conveyor belt causes fibers to get caught
which pulls the sock with the belt. Originally a metal plate was used to
separate the sock from the top belt. This function was insufficient, because it
often jammed the sock. The metal plate also caused sock abrasion, which is a
harmful effect. A solid model and functional diagram of the process where the
sock exits the conveyor belt can be seen below in Figures 3-17 and 3-18. The
insufficient separation action and harmful abrasion action are shown to be a
dotted line and red line, respectively in the functional diagram.</font></p>

The specific problem of the sock getting caught on the top conveyor belt must be
worded into a general problem. The two parameters chosen that best fit the
problem were 'reliability' and 'complexity of device'. It was desired to
increase the reliability of the device without the engineering tradeoff of
increasing its complexity. There were three principles suggested in the
contradiction matrix to solve this problem but none of them appeared to apply in
this case. The principle 'use a hydraulic or pneumatic construction' appeared to
have a possible application. Instead of using a solid piece of metal to separate
the sock and the conveyor belt, an air nozzle with a thin air profile could be
used. The nozzle would create an “air knife” that would flow along the
surface of the top belt and thus would peel the sock away. The air knife could
not have the harmful effect of jamming the sock because there is nothing
physical to create a pinch point. A solid model of the air nozzle separating the
sock from the belt can be in Figure 3-19.</font></p>

The resulting functional diagram using the &quot;air-knife&quot; may be seen in
Figure 3-20. The insufficient action and harmful action have been removed. The
cost of the air nozzle and its mount is slightly higher than using the metal
plate alone. Therefore the Ideality of the machine will improve but only to a
small extent because of the off setting effect of the additional cost of the air
nozzle.</font></p>

Theory Application 2</font></u></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">The
second application of contradiction theory has not yet been implemented but is
an excellent example. When socks are loaded they must be widened to the largest
width of the board, which is around the heel. Certain socks are damaged when
they are stretched to this point. The specific problem is how to prevent the
sock damage while maintaining the ability to pull the sock over the heel of the
board. The general contradiction using TRIZ parameters is how to change the
'shape' of the sock without causing any 'harmful side effects'. The following
paragraph gives a brief description of the loading process.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Socks
are loaded onto the boards using metal 'fingers' that slip into the open end of
the sock. There are four fingers altogether two of which are inside the sock
while the other two grip the sock from the outside. These metal 'fingers' work
similarly to a human finger and thumb. Each inside/outside finger pair of is
attached to a pneumatic clamp. Once the sock has been placed over the fingers by
the 'opening' subassembly the sock is widened by a horizontal pneumatic slide
that one of the clamps is mounted to. The sock is then pulled over the board.
This process can be read in more detail in section 4.2 Mechanical Design. A
solid model of the sock being held by the fingers and widened by the pneumatic
slide can be seen below in Figures 3-21. The functional diagram, Figure 3-22,
shows the harmful effect of stretching the sock caused by the horizontal
pneumatic.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">The
loading 'fingers' were determined as a possible area to reduce the sock damage
occurring due to widening the sock. The TRIZ principle 'dynamicity' was selected
to resolve the general problem of how to change the 'shape' of the sock without
causing any 'harmful side effects'. The definition of dynamicity is “make
characteristics of an object or outside environment automatically adjust for
optimal performance at each stage of operation.” [6]. This principle must now
be applied to the problem using specific terms.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">Socks
only need to be at the widest point for a moment, when they move over the heel
area. The rest of the time they can be stretched much less. Just as when one is
putting a sock on their foot. If the sock were heel width for only a moment,
when required, minimal damage would occur. The definition of dynamicity may be
interpreted as: &quot;make immovable objects, movable&quot;. The loading
'fingers' currently utilized are made of aluminum. If the 'fingers' were made of
a different substance that was flexible, they would flex in when the board is
more narrow and flex out when the board is wider such as around the heel. A
solid model of the flexing clamps can be seen below in Figure 3-23.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">The
principle of 'segmentation' was also used to generate solutions. The definition
of segmentation is “divide an object into independent parts or make an object
sectional”. These definitions spawned the idea of separating the clamps into
two sections. One section was stationary and the other section was connected to
the stationary part. The second part could move according to the sock width.
This idea has the same purpose as the first, allow the sock to be wide only when
necessary. The first solution would be closer to the ideal because it requires
fewer parts.</font></p>
