<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Abstract</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This article will give a brief overview of the intervention
of Altshuller’s Contradiction Matrix in the externalization model of knowledge
creation in the Japanese companies. The model is illustrated in the well<font size="1">-</font>known
book (see comments in the Harvard Business Review on Knowledge Management) of
Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi called « The Knowledge<font size="1">-</font>Creating
Company. How Japanese Companies Create the Dynamics of Innovation ».</p>

<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Introduction</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The extenalization model shows how an analogy or a metaphore
can be used effectively in the innovation process. The authors have used the new
product development phase in a car company to illustrate the conversion of tacit
knowledge to explicit knowledge.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">First, we describe the case study then we introduce the
intervention of the Altshuller’s Contradiction Matrix<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>
in this brainstorming.</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</u><b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Case study : The Honda City</b><a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">« In 1978, top management at Honda inaugurated the
development of a new<font size="1">-</font>concept car with the slogan, “Let’s
gamble”. The phrase expressed senior executive’s conviction that Honda’s
Civic and Accord models were becoming too familiar. Managers also realized that
along with a new post<font size="1">-</font>war generation entering the car
market, a new generation of young product designers was coming of age with
unconventional ideas about what made a good car.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The business decision that followed from the “Let’s
gamble” slogan was to form a new-product development team of young engineers
and designers. Top management charged the team with two<font size="1">-</font>and
only two<font size="1">-</font> instructions : first, to come up with a product
concept fundamentally different from anything the company had ever done before ;
and second, to make a car that was inexpensive but not cheap.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This mission might sound vague, but in fact it provided the
team with an extremely clear sense of direction. For instance, in the early days
of the project, some team members proposed designing a smaller and cheaper
version of the Honda Civic<font size="1">-</font> a safe and technologically
feasible option. But the team quickly decided this approach contradicted the
entire rationale of its mission. The only alternative was to invent something
totaly new.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Project team leader Hiroo Watanabe coined another slogan to
express his sense of team’s ambitious challenge : “Automobile Evolution”.
The phrase described an ideal. In effect, it posed the question : If the
automobile were an organism, how should it evolve ? As team members argued and
discussed what Watanabe’s slogan might mean, they came up with an answer in
the form of yet another slogan : “man-maximum, machine-minimum”. This
captured the team’s belief that the ideal car should somehow transcend the
traditional human-machine relationship. But that required challenging what
Watanabe called “the reasoning of Detroit”, which had sacrificed comfort for
appearance.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The “evolutionary” trend the team articulated eventually
came to be embodied in the image of a sphere-a car simultaneously “short”
(in length) and “tall” (in height). Such a car, they reasoned, would be
lighter and cheaper, but also more comfortable and more solid than traditional
cars. A sphere provided the most room for the passanger while taking up the
least amount of space on the road. What’s more, the shape minimized the space
taken up by the engine and other mechanical systems. This gave birth to a
product concept the team called “Tall Boy”, which eventually led to the
Honda City, the company’s distintive urban car. »</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Seeking out contradictions</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In the case study, we build a contradiction for each concept
developed by the team. In order to apply the TRIZ tool we describe each of them
separately.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">First contradiction</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The concept of “man-maximum, machine<font size="1">-</font>minimum”
is a technical contradiction. What we are trying to improve is the “area of
moving object”, and the thing that gets worse as we try to improve the area is
the “volume of moving object”.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For such technical contradiction : “area of moving object”
&amp; “volume of moving object”, the Altshuller’s Contradiction Matrix
recommends four principles :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">7 ‘Nested doll’.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">14 Spheriodality.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">17 Transition to another dimension.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">4 Asymmetry.</p>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Second contradiction</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The concept of “short (in length) and tall (in height)”
is not a contradiction. But, the reasoning of Detroit is in contradiction with
this new car style concept. So, the shape is in contradiction with the lenght.
The thing we are trying to improve is the “length of binding object”, and
the thing that gets worse as we try to improve the length of the car is the “shape”
of this one.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For such technical contradiction : “lenght of binding
object” &amp; “shape”, the Altshuller’s Contradiction Matrix recommends
four principles :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">13 Inversion.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">14 Spheriodality.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">15 Dynamicism.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">7 ‘Nested doll’.</p>
  <u>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</u><b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Third contradiction</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The concept of “tall boy” is another technical
contradiction, the thing we are trying to improve is the “length of binding
object”, and the thing that gets worse as we try to improve the legth of the
car is the “volume of binding object”.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For such technical contradiction : “leght of binding object”
&amp; “volume of binding object”, the Altshuller’s Contradiction Matrix
recommends 4 principles :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">35 Parameter changes.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">8 Anti<font size="1">-</font>weight.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">2 Extraction.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">14 Spheriodality.</p>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Conclusion</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In this engineering problem, the analogy found by the Honda
City development team was an image of a sphere that contains the maximum volume
within the minimun surface area. Probably, this brainstoming camp (tama dashi
kai) must have taken hours or even weeks.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, the Altshuller’s Contradiction Matrix
uses not only the principle of Spheriodality, but also shows others innovation
concepts.</p>
