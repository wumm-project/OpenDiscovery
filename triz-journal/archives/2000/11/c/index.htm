<p>Introduction</p>
</b>
<p>This article discusses emerging correlations between evolutionary S-curves
and the 40 Inventive Principles contained within TRIZ. The position of a system
- be it technical or non-technical - on its current S-curve plays a significant
role in determining which TRIZ tools may be deployed to improve the system. We
may see, for example, that our approaches when the system are markedly different
at the two extreme ends of the curve - Figure 1.</p>

</font></b>
<p>Given the two ends of the S-curve, it is commonly observed that the
Substance-Field Analysis method is more effective at the bottom of the curve,
and that the Contradictions toolkit is most effective at the top of the curve.
That being said, it is also clear that contradictions exist throughout the life
of the S-curve - indeed, as long as the system exists, it will contain
contradictions.</p>
<p>The Contradiction Matrix is of course a commonly applied means of managing
the choice of when to use which of the 40 Inventive Principles. Unfortunately,
for a good number of engineering problems - particularly electrical-based
systems - and for just about all non-technical problems, the Matrix is not a
reliable tool. A common response in these situations where the Matrix does not
help, is to ask problem solvers to examine each of the 40 Principles. The main
problem with this advice is that it tends to dilute the consideration of each
Principle to unacceptably low levels.</p>
<p>While research continues to examine updates to the Matrix, there are a number
of simple strategies which enable problem solvers to reduce the number of
Principles which are likely to be relevant to a given situation. This article
discusses one such method.</p>

<p>S-Curves and Trimming Trend</b></p>
<p>A previous article has discussed the correlation between an S-curve and the
Trimming evolution trend (Reference 1). Figure 2 reproduces the main correlation
suggested in that article.</p>

</font><b><font size="2">Figure 2: Approximate Relationship Between S-Curve and
System Part Count</p>
</font></b>
<p>The main message from the graph is that during the initial stages of the
S-curve, part count (NB phrase is intended to apply to both technical and
non-technical systems again) may have to rise; and during the latter stages, the
part count will become reduced.</p>
<p>With this increasing-then-decreasing part count idea in mind, examination of
the Inventive Principles suggests that certain of the 40 involve inventive
directions which also correlate to either increasing or decreasing part count:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Principles Associated With <font color="#ff0000">Increasing</font> Part Count<br>
</b>(In numerical order)</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Principle 1 - Segmentation - usually implies increased number of
    components (although, for non-technical systems may well mean a
    re-distribution or re-organisation of existing resources rather than
    necessarily addition of new resources)</li>
  <li>Principle 7 - Nested Doll</li>
  <li>Principle 8 - Counterweight - implies addition of something to counter the
    downward tendency of the problem aspect.</li>
  <li>Principle 9 - Preliminary Anti-Action - as 10 below</li>
  <li>Principle 10 - Preliminary Action - implies supply of additional things to
    perform the preliminary action</li>
  <li>Principle 11 - Beforehand Cushioning - addition of something to counter
    non-desirable affect in current system.</li>
  <li>Principle 15 - Dynamics - transition from immobile to mobile system
    implies addition of components to permit relative movement of different
    sub-components</li>
  <li>Principle 23 - Feedback - addition of components required to first sense
    and then relay feedback messages</li>
  <li>Principle 24 - Intermediary</li>
  <li>Principle 27 - Cheap Short-Living Objects (‘replace an expensive object
    with a multiple of inexpensive objects, compromising certain qualities’)</li>
  <li>Principle 38 - Strong Oxidants (‘Enriched Atmosphere’) - addition of
    active elements plus possible need for additional elements to contain or
    control the active element.</li>
  <li>Principle 39 - Inert Atmosphere - similar to Principle 38; addition of
    inert elements may also prompt addition of other elements to contain or
    control the inert elements.</li>
</ul>
<b>
<p>Principles Associated With <font color="#ff0000">Decreasing </font>Part Count<br>
</b>(In numerical order)</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Principle 2 - Taking Out</li>
  <li>Principle 3 - Local Quality - implies making existing components be
    modified to achieve the functions of several - particularly evident as a
    part-count reducer in casting operations especially since casting technology
    has evolved to permit casting of highly complex shapes.</li>
  <li>Principle 5 - Merging</li>
  <li>Principle 6 - Universality (‘make an object or structure perform
    multiple functions’)</li>
  <li>Principle 20 - Continuity of Useful Action (‘B: eliminate all idle or
    intermittent actions or work’)</li>
  <li>Principle 25 - Self-Service</li>
  <li>Principle 40 - Composite Materials - combining multiple
    structures/functions into a coherent composite structure.</li>
</ul>

Applicability</p>
</font></b></font><b>
<p></b>Bringing the ‘increasing’ and ‘decreasing’ Principles together
onto one picture gives the reference image shown in Figure 3. It is hoped that
this picture will be of some value to problem owners working in areas -
particularly non-technical - where the Contradiction Matrix is not effective.</p>
<p>Note that some of the Principles cannot be categorised into either ‘increasing’
or ‘decreasing’ part count usage because they are either part-count neutral
(‘Colour Changes’) or may cause part count to change in either direction
depending on the particular circumstances of the system.</p>
<b>
<p>Health Warning</p>
<p></b>Care should be applied when employing the recommendations contained in
this article in cases where systems and sub-systems are shifting to new
S-curves. More will be written about the importance of S-curves and S-curve
families in a future article.</p>
