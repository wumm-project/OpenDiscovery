<p align="JUSTIFY">This paper describes how to use the framework of Axiomatic
Design to identify a proper system output response and bridge the gap between
the conceptual design and the parameter design to facilitate the upfront
robustness thinking, which is an extension to the methodology, presented in Part
I. Part II builds upon the rationale presented in Part I for the proper
identification of system output response in a more complex technical system. It
could be, for instance, be a design review process to investigate how a design
concept may be optimized to desensitize the side effects of noise factors. It is
shown that using bottom-up approach based on axiomatic design bridges the gap
between conceptual design and parameter design. By applying the method in Part
II, engineer gains deeper insight of design concept structure and the physical
effects of the corresponding design parameters.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">1. Introduction</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Engineering design optimization has been developed greatly
[2], [3] and [4] during the last two decades and find more and more applications
due to the development of computational capabilities. However, design
optimization may not always accomplish the desired results. First, generic
optimization problem allows only one objective function (a single functional
requirement) with multiple design variables (deign parameters) [5], the
selection of the correct objective function is very important. Multiple
objective optimization is essentially a trade of among several objectives, which
may not be the best approach according to TRIZ. Secondly, these optimization
methodologies do not necessary include the consideration of noise strategies to
desensitize the side effects of uncontrollable factors to system performance in
the user conditions. Motivated by the needs of improving the effectiveness and
efficiency of design optimization, Taguchi points out that the system output
response (objective function) for design optimization should not be given but
chosen [6] and suggests guidelines for the proper selection of quality
characteristics that are consistent with his philosophy [7]. The efficiency of
research will drop if it is not possible to find characteristics (system output
responses) that reflect the effects of the individual factors regardless of the
influence of other factors [8].</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The design process can be divided into the conceptual design
and the detailed design. As discussed in part I, the axiomatic design approach
can be applied well in the conceptual design. Robust Design using Taguchi's
methodology is another systematic and efficient way to meet the requirements of
designing high quality product and process especially in the detailed design [1]
and [9]. Parameter design is the heart of robust design methodologies and in
terms of axiomatic design, it is relates to functional, physical and process and
domain and both the design axioms. Although it seems there are close
similarities between the Axiomatic Design and the Robust Design methodologies,
thus far no literature has discussed the relationship between functional
requirements in axiomatic approach and the system output response in robust
design methodologies. In this paper, an attempt is made to investigate and
develop the relationship between the functional requirements in the axiomatic
approach and the system output response in the robust design. Along with the
investigation and the development of the relationship, a method known as design
response structural analysis using axiomatic design is proposed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Robust conceptual design using axiomatic design approach will
certainly help to achieve robust parameter design. However, even with a proper
conceptual design based on the axiomatic design axioms, a design may not be
optimized without going through a proper robust parameter design study. Robust
Design using Taguchi method is an engineering optimization strategy [10] and
concentrates on:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Identifying the &quot;ideal function (s)&quot; for a
    specific technology or product/process design, then</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Selectively choosing the best levels of design parameters
    that optimize performance reliably.</li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is the goal of robust design to search for and obtain the
state of robustness in product/process designs.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Obviously, identification of basic function and ideal
function are the main tasks for successful efforts of robust design. In order to
identify and select a proper system output response for the purpose of system
optimization, both system thinking and understanding of the effects of physical
components (in terms of material, information and energy) are necessary. From
the design development standpoint, this means we need to use both top-down
approach through functional breakdown and bottom-up approach to analyze how the
components, subsystem and system can satisfy their basic functions.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A system is a set of connected activities or functions that
are designed to work together to perform a specific function and produce an
intended outcome. Systems exist to perform some needed function, using input and
transforming it into an output.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Engineered systems are man-made systems, which use material,
information or energy transformations to convert input material, information and
energy into specific, intended output by utilizing laws of physics. These
engineered systems are designed to deliver specific results requested by
customers.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Basic function is a function that provides the smooth
(effective and efficient) transformation of system input such as information,
material or energy to the desired system output. Such basic function robustness
has to be optimized to achieve the long-term quality/reliability and the
ultimate goal of customer satisfaction. In every engineered system, there exists
some form of perfect or ideal relationship between the system input and the
system output.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Robust design seeks to attain the ideal state, referred to as
the design's ideal function. Ideal function is preferred relationship existing
between the system input to the system and resulting output response is
observed. Using the energy transformation as an example, achieving efficiency in
the transformation system of energy means obtaining an ideal relationship
between input energy and output energy (response). If there would be no energy
loss, input energy would be equal to the useful output energy. In reality,
nothing functions likes this. Every system is less than 100% efficient in its
energy transformation. This means that the energy loss goes to create unintended
function.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In summary, in order to evaluate and optimize the system
functional behavior, it is essential to identify the system's basic function and
the ideal relationship between the system input and the system output.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Identifying a system basic function and the ideal function
through the axiomatic design as top-down approach, and bottom-up approach
through design parameter, component, subsystem analysis and substance field
analysis can provide a scientific way to serve our purposes of searching a
proper system output response.</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">2.1 System Output Response Identification using Axiomatic
    Design</p>
    </b>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">To identify proper system output response(s) based on the
    customer's perceived result for the purposes of optimization, it is
    necessary to:</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Perform a functional breakdown that enables the
        functions of the system and their hierarchy to be defined (system
        functions, subfunctions, basic functions), and a physical breakdown
        which characterizes the system structure and identifies all its
        subsystems, including the elementary components; this breakdown into a
        hierarchical structure is obtained by zigzagging between the functional
        domain and physical domain.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Identify a basic function and the corresponding ideal
        function to achieve the highest probability of understanding and
        evaluating the smooth transformation of material, information and energy
        in an engineered system.</li>
    </ol>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The first phase is part of routine Axiomatic Design
    theory: using a &quot;top-down&quot; zigzagging approach, the system is
    defined by increasingly detail levels: Design matrices are then used to
    verify that the choice of DPs &quot;properly&quot; (that is, satisfying the
    first axiom) satisfies the FRs at each level.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The second phase is known as Axiomatic Design for
    structural system output response identification, which represents the
    &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach, can be divided into three main tasks:</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Differentiate the basic function from other
        non-transformation functions</li>
      <li>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Chose the best ideal function (the ideal relationship
        between input and output)</li>
      <li>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Improve the probability of conducting robust
        parameter design successfully (promote and improve additivity between
        components and subsystem(s) so that the results of experiment will be
        more repeatable and conclusive).</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The design and the proper selection of a system output
response is very important for the optimization of system's functional behavior.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Searching a turning factor in robust parameter design using
Taguchi method is similar to searching a design parameter satisfying a given
function requirement based on the design axioms. Suh [Suh90] mentions that there
are situations where experimental techniques, combined with statistical
analysis, must be used to analyze the design using the design axioms:</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ol>
    <li>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">when reliable analytical relationships between FRs and
      DPs are not available, then the elements of the design matrix can only be
      determined experimentally;</li>
    <li>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">when principal DPs that control FRs must be determined
      empirically from a large set of potential DPs.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In the design optimization, we are interested in knowing how
to maximize a given system's intended output rather than how a specific FR can
be satisfied. Functional requirements may not be always necessary the system
output response(s). However, system output response could be one of the FRs.
Identifying a design output response may be straightforward when a design starts
from top-down using zigzagging mapping between functional requirements and
design parameters. However, a system output response must be selected carefully
when there are couplings of system output responses and the result of the design
process in form of a complex hardware, or a complex manufacturing process exists
for which the principal DPs have not been identified and the relationships
between FRs and DPs are not known.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">2.2 The Bottom-Up System Output Response Identification</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For the bottom-up system output response identification it is
necessary to describe the product from the intended functional behavior
perspective and how the functional behavior can be measured.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">System output response is an effective characteristic to
describe the system's functional behavior and measure as data, which should be
basic function based.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Design matrices are set up for all the FR-DP relations at the
different levels through the first step in the FR-DP zigzagging mapping. The
identification starts at the lowest level of DPs in lowest level subsystem.
Special focus is placed on how DPs are affecting the immediate function
requirements and the ultimate system output response. Typical questions that
arise during the bottom-up output response identification are as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">What is the design intent?</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">What are the functional requirements in the design
    (component, subsystem and system)?</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">How many possible system measurable output
    characteristics?</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Which system measurable output characteristic is basic
    function related?</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Can an input signal of the engineered system be
    identified?</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Can an ideal relationship between the input and output be
    defined and modeled?</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">How easy the output response can be measured</li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The purposes of the technology development and the product
design are to deliver certain intended functions. The technical system exists
for transforming the input of the system to the output of the system through
basic function.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Taking the advantage of results from top-down zigzagging
mapping between functional requirements and design parameters, system, we have
broken the design down into manageable subsystems that form functional subsets
contributing to the overall energy transformation controlling the function of
the product. In the lowest level of DPs, we select all corresponding FRs.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For instance, a hood latch example presented in (Suh 99) [14]
on page 66, the design task is to hold a pin attached to the hood in the lock
when the hood is closed and to release the pin to an open position when the hood
is to be opened. By going through necessary zigzagging mapping procedures, the
FR-DP tree of the hood latch design can be summarized and is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="d01.gif" width="618" height="543"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This is a completely uncoupled design. According to the
design axioms, this design is a good conceptual design. However, from the
standpoint of design optimization (robust design) using Taguchi method, this
design concept may need to be optimized further so that the hood latch
performance is insensitive to the side effects of noise factors such as aging.
What is the hood latch performance? In other words, what are the design intent
and the system output response? In this design, spring is the energy resource
and vital for the design functional requirements. In the mean time, the spring
is also a potential problem due to its mechanical energy release impacting to
the another components in the design, which will increase wear and unstable
performance in long-term. Even though the conceptual design in this example is
uncouple and good from the concept design structural (axiomatic design)
standpoint, it is necessary to optimize the spring so that the spring force is
insensitive to the system output response. Such optimization efforts could be
achieved through robust parameter design. If we could make the spring force
insensitive to the system output response which means we could select a spring
with less spring force at the lowest possible costs and has much less impact
side effects. The benefits of performing such efforts is same as one stone kills
two birds in terms of reducing the sensitivity of spring force to system
performance and desensitizing the side effects of noise factors. It is clear
that the effort of identifying and selecting a proper system output response is
important and vital for the successful design optimization.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">From the Figure 1, we start with the lowest level of DPs like
DP221 and DP222 and the corresponding FRs. With each level of component and
subsystem, we review the design intent and the basic function. During this
process, one key idea has to be kept in mind all the time is that we would like
to optimize a system's functionality rather than a part or a system itself. The
next question becomes how a corresponding FRs can be a system output response.
If the existing functional requirements are not the best choice, what else could
be considered? This has to be linked to the identification of system output
response using substance-field analysis presented in the Part I. The Design
Response Structural Analysis in Part I is used the best when a boundary of a
system/subsystem is known. By reviewing each level of FR-DP tree in Figure 1,
the summary of the possible system output responses for each level is shown in
Table 1.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">From the Table 1, we can see there are three levels of
zigzagging mappings. At each level, there are identified possible system output
responses and the input signals.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The possible subsystem output responses and the input signal
are:</p>

<p align="center">Table 1. Summary of system input and output analysis</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There are more than one possible system output responses in
this example. Which one could be the right choice? With a couple of possible
system output responses, let's review the basic function of this hood latch
design. The design intent is to hold a pin attached to the hood in the lock when
the hood is closed and to release the pin to an open position when the hood is
to be opened. However, the basic function of this concept design is how the
energy of spring force can be transformed smoothly to do the job in terms of
closing and opening the pin consistently over the time. It is clearer now that
the system output response should be the pin disengagement force and the input
signal is the spring force. Having identified the proper system output response
and the input signal, the effectiveness of design optimization can be improved
significantly. The engineered diagram and the ideal function are shown in the
Figure 2 and the Figure 3 respectively.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="d02.gif" width="439" height="396"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">During the process of identifying the system output response,
there is a lot of the information and decision-making go between the system,
subsystems, components, FRs and DPs. This is one of the reasons how the process
of identifying system output response can help to enhance the improvements of a
concept design in the upfront design phase.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Usually, a given design may not be necessary uncoupled and
not even decoupled. It should be pointed out that this example used here is
somewhat ideal. The task of identifying a proper system output response becomes
more challenging if a conceptual design is not uncoupled. By going through the
procedures in the methodology of identification of system output response, we
can be able to get clearer pictures about how a design can perform its basic
function and plan for design optimization. More important benefit is to take the
advantage of valuable feedback from the analyses of possible system output
responses to improve a concept design. For example, using the same hood latch
design, the original hood latch design was concerned with noise problem was a
decoupled design. Such noise problem could have been improved if the methodology
of identification of system output response was used without waiting the last
minute result of testing (see Table 2, the level 1 and level 2 mapping in table
2 is same as in the Table 1). This is because the methodology of identification
of system output response requires the understanding of design basic function
and is concerned about how the energy can be transformed smoothly in an
engineered system. Of course, this is not an easy task and has to be with
certain experience and expertise in the interested areas.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">From Table 2, based on the analyses of system output
response, we can know quickly that the impact noise could come from design
parameter DP222 without having the test results.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">By focusing on identifying possible system output responses
and differentiating basic function from other non-basic function output
responses, a great deal of information about the functional requirements and
design parameters can provide a clue for engineers to improve a concept design
as necessary. The benefits regarding design for testability would benefit from
the methodology of identification of system output response, which is beyond the
scope of this paper.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Our objective is to bridge the gap between conceptual design
and parameter design by identifying proper system output response(s) to serve
three main purposes:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">To provide just-in-time feedback to improve concept
    design</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">To plan for robust parameter design</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">To improve the effectiveness of robust parameter design</li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In doing so, we can be able to facilitate the upfront
robustness thinking and implement the strategy of robust conceptual design and
robust parameter design.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">3. DPs Coupling effects Assessments for this research</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The additivity property of the effects of design parameter
with respect to a system output response is important for the robust parameter
design. In order to assess the additive effects of design parameters, we must
assess the coupling effects of design parameters. It is necessary to separate
the negative correlation from the positive correlation. This is because that we
would like to know how the similar physical effects could be combined so that
the energy can be transformed smoothly. For the purposes of this paper, we can
consider the negative coupling effects as an integer value between zero, two,
three four and five. Zero indicates no coupling effects at all, three indicates
moderate coupling effects and five indicates substantial effects. For the
positive correlations, we just would like to use the symbol <img border="0" src="d03a.gif" width="17" height="17">
indicates the strong relation, <img border="0" src="d03b.gif" width="14" height="14"> indicates the
medium correlation and <img border="0" src="d03c.gif" width="15" height="15"> indicates the weak
correlation between the DPs. These positive relationships are important for the
selection of system output response.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The principle of coupling effects is proposed as means to
accurately assess the magnitude of the potential interaction between two design
parameters<font color="#000000">. A coupling effect occurs if the effect of a
factor on the selected system output response changes under different levels of
another factor (i.e. the effect of the first factor is not consistent under all
conditions of the second factor</font>. For example: In a baking process, if
percent yield is used for the system output response, then the coupling effect
is significant (Figure 4).</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="index.2.gif" width="354" height="178"><br>
Figure 4. Example of Coupling Effects</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is essential to recognize that this initial interaction
effects. The magnitude assessment is intended to predict the likelihood that a
system output response will possess the additivity preferred. In addition, this
step also aids the designer in considering the natural laws and inherent
relationships that are likely to be the driving forces behind the coupling
effects of DPs and the interactions between FRs. Thus, while optimizing a given
concept, designer can be forewarned of areas of the design that will require
extra and consideration when attempting to synthesize a solution that minimizes
the coupling effect of DPs and the corresponding interactions between FRs. While
it is true that this step can involve significant time and from the designer, it
is believed that this early effort will facilitate more efficient robust
parameter design synthesis and design analysis, reduce the need for
re-optimization, and provide feedback for concept improvement that satisfy the
independence axiom as well as the FRs.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It should be noted that the structure of this interaction
assessment methodology is robust against understand estimating coupling effects.
This is necessary to avoid missing critical potential relationships even though
the designer may not possess a full understanding of what those relationships
are or the extent of their effect. Accuracy of the procedure is based on a
designer's experience, intuition, ability to visualize relationships and
understanding of natural laws. Testing of the methodology will determine the
level of difficulty encountered by the test subjects during the performance of
the coupling effect assessments.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">3.1 Construct the Matrix of DPs Coupling Effects</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The interaction assessment procedure described in the
previous section must be performed for each pair of DPs to completely represent
the structure of the design problem. Completion of all pairwise interaction or
correlation assessments yields a matrix of interaction magnitudes shown in
Figure 5.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="d04.gif" width="521" height="216"><br>
Figure 5: DPs Coupling Effects</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It can be easily seen that the number of DP interactions (Q)
that must be assessed is given by the equation:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="d05.gif" width="274" height="54"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Where N is the number of DPs in the design problem.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A quantitative assessment of overall independence (I)can be
made from the following equation:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="d06.gif" width="586" height="47"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Where a value of I=1 indicates perfect independence and a
value of M=0 indicates no independence between DPs.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Negative correlation (coupling effects) assessment indicates
that the areas need more attention and the coupling effects must be reduced by
selecting a proper system output response. Possive correlation assessments
provides an opportunity to encourage engineers to investigate how the ways of
energy transformation in the technical system could be grouped harmonly with a
proper selection of system output response. Figure 4 offers a good overview on
how some DPs may be combined based on the positive correlation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In this step, we are not looking for numerical precise
correlation but just collect all necessary information regarding the effects of
DPs on a system output response based on the engineers' knowledge, experience,
expertise and available data as much as possible.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">3.2 Partitioning the Coupling Effects</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We have now represented the identification of system output
response as a matrix of coupling DPs and the positive correlations between the
DPs while searching for possible system output response with the property of
additive effects of DPs. When the DPs are strongly coupled, they should be
partitioned such that highly coupled DPs are placed together within a partition
while DPs with little coupling effects are placed in separate partitions. The
resulting partitions yield smaller, relatively independent subgroup whose
corresponding system output response can be more easily identified and
synthesized by the engineer. An important attribute of the partitioning process
is that it must focus on the identifiation of system output in terms of how the
partition can help to regroup DPs such that the effects of regrouped DPs could
be additive or monotonic on a system output response response and provide the
feedback to improve the concpetual design.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">By examining all possible system outputs, we would like to
chose one system outpput reponse which will help to elminate or at least to
reduce the coupling effects between DPs to the minimum level. We would like to
partition the problem of identifying the system output response in a way that we
can be able to reduce the complexity of the overall problem in terms of coupling
effects and additivity while simultaneously highlighting the interactive
portions of the problem that will require the most attention from the standpoint
of finding relative less coupling effects of DPs with respect to a specific
system output response being selected.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">3.2.1 Partition Principle</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Given a system output response being selected</p>
</b>
</p><ol>
  <li>

<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><img border="0" src="d07.gif" width="521" height="154"></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY">These design parameters could be decomposed into groups by
sensitivity analysis. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) in terms of
signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio could be utilized to conduct the sensitivity
analysis.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</sub>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The partition principle can be utilized to select a principle
DP to satisfy a given FR based on the Independent Axiom. In the concpet design
using axiomatic design approach is foucsed on how to find DPs to satisfy the
given set of FRs. However, our focus is not to find DPs to satisfy the given FRs
but to search a system output response to reduce the DPs coupling effects. Keep
in mind that our intent is to identify a proper system output response for
design optimization. The differnces between the conceptual design using design
axioms and the identificaton of system output response are shown in the Table 3.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Axiom 3 (Axiom of finite physical effects) </b>[15]</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We know that we cannot design anything that is incompatible
with natural principle and laws. And we know that these well-known physical
principles are finite. The finiteness of physical effects is true for a certain
point of time, the state of art in natural science; finding new effects is
concerned to be research in natural science.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">With the partitioned design parameters, the coupling effect
magnitudes that have been identified thus far represent the likelihood of a
coupling effects based on known or assumed physical relationships between DPs in
a selected system output response. We have now represented the problem of
identifying system output response as a matrix of coupling DPs and the positive
relationship of DPs. Based on the coupling effects matrix, engineer should try
to understand the corresponding physical phenomena and effects.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">According to axiom 3, m is finite. This is important because
we do not have to worry about countless physical effects, which we may not know
at that time. By focusing on the major physical effects, we can be able to group
and combine design parameters to decouple the coupling effects of design
parameters with a given system output. Examining all possible alternative system
output responses, we could select a system output response with better additive
effects of design parameters.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For example, the catapult device shown in Figure 8 has a
number of design parameters that have a high potential for coupling effects
[13]. The objective of this device is to throw small objects and hit a certain

<p align="JUSTIFY">From the equation (4.2)-(4.4) above, DP5, stop location, is
the only design parameter controls the angle-physical effect. Physical effect
PE2 is the coupled effects of DP1 and DP5. Physical effect PE3 is the sum of all
design parameters. We can decouple the coupling effects of DP5 on PE2 and PE3
and the effects of DP1 on PE3 by minimizing the corresponding influences.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Since the only factor that controls the angle of release is
the stop location, which is a critical control factor assignment. The stop
location's influence on height and speed must be minimized to decouple the
coupling effects. The efforts of minimizing the stop location's influence are
feasible. By weakening the coupling effects and redefining some proper design
parameter, the new mapping diagram can be modified as shown in Figure 11. G
(catapult height) is a redefined new factor.</p>

basic function of the design intent and a partitioned coupling effect of DPs.
The magnitudes of coupling effects that have been identified thus far represent
the likelihood of a coupling effect based on known or assumed physical
relationships between DPs in a given conceptual design. The DPs can be mapped to
some of the finite physical effects. Within each mapped physical effects of a
given system output response, the engineer must now strive to apply independence
axiom to group and decouple the effects of DPs and apply information axiom to
select the system output response. This is done by:</p>

effects of DPs.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">6. Synthesizing a System Output Response</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The process of identifying system output response and
synthesizing the design parameters for each system output response is the
essence of optimization of technology and new product development. This subject
is a topic of research and literature, the details of which have been somewhat
simplified here. Taguchi [16] provides an excellent overview of relevant
literature in the area of identification of system output response. He points
that system output response is not given but has to be chosen. Phadke [7] cites
the work of Taguchi and Fowlkes and Creveling [13] then enhances guidelines of
identification of system output response widely addressed in the literature.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">American Supplier Institute (ASI) 1989 promoted a theme that
&quot;to get quality, don't measure quality&quot;. This way of thinking is very
important for the productivity of engineering activities. This involves
understanding the problem and focusing on the critical engineering design
intent. In the case of brake system, its function is to create torque, which
causes deceleration. We should measure the relationship between the force of the
driver's foot on the brake pedal (signal) and the torque generated (the system
output response). Design may not be necessary optimized by minimizing the
failures. However, optimized design can reduce failures automatically. This is
because the input energy of a system can be transformed smoothly to the output
energy without having &quot;unintended energy&quot; creating side effects. In
parameter design, the most important job of the engineer is to select an
effective characteristic to measure as data.We should measure data that
relate to the function itself and not the symptoms of variability.Quality
problems take place because of variability in the energy transformation.
Considering the energy transformation helps to recognize the function of the
system (Shin Taguchi) [6].</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is clear from the extent of the literature on the subject
that there are some guidelines-the only state of art, which is not universally
applicable to the steps of identification of system output response. As with
top-down zigzagging mapping between FRs and DPs, and the bottom-up basic
function search, coupling effect assessments, mapping between design parameters
and physical effects, success in identification of system output response is a
combination of an effective structured methodology and the designer's
experience, intuition, and natural ability to conceive solutions.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">System output response identification using the bottom-up
structured system response analysis requires that a basic function be identified
for system or subsystem and the physical effects be identified for each DP. When
the designer has identified a system output response for the corresponding
engineered system, the coupling effects of DP and the additivity of system
output response must be examined and synthesized in the context of the overall
engineered system. Adjustments will often be required due to non-ideal concept
design structure based on the design axiom especially the unforeseen coupling
effects of DPs and the unforeseen FR interactions or merely to ensure
compatibility as solutions to the physical effects mapping are combined into a
single holistic solution. The identified system output response should have a
maximum additivity in terms of effects of design parameters and must be able to
measure the engineered system's functional behavior rather than symptoms. The
completion of this step marks the end of the first identification of system
output response iteration.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Usually there may be couple of possible system output
responses available for consideration. With the first iteration of
identification of system output response in hand, the designer will examine the
rest of possible system output responses and reassesses the physical effects of
DP and the coupling effects and constructs an updated DP-PE mapping strategy.
This is done same as previously described.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">7. Applying the Information Axiom to the Selection of a
System Output Response</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The previously described design method may be repeated in
order to identify and select a relative better system output response. Each of
possible system output response is basic function based and has proper
additivity with respect to the effects of design parameters to a certain extent
as measured by the metric (I). The designer should then examine each possible
system output response in light of optimization information theorem above (Suh's
information axiom) in order to select the best system output response that can
be used to optimize the system's functional behavior. Recall that the
information axiom says that the best design that satisfies the independence
axiom is the one that minimizes information content. This statement can be
translated into the problem of system output response selection. That is the
best system output response that has the maximum additivity is the one that
minimizes information content. The meaning of information content in the design
optimization problem is the probability of measuring design intent rather than
symptoms such as failure rates, percent defect rates and etc. Information
content is a predictor of relative complexity.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Exactly how to assess the level of information content in the
selection of system output response is not obvious. As the number of possible
system output response increases, the information (complexity) in terms of easy
to measure, coupling effects of DPs, chain of action mode and the chain of
physical effects required capturing the system's behavior increases.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">El-Haik and Yang [17] addressed the issue of correlation in
the axiomatic design. They defined a measure of complexity that is composed of
three aspects: variability, correlation and vulnerability. Vulnerability relates
to the design's size, interdependency of DPs (i.e. correlation), and the FR's
sensitivity to changes in design parameters. This division of complexity in
three parts gives, together with Boltzman's entropy measure, a formula for
complexity. El-Haik and Yang have therefore proposed a new measure of complexity
that accounts for correlation among DPs.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In contrast to the measure and formula proposed by El-Haik
and Yang [17], Frey, Jahangir and Engelhardt [18] presented a means to compute
information content as defined by [Suh90] while accounting for correlation and
proved mathematically that the information content of a decoupled design is
never exactly the sum of the information of the functional requirements.
Decoupled designs always induce some correlation among the functional
requirements even when the design parameters (DPs) are independent.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is clear from the extent of the literature on the
assessment of information content that there is no single measure that is
universally applicable to the assessment of information content.</p>
<sub></sub>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus if it is not feasible to assess the identified system
output response on the basis of a quantitative measure of information content,
we should instead seek a more qualitative approach. Suh (1990) defines
information content as, &quot; a measure of the probability of success of
achieving the specified FRs (in the case of product design)&quot;. Existing
structured methods of identification of system output response allow the
designer to do essentially the same thing. These methods assess the relative
likelihood that a particular selected system output response will capture the
system's behavior as compared to other competing system output responses. The
system output response are then rated and ranked based on a measure similar to
the information axiom.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">One of the most widely used methods of design concept
selection is that proposed by Pugh (1981). Pugh's method rates a set of proposed
design concepts with respect to a selected datum concept. This idea can be
adapted in the selection of system output response. The ratings are based on the
relative ability of a system output response to satisfy a predetermined set of
criteria such as additivity, easy to measure, constraints and overall
independence and chain of effects. A rating can be either better than the datum
(+), the same as the datum (S), or worse than the datum (-). A system output
response comparison and evaluation matrix is generated that allows the
identification of the best system output response(s). Pugh proposes that the
overall selection effort be done by a relevant group and involve several
iterations in which the datum system output response is changed. Again, this can
be adapted in the system output response selection process. The goal is to see
if a strong pattern of system output response emerges. From this one or more
system output responses will usually tend to dominate.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In the context of system output response identification, the
issues of information content as criteria for system output response selection
must be considered at all subsequent stage of the design optimization (robust
parameter design) through product life cycle. This includes detailed design,
manufacturing, and etc. Assessing the information content at any of these phases
requires input form the people who will be directly involved with the product at
that phase.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">8. Comparisons with other methods for the system output
response</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A competing method for the selection of system output
response is the guidelines offered by Taguchi [Phadke89]. Taguchi suggests that
the top priority of robust product design activities should always be on the
improvement of product function. To accomplish this, energy-related system
output response should be selected whenever possible. Five guidelines are
suggested to serve the purpose to identify a proper system output response.
Acknowledgment of the importance of the criteria in the guidelines is the key to
understand the use of Taguchi methods. In general, it will be often be quite
difficult to identify system output responses, which meet all of these criteria.
Taguchi himself acknowledges this fact and states that the use of Taguchi
methods will be inefficient to the extent that these guidelines are not
satisfied.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In contrast to the guidelines suggested by Taguchi, the
methodology of design response structural analysis presented in this paper
offers more detail directions and activities to meet the criteria in the
guidelines. The summary of major differences between the structural system
output response identification and the guidelines for selection of system output
response is shown in Table 4.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">9. Conclusions</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This paper has provided a scientific way of identifying
system output response for the effective robust parameter design. The conceptual
design robustness and the effectivenss of parameter design can be improved
through the proper identificaiton of system output response in the upfront
design stage. Therefore, the gap between the conceptual design and the parameter
design can be minimized.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We have presented four rules in Part I based on the substnace-field
analysis (TRIZ) for how to choose a system output response analysis. The first
rule is <i>the substance-field model development for system output response</i>
that encourages engineers to select or create an energy-related system output
response. The second rule <i>is to change the scope and boundary of technical
system</i> that helps engineers to thinks something outside the current system.
The third and the fourth rules together suggest taking a deep consideration in
the chain of action mode and the chain of effects to understand how the energy
is formed or transformed. With these four rules, engineer can have more clear
directions to identify a proper system output response.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Along with the four rules, the blending top-down and
bottom-up for the identification of system output response approach using
axiomatic design framework provides an environment for engineer to break down a
system to a manageable subsystem and select a proper system output response for
each corresponding subsystem. The identification of system output response, in
terms of bottom-up system output response identification, is strengthened by
knowledge gained from the assessment of DPs coupling effects, partitioning the
DPs coupling effects and mapping out the DPs to their corresponding physical
effects. The knowledge gained during the identification of system output
response can feedback to the concept design immediately for the concept design
improvement. The methodology of design response structural analysis has helped
to serve two purposes:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">to prepare for the robust parameter;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">to improve the concept design robustness.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>

  </blockquote>
</sub>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Therefore, the methodology of design response structural
analysis can bridge the gap between the conceptual design and parameter design.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Compared with other approaches to identify the system output
response, the approach presented in this paper offers more detail and specific
steps with the proven theorem as the theoretical foundation. In other word, this
approach is more scientific way rather than the state of art.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The presented approach was successfully applied to some very
challenging case studies.</p>
