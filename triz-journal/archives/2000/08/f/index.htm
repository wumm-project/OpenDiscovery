<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Abstract:</FONT></B>
<P>History and current activities of introducing TRIZ in Japan are
summarized.&nbsp; TRIZ has been introduced into Japan for these three years and
gradually getting popularity among pioneering engineers in industries.&nbsp; But
Japanese TRIZ learners/practitioners still have much difficulty in mastering the
way of thinking and in applying TRIZ to their actual problems.&nbsp; For
overcoming this difficulty, several textbooks have been published in Japanese
and a public WWW site "TRIZ Home Page in Japan" is serving.&nbsp; Needs of
easier process for creative problem solving has been recognized, and USIT
(Unified Structured Inventive Thinking) developed at Ford has been introduced as
a simplified TRIZ methodology.&nbsp; Case studies and training practices of USIT
are presented.&nbsp; The "Slow-but-Steady" strategy of introducing TRIZ into
Japanese industries is recommended. <BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT size=+1>1.&nbsp; Introduction</FONT></B>
<P>Since the recent introduction of TRIZ in Japan in 1996 - 1997, a handful of
textbooks are already published in Japanese, TRIZ software tools of full
Japanese version have been sold, and many introductory training seminars on TRIZ
software tools have been given.&nbsp; Engineers and industries have gradually
recognized TRIZ and started their trials of introducing it as a new methodology
for innovative R&amp;D.
<P>But learners and practitioners in Japanese industries still feel much
difficulty in applying TRIZ to their actual problems.&nbsp; Understanding of its
methodology, i.e. the way of thinking, is more important and more difficult than
learning usage of its software tools.
<P>Under the current situation that real case studies in contemporary
technologies have rarely been published because of companies' secrecy policies,
beginners of TRIZ do not have enough chances of learning how to apply
TRIZ.&nbsp; Thus even pioneering practitioners of TRIZ in industries do not have
successful experiences of applying TRIZ yet in Japan.
<P>For improving this situation, the "TRIZ Home Page in Japan"<FONT
color=#3333ff> [1] </FONT>has been established and operated by the present
author as an open forum for information exchange on TRIZ on a non-profit
basis.&nbsp; This WWW site has the unique position of being voluntarily operated
in academia independently of any commercial company and is serving mainly for
industries .
<P>The present author understands that TRIZ has three main aspects: (a)
methodology as a new viewpoint of technology, (b) methodology as a thinking way
for problem solving, and (c) knowledge base as a collection of examples
implementing the methodology (a) (See Table 1).
<P>For introducing TRIZ in engineering and in industries, these three aspects
should be important as well.&nbsp; TRIZ software tools naturally put stress on
the knowledge base.&nbsp; Textbooks are useful for learning the methodology (a),
and further publication is desirable.&nbsp; Methods and materials for learning
the methodology (b) are the main issue of contemporary promotion of TRIZ in
Japan. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;

<P>Genrich Altshuller developed a large number of methods as thinking ways for
problem solving and composed them into various versions of ARIZ <FONT
color=#3333ff>[2]</FONT>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, however, ARIZ is complex too much
to master without intensive and long-term training under the TRIZ Founder or
other TRIZ experts.&nbsp; This difficulty is the main bottleneck for the
penetration of TRIZ, especially in Japan where personal training by TRIZ experts
has been rare mostly because of the language barriers.
<P>Easier and more practical methods are needed for realizing the Methodology
(b) aspect of TRIZ.&nbsp; In this context, USIT (Unified Structured Inventive
Thinking) <FONT color=#3333ff>[3]</FONT>, which was developed and successfully
applied at Ford Motor Company by Ed Sickafus, was recognized as a suitable
model.&nbsp; Thus, USIT has been introduced by the present author into Japanese
TRIZ community.&nbsp; USIT training seminars have been carried out with success.

<P>In the present paper, TRIZ history and activities in Japan are briefly
introduced, and approaches to application of TRIZ in Japanese industries are
presented and discussed.
<P><A name="2. History and Activities in Japan"></A>
<P><B><FONT size=+1>2.&nbsp; History and Activities of TRIZ
in Japan</FONT></B>
<P>As early as in 1972, TRIZ was first introduced into Japan.&nbsp; Altshuller's
textbook of "Algorithms of Invention" (1969 edition) was published in Japanese
translation <FONT color=#3333ff>[4]</FONT> by engineering journalists.&nbsp; It
was read by some people but did not make any substantial influence on them
because there was no personal contact and no more information available for many
years afterwards.
<P>In April 1996, Nikkei Mechanical, a Japanese monthly journal, published Glenn
Mazur's introductory paper <FONT color=#3333ff>[5]</FONT> in Japanese
translation with the catch copy of "Super-technique for invention".&nbsp; This
article triggered the recent introduction of TRIZ into Japan.&nbsp; The journal,
with Vice Editor Tsukasa Shinohara, published another article of case studies in
March 1997; and later in every issue it has published series of lectures on TRIZ
by Victor Fey and Eugene Rivin and then by Bolis Zlotin and Alla Zusman.&nbsp;
Nikkei BP published three TRIZ textbooks in Japanese translation <FONT
color=#3333ff>[6-8]</FONT>.
<P>Another group led by Professor Yotaro Hatamura, the University of Tokyo, who
have been working on creative design principles in mechanical engineering,
recognized TRIZ since several years.&nbsp; Hiroshi Igata, an engineer in Toyota
Motor Company and a former student of Hatamura, used Invention Machine's test
versions of Invention Lab around 1995 during his stay at MIT, and opened a
personal WWW site for introducing TRIZ.&nbsp; Hatamura's group published a
textbook "Introduction to TRIZ" <FONT color=#3333ff>[9]</FONT> in November
1997.&nbsp; It consists of two parts: one is the Japanese translation of Fey and
Rivin's latest textbook <FONT color=#3333ff>[10]</FONT>, while the other is
their own introduction to TRIZ including critical discussions on<FONT
color=#3333ff> [10]</FONT>.&nbsp; Hatamura's group recently published another
textbook <FONT color=#3333ff>[11]</FONT> to introduce TRIZ and their own
Creative Design Principles in a more unified way.
<P>In July 1997, Mitsubishi Research Institute<FONT color=#3333ff> [12]</FONT>,
one of major think tanks in Japan, launched the promotion of TRIZ as the general
agency of Invention Machine Corporation in Japan.&nbsp; MRI promoted the sales
of the software tool TechOptimizer by giving demonstrations and introductory
seminars to industries.&nbsp; It organized its industrial users into a
consortium and working groups.&nbsp; With the backup of the MRI's consortium,
IMC produced in January 1999 the full Japanese version of its TechOptimizer
3.0.&nbsp; MRI has been the most active TRIZ center in Japan having
more-than-hundred user companies.
<P>Sanno University <FONT color=#3333ff>[13]</FONT>, unique in its
business-oriented education and consultation activities, started its TRIZ
promotion in April 1998 as the general agency of Ideation International Inc. in
Japan.&nbsp; Sanno's TRIZ specialists have been giving open/in-company seminars
on TRIZ and consultations in industries.&nbsp; They also have the intention of
applying TRIZ to management problems besides technological ones.
<P>In this manner several tens of big manufacturing companies in Japan got their
first knowledge on TRIZ around 1997 and 1998.&nbsp; Typically in such companies,
one or a few pioneering engineers started learning TRIZ, tried to organize TRIZ
seminars by outside promoters and to install TRIZ software tools.&nbsp; In such
industries the catch copy of "Super-technique for invention" initially attracted
much attention but at the same time had to face with widely-spread
skepticism.&nbsp; Oldness of examples in TRIZ textbooks [6, 7, 9] and TRIZ
software tools available at that time enhanced the skepticism and disappointment
in the early stage of TRIZ promotion in Japan.
<P>Further difficulty for such industry pioneers was to learn how to think in
the TRIZ way and how to solve their real problems.&nbsp; Training seminars were
not given enough even for such pioneers, partly due to cutting down of education
costs under Japanese economical depression.&nbsp;&nbsp; Expensive software tools
were bought, but often were not used actively.&nbsp; The predominant TRIZ
software tools contained extensive knowledge bases and friendly user interfaces,
but only very weak guiding processes.&nbsp; Users did not know effective ways of
problem solving with the software tools.
<P>Information available on Internet has made an increasingly important role for
these years.&nbsp; It is especially true for a new and emerging area like TRIZ
because of its quick publication and easy accessibility.&nbsp; The "TRIZ
Journal"<FONT color=#3333ff> [14]</FONT> has been known among Japanese TRIZ
pioneering learners as a reliable source of information in English.
<P>In November 1998, a WWW site named the "TRIZ Home Page in Japan" <FONT
color=#3333ff>[1]</FONT> started.&nbsp; Though it is edited and operated on a
voluntary basis by the present author, it intends to be an open public forum for
information exchange on TRIZ on a non-profit basis.&nbsp; It has posted many
articles written mostly by the present author and introduced a number of
excellent papers in Japanese translation, and is now regarded as the hub site on
TRIZ in Japan.&nbsp; This site has English pages in parallel to Japanese pages
and serves as an open window from/into Japan on a global basis.
<P>Two international conferences on TRIZ were held in USA in November 1998 and
in March 1999.&nbsp; They helped Japanese TRIZ learners understand the overall
activities on TRIZ in USA and western countries.&nbsp; Activities in Russia and
Belarus was also reported by the present author <FONT color=#3333ff>[15]</FONT>
on the WWW site as a result of his personal trip there.
<P>Through these events the present author found the USIT method<FONT
color=#3333ff> [3, 16, 17]</FONT> developed at Ford should be most appropriate
for introducing as an easy-to-apply problem solving process with the essence of
TRIZ.&nbsp; Learning at the first out-of-Ford USIT Training Seminar conducted by
Ed Sickafus, the present author posted introductory articles <FONT
color=#3333ff>[18]</FONT> and case study reports <FONT color=#3333ff>[19,
20</FONT>] on his WWW site.&nbsp; He has given three-day USIT Training Seminars
in Japan three times so far<FONT color=#3333ff> [21]</FONT>.&nbsp; Thus this
method has become known among TRIZ community in Japan.
<P>Activities inside Japanese companies are not made open.&nbsp; Many big
companies have already overcome the initial skeptical period and gradually
brought up some pioneering TRIZ practitioners among their employees.&nbsp; Such
companies belong to industries of machines, automobiles, electric appliances,
high-tech information technologies, chemicals, and many others.&nbsp; Most of
the practitioners, however, are not well authorized yet for promoting TRIZ in
their company and still feel much difficulty in applying TRIZ to real problems.
<P>Outside big companies, there are also many people who are studying TRIZ
individually by textbooks and trying to apply it to their problems.&nbsp; These
people form the bases of future penetration of TRIZ in Japan, just as seen in
the history of quality control movements.
<P>No significant products/processes have been reported as successful results of
TRIZ application by Japanese companies so far.&nbsp; Real case studies with TRIZ
are much desired in Japan for people to understand how to apply TRIZ.
<P>In short, Japan is now in its infancy stage of introducing TRIZ.&nbsp; Thus
the present author is recommending to Japanese industries for a "slow-but-steady
strategy " of introducing TRIZ<FONT color=#3333ff> [22, 23]</FONT>.&nbsp;
In-company TRIZ pioneers have to find their own suitable ways to apply TRIZ to
their real problems. But in a few more years from now, Japan would reach the
emerging/growing stage of TRIZ.
<P><A name="3. Classical TRIZ"></A>
<P><B><FONT size=+1>3.&nbsp; Classical TRIZ As Is
Understood</FONT></B>
<P>TRIZ has been established and developed by Genrich Altshuller and his
students/associates for over fifty years, to form a system of wide and deep
knowledge.&nbsp; The following is a rough sketch of the so-called Classical
TRIZ, i.e. TRIZ developed before 1985, as understood by the present author <FONT
color=#3333ff>[22, 23]</FONT>.
<P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>3.1&nbsp; Methodology (a): New Viewpoint of
Technology</FONT></B>
<P>The most important contribution of TRIZ is its establishment of a new
viewpoint of technology and science characterized by its bottom-up
technology-based approach.&nbsp; Its features may be listed as follows:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) Concrete knowledge and abstract concepts together, making
  bridges between specialists' practices and scientists/engineers' academic
  work;
  <P>(2) Insights into the history of technologies, revealing trends in the
  technology evolution;
  <P>(3) Searching from the targets for the means, forming an inverse database
  of science and technology by using hierarchical classification of the target
  functions and a collection of scientific/technological knowledge;
  <P>(4) Patterns of inventive thoughts in the form of the "40 Principles of
  Invention"
  <P>(5) Formulation of problems into the "Contradiction Matrix" with the
  concepts of "Technical Contradictions" and the 39 parameters, and giving hints
  to solution in the form of frequently-used Principles of Invention;
  <P>(6) Formulation of problems with the concept of "Physical Contradictions"
  and giving "Separation Principles" for the hints to solutions;
  <P>(7) Formulation of problems with the "Substance-Field Analysis" and giving
  "76 Standards of Solution" for the hints.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR><B><FONT color=#ff0000>3.2&nbsp; Methodology (b): Thinking Way for
Problem Solving</FONT></B> <BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>(8) Using abstract model of problem &amp; solution, i.e. first
  finding an abstract model for user's actual problem and then trying to realize
  the model solution into actual solution;
  <P>(9) Imaging the goal first, especially using the concept of "Ideal Final
  Result", and coming back to the solution means so as to eliminate
  trial-and-error searching;
  <P>(10) Clarifying contradictions in the problem and trying to find a
  break-through solution without compromise;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>And many more methods, such as Smart Little People Method, System
Operator (or Multi-Screen Method), STC Operator (Size-Time-Cost Operator),
etc.&nbsp; All these methods are built into ARIZ <FONT color=#3333ff>[2]</FONT>
having a lot of iteration cycles for solving difficult inventive problems.
<P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>3.3&nbsp; Knowledge base</FONT></B>
<P>For all the systematic concepts and viewpoints listed in Section 3.1,
collections of examples have been accumulated from the analyses of world-wide
patents, scientific knowledge, and technologies.&nbsp; They have been
implemented later in the databases of TRIZ software tools.
<P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>3.4&nbsp; General Scheme</FONT></B>
<P>The general scheme established by TRIZ may be illustrated in Fig. 1 <FONT
color=#3333ff>[22]</FONT>.&nbsp; The upper part shows the world of information
in science and technology, while the bottom part the world of user's own
problem.&nbsp; It is not easy for users to utilize the science and technology
for solving their problems.&nbsp; Now that TRIZ has provided various information
extracted from science and technology, the users can find much easier ways to
reach from their problems to their solutions. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT size=+1>4.&nbsp; Towards Modernized
TRIZ</FONT></B>
<P>Since around 1985, i.e. the era of Perestroika in ex-USSR, many groups of
TRIZ experts started their own approaches to modernize TRIZ.&nbsp; The transfer
of TRIZ from the former socialist society in USSR to the present
business-competition society in the West urged the modernization of TRIZ.&nbsp;
TRIZ is now facing the problem how to penetrate into companies, i.e. into the
mass of industrial engineers.
<P>Three approaches which are influential on Japanese TRIZ community are briefly
mentioned here:
<P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>4.1 Approach by Ideation International</FONT></B><FONT
color=#3333ff>[24]</FONT>
<P>Alla Zusman mentioned in <FONT color=#3333ff>[25]</FONT> that the most
important issue for the modernization of TRIZ is to show an easy process of
utilizing Altshuller's various methods.
<P>Their solution is a new network-type diagram which represents the causal
relationships in the problem with distinction between useful and harmful
effects.&nbsp; With the input of such a diagram, the III's software tool outputs
a check list of possible view points of the problem.&nbsp; Then the users are
advised to consider all view points in turn by applying some suitable methods
selected among the original TRIZ algorithms.&nbsp; Diagrams of causal network
allow to be used for technical and non-technical problems as well, thus
expanding the application area of TRIZ.
<P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>4.2&nbsp; Approach by Invention
Machine</FONT></B><FONT color=#3333ff>[26]</FONT>
<P>IMC has developed user-friendly software tools of TRIZ knowledge bases
running on personal computers.&nbsp; Especially, the Effects database has been
continuously expanded and are useful for users to learn relevant
physical/chemical principles and technical means.
<P>Valerie Tsourikov of IMC is making much efforts to make the tool
TechOptimizer intelligent.&nbsp; The tool can automatically search and propose
sequentially-linked techniques having the given key technique at the final node
of the sequence.&nbsp; This serves engineers to devise new techniques exactly in
one of their typical ways of design thinking.&nbsp; He says that IMC has
developed a conceptual dictionary and a conceptual network representation
technique as the basis for their artificial intelligence.
<P>IMC's software tools are already developed at the level of practical
effectiveness in industrial applications and are penetrating widely into
businesses in Japan as well as in USA and others.
<P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>4.3&nbsp; Approach of USIT at Ford Motor
Co.</FONT></B>
<P>At Ford Motor Company, a different approach to TRIZ has been developed and
practiced by Ed Sickafus <FONT color=#3333ff>[16, 17]</FONT>.&nbsp; The
approach, USIT <FONT color=#3333ff>[3]</FONT>, is a much simplified version of
TRIZ for creative problem solving.
<P>In 1980s Genedy Filkovsky realized in Israel the necessity of simplifying
TRIZ for easier training/practice.&nbsp; He reduced Altshuller's 40 Principles
of Invention into only four solution techniques and formed the SIT (Systematic
Inventive Thinking) method.&nbsp; SIT was recently published by Roni Horowitz et
al. <FONT color=#3333ff>[27]</FONT> with the emphasis of solutions in the
"closed-world" and with "qualitative change" as the "sufficient conditions of
invention".
<P>Sickafus<FONT color=#3333ff> [17]</FONT> adopted SIT (after a close
comparison with TRIZ itself) and started a training program of USIT in
1995.&nbsp; He made his USIT as an easy-to-practice procedure for creative
concept generation at the most upstream of product/process development.&nbsp;
USIT does not concern engineering details, so does not use technical databases
and software tools.&nbsp; The main target of USIT is for industrial engineers to
generate multiple concepts as rapidly, freely, and creatively as possible.&nbsp;
Thus Sickafus reduced the emphasis on seeking for invention in TRIZ, for the
sake of wider practical application.
<P>Activities of USIT application at Ford <FONT color=#3333ff>[16] </FONT>were
reported in conferences.&nbsp; They seem to be the most successful case
published so far, and form an excellent model of introducing TRIZ into
industries.
<P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>4.4&nbsp; Issues of Modernizing TRIZ</FONT></B>
<P>A recent overview by James Kowalick<FONT color=#3333ff> [28]</FONT> is
helpful to understand the needs and approaches for modernization of TRIZ.&nbsp;
He discusses two aspects of TRIZ; one as a problem-solving methodology and the
other as a creativity-increasing methodology.&nbsp; Let us focus on the first
aspect in the present paper.&nbsp; Table 2 summarizes Kowalick's views of (A)
limitations and problems in traditional TRIZ, and (B) future directions.

<P><A name="5. Problem Solving with USIT"></A>
<P><B><FONT size=+1>5&nbsp; Problem Solving with
USIT</FONT></B>
<P>For presenting the present author's approaches, the problem solving process
with USIT need to be illustrated with some example.&nbsp; That is because no
handy papers have been published so far by Sickafus concerning the USIT process
itself, even though an intensive textbook <FONT color=#3333ff>[3]</FONT> was
published already.&nbsp; Articles posted by the present author in his WWW site
may be handy reference to USIT processes <FONT color=#3333ff>[18]</FONT> and
case studies <FONT color=#3333ff>[19, 20]</FONT> (See also <FONT
color=#3333ff>[29]</FONT>).
<P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>5.1&nbsp; Flowchart of the USIT process</FONT></B>
<P>USIT has a clearly-defined scheme of process as illustrated by the flowchart
shown in Fig. 3.&nbsp; (This flowchart was drawn by the present author after
slightly modifying Sickafus' chart.)&nbsp; It has three stages: problem
definition stage, problem analysis stage, and solution generation stage.

for a practical case <FONT color=#3333ff>[20]</FONT> carried out by the present
author during Sickafus' USIT Training Seminar in March 1999.&nbsp; This stage
requests the analyzer to write down the problem statement (in one or two lines),
sketch of the problem situation, root cause (one or a few plausible causes), and
a list of objects in the problem system. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;

<P>This task seems very simple at first sight.&nbsp; But such a brief problem
statement and root cause statement request the analyzer to clearly define the
problem and to sharply focus the problem solving efforts.&nbsp; Trainees at USIT
Seminars very often say that they have realized at the end this problem
definition stage most crucial for fruitful problem solving.
<P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>5.3&nbsp; Problem Analysis Stage</FONT></B>
<P>There are three analysis methods as shown in Fig. 3.&nbsp; Either or both of
(a) Closed-World method and (b) Particles method should be applied, and then (c)
Space/Time Characteristics Analysis method follows.
<P><B>5.3.1&nbsp; Closed-World method</B>
<P>This method starts with the analysis of the present system in the problem. It
seems to retain the ideas of Israeli SIT strongly, even though clearer
definitions of the concepts of Objects, Attributes, and Functions were
introduced.
<P>First the Closed-World Diagram is constructed to represent the functional
relationships among objects from the viewpoint of original designer's
intention.&nbsp; Objects are arranged vertically with the most important object
at the top and others follow in the favorable functional relation toward the
upper one.&nbsp; Sickafus has set a rather strict guideline for drawing this
diagram.&nbsp; (One weak point: this diagram lacks the presentation of the
harmful or ill functions.)
<P>Then the Qualitative Change Graphs are drawn.&nbsp; Actually, there are two
fixed graphs, showing increasing and decreasing relationships.&nbsp; The task
for the analyzer is to select a suitable effect or function as the ordinates and
then to list up relevant attributes as the abscissas.&nbsp; While performing
this task the analyzer recognizes a large number of attributes of the system's
objects and their relationship to the intended function or to the ill effect of
the problem.
<P>In Israeli SIT <FONT color=#3333ff>[27]</FONT>, the analyzer is advised to
think of inventive solutions with restriction that different types of object
should not be introduced in the Closed World and that the solution should cause
some Qualitative Change in relationship (i.e. increasing relationship turns into
decreasing/non-increasing, and vice visa) with some attribute.
<P>In USIT these two requirements in SIT are not stressed so much for the
purpose of generating multiple creative/practical solutions.&nbsp; CW Diagram
and QC Graphs may be regarded as means to clarify the functional relationships
and qualitative dependence on various attributes.&nbsp; For a case study using
the Closed World Analysis, see <FONT color=#3333ff>[19]</FONT>.
<P><B>5.3.2 Particles Method</B>
<P>Particles Method is an adoption of Altshuller's Smart Little People
Method.&nbsp; It requests the analyzers to imagine an ideal result first instead
of trying to analyze the present system.&nbsp; Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the
outputs of this method for the problem in Fig. 4.
<P>First the problem state is sketched as shown at the top-left in Fig. 5; a
close-up view at the nozzle is drawn to clarify the mechanism/problem of foam
formation. <BR>&nbsp;

    <TD><BR><FONT color=#000000>Fig. 5. Example of sketches in the Particles
      Method in USIT</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Then the ideal solution state is imagined and drawn at the top-right in Fig.
5.&nbsp; Just the ideal result should be drawn without thinking/drawing any
possible means to achieve it.&nbsp; Next, at the positions where differences
occur in the two sketches, the x marks are drawn, and they are called
"Particles".&nbsp; Particles are regarded as magical substances/Fields having
any desirable properties and being able to do any desirable actions.&nbsp; The x
marks for "Particles" are found more useful for abstract thinking than human
figure marks for "Smart Little People".
<P>In the next step, the analyzer is urged to think what kind of actions should
be asked for the Particles to perform.&nbsp; Such desired actions are broken
down into a hierarchical diagram as shown in Fig. 6 with clarifying the AND/OR
conditions between the lower nodes.&nbsp; Then for each desirable action,
possible desirable properties of the Particles should be listed up as freely as
possible. <BR>&nbsp;

    <TD><BR><FONT color=#000000>Fig. 6. Example of desired actions and
      properties in the Particles Method in USIT</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>It is advised to use plain everyday words instead of technical terms for the
actions, so as to be free from constraint of conventional technical
thinking.&nbsp; While constructing the Particles' action/property diagram, the
analyzer often think of various elements of ideas.&nbsp; Such ideas should be
memorized.
<P><B>5.3.3&nbsp; Space/Time Characteristics Analysis</B>
<P>Next, the characteristics of either the problem state or the ideal state
should be analyzed with respect to the space and to the time.&nbsp; Either the
problem's harmful effect or the system's functional performance should be taken
as the ordinates of the graphs.&nbsp; Then choosing some proper coordinates of
space and time as abscissa, the characteristics of the system are to be drawn
schematically.&nbsp; Figure 7 illustrates such graphs drawn for the present
model case. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>5.4&nbsp; Solution Generation Stage</FONT></B>
<P>USIT has four techniques for solution generation and uses them repeatedly
together with the generalization process as shown in the flowchart in Fig. 3.
<P><B>5.4.1 Four Solution Generation Techniques</B>
<P>The four techniques correspond to the operations on the objects, attributes,
and functions in the system in the following way: <BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) Attributes Dimensionality Method:&nbsp; Operations on
  attributes; activating/deactivating attributes, changing time dependence of
  attributes, qualitative change of attribute characteristics, etc.
  <P>(b) Object Pluralization Method:&nbsp; Multiplying and dividing each
  object, from zero (i.e. trimming) to infinity.
  <P>(c) Function Distribution Method:&nbsp; Distribute the functions, to
  different objects, with replacing/unifying functions, etc.
  <P>(d) Function Linkage Method:&nbsp; Link functions sequentially to devise
  new/enhanced effects.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR><B>5.4.2&nbsp; Generalization of solutions</B>
<P>In USIT it is advised to generalize each solution by using more generic
terms, so as to enhance associative thinking from wider viewpoints.&nbsp; By
using the generalization, solution ideas are enhanced in the scheme shown in
Fig. 8.&nbsp; This scheme is simple but powerful for expanding new ideas and for
viewing the search space systematically.&nbsp; (This scheme is called with
different names, such as road map<FONT color=#3333ff> [30]</FONT>, mind
mapping<FONT color=#3333ff> [28]</FONT>, etc.) <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>5.4.3&nbsp; Practices of Solution Generation</B>
<P>The four solution generation techniques may be used in any order and are
recommended to be applied to all the objects, attributes, and functions in the
system in turn.&nbsp; In the cases where the Closed-World Method was used for
the analysis stage, these four techniques are relatively easier to be applied
one by one to the system elements.&nbsp; On the other hand, in the cases where
the Particles Method was used for the analysis, solution ideas often come much
more smoothly and abundantly without applying the four techniques in such a
conscious/analytical manner.
<P>Figure 9 illustrates the solution concepts obtained for the model problem
<FONT color=#3333ff>[20]</FONT>.&nbsp; This results were obtained at Sickafus'
USIT Training Seminar essentially in one day.&nbsp; These solution concepts were
written down smoothly on the basis of the analyses shown in Figs. 6-8.

<P><B><FONT size=+1>6.&nbsp; Practices of Training USIT in
Japan</FONT></B>
<P>After attending at USIT Training Seminar<FONT color=#3333ff> [18]</FONT>
conducted by Ed Sickafus, the present author has tried to introduce USIT into
Japan by conducting similar training seminars.&nbsp; He has experiences of
giving three-day USIT Training seminars; twice in two different companies and
once at MRI to engineers coming from various companies.&nbsp; The last one is
reported here as a model case <FONT color=#3333ff>[21]</FONT>.
<P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>6.1 Organization and the Secrecy Agreement</FONT></B>
<P>Last December at the Creative Methodology WG Meeting organized by MRI, a
three-hour lecture on USIT was given to about 45 TRIZ pioneers coming from
various industries in Japan.&nbsp; Then a USIT Training Seminar was held by MRI
in January for three days, where the present author served as the
instructor.&nbsp; Twelve engineers from 10 different companies took part in it;
8 participants are TRIZ pioneers in their companies, and 4 others are relatively
new learners of TRIZ.
<P>The objective of the Seminar was to master USIT through group practices of
applying it to real problems.&nbsp; This type of training was supposed to be
much more effective<FONT color=#3333ff> [28] </FONT>than the ones with lectures
and textbook practices only.&nbsp; Bringing real problems into a seminar should
certainly contribute to better motives for the participants, but is often
suppressed by their companies in order to protect their secrecy and intellectual
properties.&nbsp; This problem had to be overcome beforehand.
<P>In this relation, a contradiction which hinders the penetration of TRIZ had
long been recognized :&nbsp; "For beginners to learn TRIZ, good examples of
successful cases are helpful.&nbsp; But the better the application results are,
the less chances to be published because of companies' secrecy policies.&nbsp;
Thus the beginners do not have chances to study good cases, and remain as
beginners."&nbsp; This "TRIZ Case-Study Contradiction" became clear in USA,
Europe, Japan, etc.&nbsp; A solution in USA to bypass this contradiction is the
personal training by many TRIZ experts, Russians and then Americans.&nbsp; Japan
has to find another solution for overcoming it.
<P>Our solution, for bringing in real problems in the seminar and for overcoming
the TRIZ Case-Study Contradiction at the same time, was the Secrecy Agreement
announced beforehand and signed by all the parties involved in the USIT Training
Seminar.&nbsp; Its outline <FONT color=#3333ff>[21]</FONT> is:
<P>Every participant of the seminar should bring in his/her real but
non-confidential problems into the seminar.&nbsp; Among such brought-in
problems, a few should be chosen by the seminar members to practice at the
seminar.&nbsp; All the output of the seminar on a problem are allowed for the
proposing person and his/her company to utilize exclusively for six months after
the seminar, e.g. to file patents.&nbsp; If any contribution by other members is
essential, such members should be named among the inventors but should transfer
all commercial rights to the proposing person and the employer without claiming
any reward.&nbsp; Any participant (including the instructor) other than the
proposing person should not disclose or report even inside his/her company on
any technical issue of the problems for six months.&nbsp; After six months of
the seminar, every participant and the instructor may report/publish the
technical contents of the seminar and may utilize the outputs of the seminar for
his/her own purpose.
<P>With this agreement, four real brought-in problems were chosen to solve at
the seminar and all the participants could discuss on the problems actively and
cooperatively.
<P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>6.2&nbsp; USIT Training Program</FONT></B>
<P>The three-day training program <FONT color=#3333ff>[21]</FONT> is outlined in
Fig. 10.&nbsp; After introductory lectures on TRIZ and USIT, group practices for
solving four real problems in parallel were carried out according to the USIT
procedure. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;

<P>Every session of group practice is composed of
<BLOCKQUOTE>- a short lecture on the step, <BR>- parallel practices in groups
  on the assigned real problem, and <BR>- sequential presentations by the groups
  to all the members, with instructions and discussions.</BLOCKQUOTE>This was
adopted from Sickafus' seminar, and is effective to make the participants highly
motivated.&nbsp; Every participant solves one problem in a three-member group,
and also joins the presentations and discussions of other three problems.
<P>Each problem was analyzed with the Closed World Method and then with the
Particles Method.&nbsp; For the solution generation stage, participants are
advised to proceed as:
<BLOCKQUOTE>- first, to generate solutions using the results of Particles
  Method and Space/Time Characteristics Analysis rather freely, <BR>- then, to
  think more using the four techniques on the results of CW Method, <BR>- at the
  second session, to systematize and examine the solutions with the
  generalization method, <BR>- finally, to select several most promising
  solutions and to enhance and strengthen them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>The participants have solved the four brought-in problems with multiple
solutions successfully and found the USIT process easy and effective.&nbsp; In
coming August, these case studies will be reported publicly including its
technical issues.
<P><B><FONT color=#ff0000>6.3&nbsp; USIT As Evaluated in Japan</FONT></B>
<P>USIT has been evaluated highly in Japan by the audiences and participants of
the seminars: <BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) USIT is much easier to learn than TRIZ. <BR>&nbsp; =&gt; One
  or two USIT experts should be brought up in each company, and they should
  train many engineers in in-company training programs to understand USIT.
  <P>(2) USIT fits well for group work. <BR>&nbsp; =&gt; The USIT experts should
  make temporary joint teams with engineers for solving problems brought in by
  engineering departments, just like the model at Ford [6].
  <P>(3)&nbsp; USIT is applicable to real problems. <BR>&nbsp; =&gt; Application
  should be tried to real industrial problems at their concept-generation stage.

  <P>(4)&nbsp; Engineering details should be considered after USIT. <BR>&nbsp;
  =&gt; (Though the USIT group at Ford is not involved explicitly,) the
  processes for after-USIT stages need to be considered, especially in relation
  to TRIZ software and other designing/quality methodologies.

<P>It should be noticed that the strategy recommended here is in contrast to
those currently typical to the Total Quality Control and related
movements.&nbsp; Main reasoning for the present author's strategy is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>- TRIZ is not understood well yet in Japan in its infancy stage of
  penetration. <BR>- TRIZ is a methodology in technology in its essence.&nbsp;
  Quality control movements have been based on methodologies in data analysis
  and in organization theory, and not in technology itself. <BR>- Grass-root
  penetration has been the unique TRIZ way established by Altshuller. <BR>-
  Thinking with TRIZ should not be enforced on people, to make them creative in
  thinking. <BR>- Hurrying and forcing strategy would cause indigestion and
  harmful effects in a long run.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>The TRIZ methodology is so deep and wide that it should better be
introduced to the field of technologies and industries with the slow-but-steady
way for taking time to understand its real essence in its infancy stage of
penetration in Japan.
