<p>ABSTRACT</p>
</b>
<p>This is our second research paper in comparisons of TRIZ and Axiomatic
Design. In this paper, design problem solving approaches of Axiomatic Design and
TRIZ are analyzed and compared in detail, and several case studies are discussed
to support our point of view about these two methodologies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
</b>
<p>The first research paper in comparisons of TRIZ and Axiomatic Design, these
two methodologies are reviewed and briefly compared. The conclusion is that some
design rules in AD and problem-solving tools in TRIZ are related and share the
same ideas in essence. The objectives of this paper is to compare and contrast
TRIZ and Axiomatic Design problem solving methods in detail, and to discuss the
possibility of integration of them. The long-term goal of this work is to
develop a generic framework and tools to help designers make and understand
correct design decisions.</p>
<p>The body of this paper is divided into five parts. The first part discusses
the domain mapping theory in AD and contradiction transformation idea in TRIZ.
The second and third parts analyze two axioms and their possible corresponding
techniques in TRIZ. The fourth part presents complementarity of these two
methodologies using a case study, and the last part discusses the advantages and
limitations of TRIZ and Axiomatic design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>DOMAIN MAPPING IN AD AND CONTRADICTION TRANSFORMATION IN TRIZ</p>
</b>
<p>AD states that design is the creation of synthesized solutions in the form of
products, processes, or systems that satisfy perceived needs through the mapping
between the FRs in functional domain and the DPs in physical domain, through the
proper selection of DPs that satisfy FRs. To conduct design, one must determine
the design objective by defining it in terms of functional requirements. Then to
satisfy these functional requirements, a physical embodiment characterized in
terms of design parameters must be created. The design process involves relating
these FRs of the functional domain to the DPs of the physical domain.</p>
<p>TRIZ, on the other hand, states that some design problem may be modeled as a
technical contradiction, which is the functional conflict or coupling. A problem
requires creativity when attempts to improve some functional attributes lead to
deterioration of other functional attributes. A design problem associated with a
pair of functional contradiction can be resolved either by finding a trade-off
between the contradictions, or by overcoming it. TRIZ does not accept
trade-offs, and it stresses that an ideal design solution is to overcome the
conflict.</p>
<p>Extensive studies in invention problem solving demonstrate that a functional
contradiction is derived from a physical one. In order to overcome a functional
conflict, one has to identify a physical element of the system that controls the
competing attributes, and this element must be modified in such a way that it
would meet the opposite requirements to its state. Transforming a functional
contradiction in system level into a physical contradiction in component level
is always required in TRIZ. Figure 1 illustrates this idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following Ampoules Sealing case study demonstrates that TRIZ and AD
theory offer the compatible ideas in problem solving.</p>
<i>
<p>Ampoules Sealing Case Study</p>
</i>
<p>In a manufacturing process a burner is used to seal ampoules containing
drugs. The problem is that the flame may overheat the drug in ampoules and
degrade the drugs. What should we do in this situation?</p>
<p>Let us use AD theory and TRIZ to analyze the manufacturing process and then
compare their similarity and differences. From AD standpoint, the functional
requirements in the functional domain of this manufacturing process may be
expressed as two independent requirements that satisfy the Axiom 1.</p>
<p>FR1 = seal ampoules</p>
<p>FR2 = protect drugs from deterioration during the process</p>
<p>The original design selects only one design parameter in its physical domain,
which is:</p>
<p>DP1 = heat by a burner.</p>
<p>There are two FRs but only one DP in the design solution. The number of DPs
is less than the number of FRs. Based on the Theorem 1, the design is either a
coupled design result, or the FRs cannot be satisfied. It is clearly that this
is a coupled design because DP1 affects both FR1 and FR2. The design equation
is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to satisfy two FRs independently, the process design should be
decoupled. Theorem 2 states: when a design is coupled due to the greater number
of FRs than DPs (i.e, <i>m&gt;n</i>), it may be decoupled by addition of new DPs
so as to make the number of FRs and DPs equal to each other. If a subset of the
design matrix containing <i>n<font FACE="Symbol">´</font>n</i> elements, one
can constitute a triangular design matrix to decouple the previous design.</p>
<p>So, the coupled design represented by above equation can be modified into a
decoupled design by adding a DP and changing the design matrix into a triangular
one as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the burner represents DP1, what is DP2? It is obvious that DP2 should
counteract the effect of the heat produced by the burner. In practice, water is
an ideal component to offset the heat. So, the one possible design solution is
given in figure 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image18.gif" WIDTH="407" HEIGHT="241"></p>
</font>
<p>From TRIZ standpoint, this design problem situation can be easily modeled as
the technical contradiction (functional conflict) in the system level: we want
to heat ampoule top (attribute “A”) to seal ampoules but it causes
degradation to medicine (attribute “B”).</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</b>
<p>TRIZ contradiction analysis states that at the heart of a technical
contradiction is hidden a physical one. In order to overcome the technical
contradiction, a physical component should be modified in such a way that it
would meet the opposite requirements. In this ampoule sealing case, the heat
improves “A” (seal), but degrades “B”(medicine in the ampoule). So, the
ampoules should be hot to improve seal, and it should be cold to not damage the
medicine. Clearly the ampoule is the physical component that controls the
technical contradiction.</p>
<p>TRIZ Knowledge Base tools provide several separation principles to overcome
physical contradictions. Three most frequently used principles are separation of
opposite properties in space, separation of opposite properties in time and
separation of opposite properties between whole system and its components.</p>
<p>Careful examination of three separation principles, it is not difficulty to
recognize that separation in space should be used in this situation. In order to
make the top of an ampoule hot and other part cold, it is proposed to surround
the ampoules with a water jacket. The water takes excess heat away from ampoules
to prevent overheating the drag (see figure 2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>INDEPENDENCE AXIOM IN AD AND SEPARATION PRINCIPLES IN TRIZ</p>
</b>
<p>Independence Axiom in AD implies that the design matrix be of a special form.
The consequences of applying Axiom 1 to the design matrix are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is desirable to have a square matrix, i.e., <i>n=m</p>
    </i>
    <p>The matrix should be either diagonal or triangular.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In real design situation, we need to search for DPs that yield a diagonal or
triangular design matrix. The degree of independence can be treated as the
definition of tolerance.</p>
<p>There are a hierarchy in both the functional domain and the physical domain,
and a zigzagging process between two domains in design process. The domain
process is most straightforward when the solution consists of uncoupled design
at each level. When the design is uncoupled, we can deal with the individual FRs
of a hierarchical level without considering other FRs of the same level and
proceeding hierarchical levels. When the design is coupled, we must consider the
effect of a decision on other FRs and DPs. Figure 3 shows the design matrices
and structure models. Therefore, the designer should try to find solutions by
attempting to uncouple or decoupled design in every level of design hierarchy.</p>
<p>The problem is how to decouple a coupled design. It is obvious to modify
design matrix to be either diagonal or triangular. In practice, many coupled
designs undergo changes and become a decoupled design through a trial and error
process that is in opposition to TRIZ methodology.</p>
<p>In TRIZ methodology, a coupled design is defined as the existence of a
contradiction. Removal of dependency of coupling means to overcome a technical
or physical contradiction by applying inventive principles or separation
principles. Thus, these principles can serve, with AD corollaries and theorems,
as the guidelines of de-coupling a coupled design.</p>
<p>The design process of the Paper Handling Mechanism [11] illustrates how
separation principles in TRIZ aid to satisfy Axiom 1 in AD.</p>
<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paper Handling Mechanism Case Study</p>
</i>
<p>The function of the paper handling mechanism used in an automatic teller
machine is “isolate one bill from piled bills”, which is the first FR of the
system. Several physical structures can be used to realize this functional
requirement, such as friction, vacuum and leafing etc. Friction method is
selected and its mechanism is showed in figure 4.</p>
<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image20.gif" WIDTH="251" HEIGHT="173"></p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this DP does not always work correctly because the friction is
changeable under some circumstances. If the friction force working on the tope
of bill becomes too large by some accident, two or more bills will be sent
forwards, and if it becomes too small the top bill may not be isolated. So, we
have to decompose the first level functional requirement into two functional
requirements: “give a forward force to the first bill” and “give a
backward force to the second bill”. To satisfy these two requirements, the new
DP of this design is a pair of rollers rotating in the same direction shown in
figure 5. Furthermore, the friction coefficient of the upper roller is large
than that of the lower roller.</p>
<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image21.gif" WIDTH="243" HEIGHT="168"></p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, the design equation is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
    <p><img SRC="Image22.gif" WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="38"></p>
    </font>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>FR1: give the a forward force to the first bill</p>
<p>FR2: give a backward force to the second bill</p>
<p>DP1: upper roller</p>
<p>DP2: lower roller</p>
<p>A<font SIZE="2">11</font> represents the friction between upper roller and
the first bill; A<font SIZE="2">22</font> is the friction between lower roller
and the second bill. A<font SIZE="2">12</font> and A<font SIZE="2">21</font>
represent the friction between two bills, so A<font SIZE="2">12</font> is equal
to A<font SIZE="2">21</font>. Compared to A<font SIZE="2">11</font> and A<font SIZE="2">22</font>,
A<font SIZE="2">12</font> and A<font SIZE="2">21</font> can be ignored, thus two
requirements can be satisfied independently.</p>
<p>The remaining questions are:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>What happens if there are three or more bills are inserted between the two
    rollers at the same time?</li>
  <li>What happens after the first bill is sent forward if the roller keeps
    rotating?</li>
  <li>What happens when the quality of the bill changes?</li>
</ul>
<p>To solve these problems, the following four more FRs are defined.</p>
<p>FR3: slant the cross section of the piled bills to make isolation easy.</p>
<p>FR4: pull out the isolate bill</p>
<p>FR5: adjust the friction force.</p>
<p>FR6: decrease the forward force after one bill is gone</p>
<p>In AD theory, these six FRs are the minimum set of independent requirements
that completely characterize the design objectives for the specific needs of the
paper handling mechanism. Six DPs in the physical domain are selected as follows
and the mechanism is illustrated in figure 6A.</p>
<p>DP1: upper rollers</p>
<p>DP2: lower roller</p>
<p>DP3: wedge-shaped floor guide</p>
<p>DP4: carriage pinch rollers</p>
<p>DP5: press plate</p>
<p>DP6: cam</p>
<p>However, from TRIZ standpoint, FR1 and FR6 can be viewed as a functional
contradiction because FR1 requires a forward force and FR6 requires a backward
force. In order to satisfy FR1 and FR6, the friction between upper roller and
the first bill should be large and small. Two factors control the friction force
between the upper roller and the first bill: pressure and friction coefficient,
which means either the pressure, or the friction coefficient should be large and
small. Separation of opposite properties in time, one of TRIZ separation
principles, can be utilized because the FR1 and FR6 are not required at the same
time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One design solution, making the pressure large and small, is given in figure
6A. Another design alternative is illustrated in figure 6B. In this design
solution, a partial rubber roller is used to satisfy the requirements, because
its friction coefficient is large at one time and small in another time. So,
only five physical components are needed to realize the six functional
requirements because the partial rubber roller can satisfy FR1 and FR6
independently. Compared with two design alternatives, it is clearly that the
design expressed in figure 6B is better one because of its simple structure.
Simple structure means less information is needed to produce the product (see
the next part).</p>

<p>INFORMATION AXIOM IN AD AND PATTERNS OF TECHNOLOGICAL</p>
<p>SYSTEM EVOLUTION IN TRIZ</p>
</b>
<p>Axiomatic Design theory proposes two design axioms that provide the mechanism
for assessing alternatives at each design. The first axiom is the independence
axiom and the second is the information axiom. The axiom 1 requires that the
functional requirements should be independent. However, the functional coupling
should not be confused with physical coupling, which is often desirable as a
consequence of Axiom 2. Integration of more than one function in a single
physical part, as long as the functions remain independent, should reduce the
information content, i.e., the design complex.</p>
<p>Professor Suh uses Bottle/Can opener design to illustrate the physical
integration without comprising functional independence [1]. The functional
requirements of the Bottle/Can Opener are:</p>
<p>FR1 = open beverage bottles</p>
<p>FR2 = open beverage cans</p>
<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
<p><img SRC="Image23.gif" width="353" height="155"></p>
</font>
<p>By definition, the two FRs are independent. We sometimes wish to open a
bottle or a can, but not both simultaneously.</p>
<p>In the very simple design, the means for achieving the two FRs independently
are embodied in the same physical device rather than in two separate components.
Therefore minimal information content is required to manufacture device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design does not couple the FRs because the act of opening cans does not
interfere with or compromise the requirement of opening bottles. The FRs would
be coupled only if only there were a FR to open bottles and cans simultaneously,
which is not the case here. So the design solution is that two separate
functions are fulfilled by one physical piece without functional coupling. So,
physical integration without functional coupling is advantageous, since the
complexity of the product is reduced.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the same design solution could be obtained if we
applied TRIZ methodology. More importantly and generally, TRIZ offers eight
patterns of evolution of technological systems which allow one to identify the
most effective direction for the system’s development.</p>
<p>In Bottle/Can opener example, at least two patterns might be used to predict
or explain why two functions should be integrated into one physical device
without coupling.</p>
<p>The first pattern is the Evolution toward Increase Ideality, which states
that evolution of all the technological system proceeds in the direction of
increasing degree of ideality. This means that in the process of evolution
either the system of performing a certain functions gets less complicated/cost,
or the system becomes capable of performing its function better or perform more
functions than for which it was original designed. The ideality may be expressed
as the equation as:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
    <p><img SRC="Image24.gif" width="12" height="22"><img SRC="Image25.gif" WIDTH="311" HEIGHT="41"></p>
    </font>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on this equation, it is clearly that the degree of ideality of
Bottle/Can opener is bigger than that of two single openers (Bottle and Can).
The reason is that functions of bottle/can opener are the same as that of two
individual openers, but manufacturing cost is reduced. In terms of AD theory,
the information content of one bottle/can is less than that of two individual
openers. So, the conclusion is that the ideality in terms of TRIZ and the
information axiom of AD theory are the compatible parameters in assessment of
technological system and design solution. The pattern “Evolution toward
Increase Ideality” in TRIZ is compatible with the Information Axiom in AD.</p>
<p>The second applicable pattern is “Increased Complexity Followed by
Simplification”. This pattern consists of several evolution lines and “Line
Mono-Bi-Poly” fits very well in predicting and interpreting this Bottle/Can
Opener design solution. From TRIZ standpoint, bottle opener and can opener are
two simple mono function systems. “Line Mono-Bi-Poly” states: if the
technological system is a mono-system, it evolves by changing it to a bi-system.
If it is a bi-system, it evolves to a poly-system. A single-barreled hunting
rifle evolves to a two-barreled hunting rifle and its mono-functional
performance is doubled. However, wristwatch calculator is a bi-function device
by integrating two functions, measuring time and doing calculation, into a
physical device. It is clearly that this pattern also satisfies the Axiom 2
because the new system enhances functions of the previous system in the limit
cost. We should note that the evolution of technological system along the line
of “Mono-Bi-Poly” does not violate the Independence Axiom.</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KNOWLEDGE BASE TOOLS IN TRIZ AND ANALYTICAL METHODS IN AD</p>
</b>
<p>Many case studies in applying AD theory, related to manufacturing process,
material process, product design, software development, have been published in
recent years. These applications illustrate how Axiom 1 and Axiom 2 can be used
in solving real problems. By examination of these case studies, we find that
many decisions can be made qualitatively if we understand the basic engineering
principles, physical and chemical effects. To proceed with the design task,
engineers need a database and computers. The database should contain sufficient
knowledge to make the computer to communicate with the designer and to give the
designer information about plausible design solution [12].</p>
<p>AD offers two design axioms and several theorems and corollaries, but it has
not developed such a knowledge base yet to support these design rules. Therefor,
in AD theory framework the engineering problem solving mainly depends on the
engineer’s personal background and knowledge. A study shows that an average
engineer knows usually 50-100 physical effects and phenomena, while there are
more than 6,000 physical effects described in scientific literature [5]. Each
effect may be a key to solving a large group of problems. Since engineering
students are not usually taught how to apply these effects to practical
situation, they often have problems with utilization of such well-know effects
as thermal expansion or frequency resonance, let alone with less recognized
effects. So, when applying AD to the product or manufacturing process design, an
average engineer likely encounters problems such as what effects should be used
and how to apply them.</p>
<p>Motivated by the need to help engineers to apply some physical and chemical
effects in the engineering problem solving, TRIZ effect knowledge base has been
developed in the past decades. This knowledge base is built on a functional
principle: it contains a list of functions (applications) that commonly
encountered in practice, and a corresponding list effects and application
examples that serve as the guidelines to realize these functions. By integrating
this TRIZ knowledge base into AD theory, the effectiveness of problem solving
can be enhanced tremendously.</p>
<p>Here is the case study from the book [1]. We use this example to demonstrate
how this TRIZ knowledge base can aid to solve real problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Method and Apparatus for Mixture Solid Particles Case Study</p>
</i>
<p>The dry mixing of fine powder is a very difficulty process, as they tend to
segregation as a function of particle size; to agglomerate, forming clumps, and
to compact into a cake. However, a “perfect” mixture is desired in many
applications. A perfect mixture is defined as one in each component is evenly
distributed throughout the mixture, so that with reference to the smallest
sample, of interest, the ratio of particle components in every such sample is
the same as the ratio of components in the entire mixture.</p>
<p>In order to realize a perfect mixture of two components, Professor Suh
proposed a method and designed an apparatus [1]. Two different powder A and B,
are stored in separate containers, through which air flows. The air stream
carries the particles and conveys them to channels that direct the flow of
particles past corona discharge devices. The corona devices have high voltage
corona point electrodes and ground electrodes. One of the electrodes is supplied
with a positive voltage with respect to ground, and other electrode is supplied
with a negative voltage with respect to ground. The corona discharge across the
electrode ionizes the air particles. The ionized air particles combined with the
particle A and B as they pass between the electrodes, so as to impart a positive
and negative charge on the particles, respectively.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
<p><img SRC="Image26.gif" WIDTH="307" HEIGHT="325"></p>
</font>
<p>Since the particles in each stream are charged with the same charge, the
stream spreads as each stream leaves the region of each corona discharge device.
As they enter a mixing chamber, the streams of oppositely charged particle
attract each other, so particles of one charge tend to pair up with particles of
the other charge as both streams are conveyed down through the mixing chamber
(see figure 8).</p>
<p>Professor Suh and his associates considered all plausible solutions in
physical domain, then they came to the conclusion that corona effects should be
used. In the book Suh analyzed how the design solution satisfy Axiom 1 in
detail, but how they came up with the idea of utilizing corona effect remained
as somewhat nebulous and protracted.</p>
<p>At this point, applying TRIZ knowledge base may help us to generate the
possible solution. In this case, the highest level functional requirement (FR)
is to combine particle A with particle B. It is clearly that the problem is to
realize the required function and TRIZ physical, chemical and geometric effect
knowledge base can help to come up with design concept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Effect Knowledge base in TRIZ does not offer “function of mixture of
particles” but it does have the inverse function, “separation of substance”.
In order to realize the function of “separating particles of substances”,
the knowledge base offers us the following effects [10]:</p>
<font SIZE="3">
</p><ul>
  <li>Adsorption</li>
  <li>Archimdes’ principle</li>
  <li>Corona discharge</li>
  <li>Coulomb’s law</li>
  <li>Crystallization</li>
  <li>Electrolysis</li>
  <li>Ferromagnetism</li>
  <li>Forced oscillations</li>
  <li>Lamina flow</li>
  <li>Neutron action</li>
  <li>Oxidation by oxygen</li>
  <li>Oxidation by ozone</li>
  <li>Ranque effect</li>
  <li>Silent discharge</li>
  <li>Turbulent flow</li>
  <li>Vibration</li>
  <li>Wetting</li>
</ul>
</font>
<p>The Effect Knowledge base suggests that these physical and chemical effects
should be considered when you want to separate particles of substances. By
careful examination of these effects and analysis of examples, it is not
difficult for us to come to the conclusion that corona effect and Coulomb’s
Law could be applied to both separate and mix particles of substance.</p>
<p>If particle A and B have same electrostatic charges, they are exclusive.
However, opposite electrostatic charges provide internal forces among particles.
So, a perfect mixture might be realized if component A takes positive charge and
B negative charge. In order to make particles A and B have the opposite charges,
they should combine with the ionized air particles as they pass between the
electrodes, so as to impart a positive and negative charge on the particles,
respectively.</p>
<p>The task of TRIZ is finished at this functional level once the design idea of
mixing two powders by means of electric field is derived. The further design
process, how the idea is realized by physical structure, depends on the proper
application of AD analytical analysis method. Actually AD decomposes the highest
functional requirements into several low-level requirements through zigzagging
process. For each functional requirement at the low level, TRIZ may find its new
applications. In this way, AD approach may be viewed as analytical tool and TRIZ
as synthesis tool. They are complementary very well in the real problem solving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS</p>
</b>
<p>Several examples given above have demonstrated that TRIZ fits very well into
the “ideation and create” element of axiomatic design process. In these
examples, TRIZ knowledge base tools make the nebulous searching process for an
acceptable design solution clear if the design problem could be traced into a
particular area of design hierarchy.</p>
<p>However, as the systematic design methodology, axiomatic design does have
several advantages in creating and evaluating a system structure.</p>
<font SIZE="2"></font>
</p><ol>
  <li>In AD theory, the design process is defined as the development and
    selection of a means to satisfy objects, subject to constraints. It is
    series steps, or activities, by which inputs are transformed to an output.
    This transformation occurs by means of the designer assistant by design
    tools/methods and knowledge base. The design object may be a physical
    object, a manufacturing process, a software or an organization, whatever the
    customer is willing to accept. However, TRIZ confines its application to
    technological systems since its methods, tools and knowledge base are from
    patent database. There are very few case studies in the fields of software
    development and organization structure design.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li>AD places careful emphasis on the importance of recognizing the
    hierarchical nature of design, and particularly to ensuring that the process
    of iteration between FRs in functional domain and DPs in physical domain is
    carried out in a systematic manner. In general, a system, especially a
    complex one, cannot be designed without zigzagging and decomposing to create
    FR and DP hierarchy. This systemization occurs through an essentially
    top-down approach. Definition of system level FRs permits derivation and
    iteration of system level DPs, and then most importantly-definition of the
    system level DPs is necessary before FRs at the next level down in the
    hierarchy may occur; and so on right through each level of the hierarchy.
    The designer follows this zigzagging approach, checking the correctness of
    the design at each level using two axioms, until he has decomposed the
    problem to a point where the solution to the remaining sub-problem is known.
    In effect, AD suggests that the final solution of top level FRs can only
    really be achieved after each layer of the problem hierarchy has been given
    due consideration and iterated accordingly. TRIZ methodology models a design
    problem either as a technical contradiction that might be overcome by the
    contradiction table, or as the substance-field model that 76 Standard
    Solutions may aid to find the design solutions. These two models do not pay
    much attention to the hierarchical nature of the product system, so they
    only work well in the individual design level.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li>In AD, two design axioms provide a rational means for evaluating the
    quality of proposed designs so that design decision may be made on a
    rational basis, support by easily understood math models and analytical
    results. The simple math models guide designers to consider alternatives at
    all levels of detail and makes choices between these alternatives more
    explicit. On the other hand, TRIZ use very abstract terms to express its
    theory and method, and it lacks math models and quantitative methodology to
    support its applications. For a new practitioner, it is very hard to follow
    its principles and others techniques.<br>

<p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
</b>
</p><ol>
  <li>Axiomatic design perspectives on functional, physical and process
    hierarchies in the design of a system offer a powerful analytical tool to
    design problem. Two axioms and several corollaries and theorems serve as
    guidelines for problem solving, and easy understanding math models provide
    quantitative criteria to evaluate design alternatives. However, Axiomatic
    design lacks the vast knowledge base to support the application of its
    theory, so the creative process of conceptualizing and devising a solution
    is not very clear.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li>TRIZ models a practical problem to be either a contradiction, or a
    substance-field model, or a simple function requirement, which serve the
    first step to problem solving. The second step is to apply its knowledge
    base tools to search for possible ideas, which guide designer to the
    suitable design solution. Since TRIZ concentrates its study on the
    individual part of a technical system, it is very useful in dealing with one
    functional requirement situation, but in multi-objective situation or
    multi-level system structure its limitations are obvious. TRIZ consists of
    both analytical and knowledge base tools, however, its knowledge base tools
    are used much more frequently in practical design world.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li>The basic foundations of TRIZ and Axiomatic Design methodology are
    compatible. Several case studies in this paper show that in the framework of
    axiomatic design, integration of TRIZ knowledge base tools with axiomatic
    design analytical methods aids to come up with design concepts and make the
    design process clear. On the base of TRIZ methodology, hierarchical idea for
    a design process in axiomatic design enhances TRIZ problem solving
    abilities, especially in the complicated system situation.<br>
