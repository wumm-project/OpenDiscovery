<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introduction</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, more than ever, engineers are faced with the need for
rapid development of creative solutions to their problems. But what is
creativity? Can we define what we are looking for? Often people are careful not
to define creativity, as it is such a complex phenomenon. Furthermore, teaching
creativity becomes fostering, nurturing, stimulating or allowing creativity.
This article suggests that it is possible to enhance a creative potential and
therefore the chances of a creative solution by employing structured approaches,
such as TRIZ.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The article focuses on a case study, described in the
reference, concerning a novel design for a spinning nose-cone found on the front
of a gas-turbine engine (Figure 1). The case offers a comparison between
traditional un-structured creativity methods and the systematic process offered
by TRIZ.</p>

of the definitions and findings from UK Government sponsored Imperial College
research:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Creativity - A Working Definition</p>
</i></font><font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The necessity for an appropriate definition for the Imperial
research project lead to the construction of a working definition as follows: <b><i>Creativity
is shared imagination.</p>
</i></b></font><font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p>The creativity becomes an innovation when an application becomes apparent and
if it is non-domain specific it becomes an invention i.e. a motorcycle is an
innovation consisting of inventions like the wheel and the engine.</p>
</font><font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p>In order to enhance creativity in engineering, we can focus on aspects which
affect the engineers potential to be creative.</p>

Figure 2: Potential Creativity Model</p>
</font></i></b><font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p>The Figure 2 model above expresses a tension zone to be optimised. Developing
this creative potential depends entirely upon internal or external perceptual
filtering.</p>
<i>
<p>Engineering problem solving approach</p>
</i>
<p>If we provide the ideal environment for the development of creative
potential, an idea may emerge through subconscious association, or incubation,
often after a period of relaxed attention or even using a basic trial and error
method. However, various procedures have been developed intentionally to move an
individual away from habitual pathways of thinking. These procedures enlarge the
individual’s working memory thereby increasing the source for association.
(E.g. analogy with nature)</p>
<p>The figure below draws out a solving procedure. A gas-turbine nose spinner is
frozen. One ‘obvious’<i> </i>solution route suggests heating of the spinner,
as the ‘normal’ way of removing ice is to melt it. Reformulating the problem
to ‘removing the ice’ however, creates a distinctly different route. The
figure illustrates a structure of how the spinner could have been derived using
traditional creativity methods.</p>
<p>Note how even if the problem owner had successfully made the paradigm shift
away from a typical psychological inertia bound ‘remove ice by heating/melting
it’, to the idea of removing the ice by other means - in this case using a
rubber-tip on the end of the spinner - a quite considerable leap of the
imagination is required. In fact, Reference 1 uses the example as a
demonstration of the unmeasurable, unpredictable nature of creativity,
describing the moment of inspiration which produced the solution as something
‘dreamt up overnight in a classic case of incubation’.</p>

<p>A TRIZ Approach</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p>Approaching the same problem using TRIZ, we might immediately see the
nose-cone icing problem as a contradiction. In common with many gas-turbine
related problems, the industry knows how to remove ice from nose-cone spinners.
Traditional design solutions to the problem come with a certain weight and
power-loss penalty. Thus a designer might be motivated to look for alternative
means of removing ice from the nose-cone in order to reduce one or both of these
penalties.</p>
<p>In actual fact, we can observe that the two parameters are in contradiction.
For example, if we were motivated to reduce weight, switching from a metal to a
composite material is a well known solution route. The problem - as far as the
nose-cone is concerned - of switching to a composite is that such materials
conduct heat less well and thus more energy has to be supplied in order to
remove any ice which may accrete on the surface.</p>
<p>In terms of the Contradiction Matrix, we thus have a WEIGHT versus USE OF
ENERGY (BY MOVING OBJECT) contradiction. The Matrix recommends Inventive
Principles:-</p>
<p>35 - Parameter Changes</p>
<p>12 - Equi-potentiality</p>
<p>34 - Discarding and Recovering, and</p>
<p>31 - Porous Materials</p>
<p>as good solution directions adopted by other inventors facing similar
contradictions.</p>
<p>While all of these appear to have some potential relevance to the problem at
hand, the first, Parameter Changes, offers some very striking solution
directions. As described in Reference 2, the Principle is interpreted in several
ways:-</p>
</font><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">
<p>-</font><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#000000"> </font><font SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">change
an object’s physical state (e.g. to a gas, liquid or solid)</p>
<p>- change the concentration or constituency</p>
<p>- change the degree of flexibility</p>
<p>- change the temperature</p>
</font><font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p>Again, the Principle contains several solution triggers which point very
specifically in the direction of the previously described rubber-tip -
particularly the idea of increasing the flexibility of the system.</p>
<p>Whether or not one believes in 20/20 hindsight and the fact that it is much
easier to reverse engineer from an existing solution, the case very specifically
highlights the fact that the structure offered by TRIZ does point problem
solvers in very fruitful solution directions. That being said, it is also worth
noting that the method still leaves the problem solver with a deal of creative
thinking to do. In this sense, TRIZ acts as a very good focus for subsequent
creative efforts - for example, in an actual situation, a problem solving group
might be asked to brainstorm connections between the nose-cone problem and the
‘Parameter Changes’ solution trigger. TRIZ may thus be seen as highly
complementary to other creativity tools and techniques.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Inventive Principle 35 - Parameter Changes</p>
</b>
<p>Use of Inventive Principle 35 in the nose-cone example above, highlights the
value of the Principle. Further comment on the importance of the Principle may
be in order:-</p>
<blockquote>
</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000000">
<p>‘</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008080">Parameter Changes</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000000">’
is the most commonly cited and applied of the 40 Inventive Principles (Reference
3, plus research at the University of Bath)</p>
<p>Recommendation of </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008080">Parameter
Changes</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000000"> by the Matrix
usually implies that a system is approaching the mature end of its evolution
S-curve, and is often a strong indicator that shifts from mechanical to fluid to
gaseous to fields are necessary if improvements are to be produced.</p>
<p>It is a particularly strong indicator that the need for the major mechanical</font><font FACE="Symbol" COLOR="#000000">®</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000000">hydraulic,
hydraulic</font><font FACE="Symbol" COLOR="#000000">®</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000000">pneumatic,
and hydraulic/pneumatic</font><font FACE="Symbol" COLOR="#000000">®</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000000">field
transitions are emerging.</p>
<p>The ‘increase the degree of flexibility’ trigger is another powerful
message; one which often flies in the direct opposite direction to ‘traditional’
design instincts to increase the stiffness of systems rather than go the other
way. Some designers fight the ‘increase flexibility’ direction quite
vociferously despite powerful evidence that the TRIZ recommendation is actually
a much more powerful solution direction.</p>

<p>Conclusions</p>
</b></font>
<blockquote>
  <font FACE="Times New Roman">
  <p>While it is always simpler to see good ideas in retrospect, it is hoped
  that the article has shown how TRIZ provides systematic route by which the
  spinner idea could have been derived.</p>
  <p>TRIZ offers very good solution ‘triggers’. Beyond these triggers, all
  the creative energy’s of the problem solver are required to produce a
  specific solution. In such instances, there is much common ground between TRIZ
  and the many available unstructured creativity methods.</p>
  <p>Inventive Principle 35, ‘Parameter Changes’ is a particularly important
  member of the family of Inventive Principles.</p>
