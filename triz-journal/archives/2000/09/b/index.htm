<p ALIGN="CENTER">Investigating the use TRIZ tools in Eco-Innovation</p>
</font>
<p>1. Introduction</p>
</b><font SIZE="3">
<p>This paper aims to identify ways in which tools and methodologies from TRIZ
might be used in Eco-Innovation and subsequently how TRIZ might be adapted for
that specific purpose.</p>
<p>Eco-innovation is the process of developing new products, processes or
services which provide customer and business value but significantly decrease
environmental impact (James, 1997). Eco-innovation is one of several approaches
towards sustainable design.</p>
<p>The authors became interested in TRIZ after identifying some overlap in the
philosophies of TRIZ and sustainable design. Sustainable design is one part of a
global movement towards sustainable development which is driven by the
realisation that society cannot continue current modes of production and
consumption without serious ecological damage. One commonly quoted definition of
sustainable development is ‘development which meets the needs of a current
generation without compromising the ability of a future generation to meet their
needs’ (the Bruntland Commission, 1987). One fundamental concept of TRIZ is
that all systems will evolve towards an increased degree of ideality: an ideal
system being one that does not exist but its function is delivered (Salamatov,
1999). Innovation following this law of ideality could contribute to sustainable
development, through the delivery of the functions without the environmental
impacts associated with current systems of production.</p>
<p>First, the authors looked briefly at the overlap between one Eco-Innovation
tool (the Eco-compass) and one TRIZ tool (the contradiction matrix). From this
part of the study the authors identified one way in which TRIZ might be adapted
for use in Eco-Innovation.</p>
<p>TRIZ shows how it is possible to develop useful innovation tools by
extracting generic principles from patents. The second approach taken by the
authors was to study the patents of environmentally designed products currently
available. These environmentally designed products are referred to as ‘Eco-innovation
exemplars’. This paper reports on the development of energy efficient lighting
and presents a detailed study of a chosen ‘Eco-innovation exemplar’ patent
from fluorescent tube lighting. From this part of the study the authors gained
several insights into the ways in which TRIZ might be used in Eco-Innovation.</p>

<p>2. Two approaches to sustainable design: Ecodesign and Eco-Innovation</p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p>2.1 Eco-design and business example Philips</p>
</font></b><font SIZE="3">
<p>Ecodesign aims to reduce the environmental impact of the product throughout
its life cycle: from materials extraction, through production processes,
packaging and transport, product use phase, and finally to end-of-life disposal.
Ecodesign includes the use of quantitative environmental analysis tools such as
Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) tools. The results from Ecodesign are limited because
it is a design specific activity that focuses on the redesign or optimisation of
<b>existing</b> products. The changes to the products tend to be incremental and
result only in percentile reduction of the overall environmental impact of the
products (Hoed, 1997).</p>
<p>However Ecodesign can improve a company’s competitive advantage by
supporting expansion into new markets, through the launch of new versions of
products with environmental attributes which consumers desire. Philips for
example launched a range of ‘green products’ in 1998 (</font><font SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000">Philips
Electronics, 1998</font><font SIZE="3">) and has had corporate environmental
commitment since 1987 when they issued their first environmental policy. They
have long regarded environmental care as a business opportunity, where the
corporate ‘Green Image’ is of great value to the compnay both externally and
internally (Meinders, 1999). Such an environmentally proactive company may also
benefit financially from the optimisation of production processes, reduced
material use, and reduced waste generation.</p>
</font><b><font SIZE="3">
<p>2.2 Eco innovation and business example Electrolux</p>
</font></b><font SIZE="3">
<p>Eco-innovation is one step beyond Ecodesign and aims to develop <b>new</b>
products and services that are not based on redesign or incremental changes to
the existing product but rather on providing the consumer with the <b>function</b>
that they require in the most Eco-efficient way. Examples of such
function-oriented redesign are solutions that ‘dematerialise’ the product
and replace it by a service. An example of such a ‘product to service shift’
is a network based telephone answer service, which is replacing electronic
answering machines. These telephone answer services are accessed by a standard
telephone and require no other hardware in the home, thereby removing the
production, materials, packaging and logistics impacts of the electronic
product. Current environmental research programs are investigating the impact of
these product to service shifts (Low, IEEE, 2000).</p>
<p>A second example of a product to service shift is the launch of a new
business pilot scheme from Electrolux on the island of Gotland in Sweden (</font><font SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000">Electrolux,
</font><font SIZE="3">[http://193.183.104.77/node323.asp], </font><font SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000">2000</font><font SIZE="3">).
They have called it Functional Sales (see figure 1), and together with the
energy utility company Vattenfall, Electrolux offers a pay-per-wash option for
the participants' laundry needs. Customers do not buy their washing machine but
do have one in their home. Customers are paying for only the “<b>function</b>”
of Clean Clothes; they are paying for the number of usages. This creates
incentives for customer to reduce the number of usages and thereby reduce the
energy and detergent consumption. Customers can choose to upgrade to washers
with larger capacity.</p>

<p>This type of product to service shift could have significant effects on the
way the product is designed. To suit these business models, companies will have
to design their products with increased endurance, serviceability and
refurbishment capability which, in turn, will reduce the products overall
environmental impact. These business models may well spread to other areas and
may change the way we design our appliances in the future.</p>

<p>3. An Eco-Innovation tool in relation to contradiction matrix</p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p>3.1 The Eco-compass</p>
</font></b><font SIZE="3">
<p>A number of tools have been developed to support the process of
Eco-innovation such as the Life-cycle Design Strategy (LiDS) wheel (Brezet et
al., 1996) and the Eco-compass (Fussler &amp; James, 1996). Both these tools
condense environmental information and provide ‘streamlined’ methods to
compare the environmental merits of a new proposal against the original design.</p>
</font><font SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000">
<p>The Eco-compass (Fussler &amp; James, 1996) is one of the most successful
streamlined Eco-innovation tools. The Eco-compass was designed to condense
environmental data into a simple model, which would assist in the integration of
environmental issues within the business decision process.</p>
<p>The compass has six poles or ‘axes’, which are intended to represent all
significant environmental issues (see Figure 2): mass intensity, reducing human
health and environmental risk, energy intensity, reuse and revalorization of
wastes, resource conservation and extending service and function.</p>
<p>The Eco-compass is a comparative spider diagram, which evaluates new options
or designs against the original design or ‘base case’. Each of the axes
records a score from 0-5 for the new product. The base case always scores 2 in
each dimension and the new option can score from 0 (environmental impact
doubled) to 5 (environmental impact reduced by at least factor 4).</p>

</font><u><font SIZE="3">
<p>Mass Intensity</font></u><font SIZE="3"> (<i>the quantity of material used
per unit service</i>): is the amount of materials in the product viewed from a
life-cycle perspective. It considers knock-on effects such as: amount of raw
materials extracted, transport energy, and packaging required. Each material
used in the product has a hidden material ‘rucksack’ of environmental
effects such as erosion, earth displacement and waste of unconverted materials.</p>
</font><u><font SIZE="3">
<p>Energy Intensity</font></u><font SIZE="3"> (<i>quantity energy used per unit
service</i>): is the energy consumption at all stages of the product’s
lifetime. The production and consumption of energy produces pollution and waste
materials. When derived from fossil fuels energy production depletes
non-renewable resources as well as generating carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<u>
<p>Extending Service and Function</u> (<i>increasing quantity of functional
units in the product</i>): considers ways of delivering more service to
customers from a given amount of environmental inputs. This can be achieved by
increasing product: durability, reparability, upgradeability,
multi-functionality or shared use of the product.</p>
</font><u><font SIZE="3">
<p>Health and Environmental Risk</font></u><font SIZE="3"> (<i>quantity of
hazardous substances emitted to air soil and water</i>): Toxicologists try first
to identify the ways in which a product or process creates health and
environmental risks. Secondly, to consider the importance of the risk
identified. Identifying hazardous substances and setting reduction targets is an
ongoing process. Eco-innovation helps to meet these targets.</p>
<u>
<p>Resource Conservation</u> (<i>quantity of scarce or depleting resources used</i>):
Focuses on the nature and re-newability of the energy and materials needed for a
product or process. It considers the overall impact of specific resource needs.</p>
<u>
<p>Revalorization</u> (<i>quantity of waste not Eco-efficiently recycled</i>):
includes several different approaches to waste. The main aim is to close the
loop on materials and products by recycling (converting wastes back into raw
materials) re-use and remanufacturing (refurbishment of complete products or
components).</p>

order to become acquainted with TRIZ fundamentals.</p>
<p>Studying the axes of the contradiction matrix or the ‘engineering

the headings on the Eco-compass axes (See figure 3). However, it also revealed
that the Eco-innovation issues: Health and environmental Risk, Revalorization
and Resource Conservation, are only blanket covered under the engineering
parameter ‘harmful-side effects’.</p>

<p>4. Case study of current best-practise Eco-Innovation: the development of

<p>In this part of the study the authors wanted to study a collection </font><font SIZE="3">of
best available environmentally designed products which we have called ‘Eco-innovation
exemplars’. The sunbject chosen was energy efficient lighting. Without any
sophisticated patent searching software the authors needed to study the
development of energy efficient lighting to be able to select the </font><font SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000">most
relevant products and select a limited time span over which to study their
patents.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>4.1 The CFL and innovation</p>
</b>
<p>The authors wanted to select the most relevant product in energy efficient
lighting and immediately thought of the compact fluorescent lamp (CFL). CFLs use
a quarter of the amount of energy for the same unit function as a standard
incandescent light bulb and have at least a 10 times longer service life.</p>

</font><font SIZE="3">
<p>The following example of the replacement of the incandescent light bulb, with
Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) was published by Weizsacher et al. (1997):</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Global market currently consumes 10.000 million incandescent light
    bulbs per year. 200 million CFL were sold in 1994 and the figures are
    steadily rising by 15-20 % each year. These light bulbs last 10 times
    longer, which means that they are effectively replacing 2000 million
    incandescent light bulbs. The replacement of one 75W with an 18W compact
    fluorescent can, over its lifetime, save: at least energy value of 200
    litres of oil for oil fired electricity production.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Times" SIZE="3">
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
</font><font SIZE="3">
<p>From studying the development of lamp technologies the authors found there
were many environmentally relevant innovations in ordinary fluorescent tube
lamps. CFLs were often secondary adopters of technologies such as the improved
phosphors and high frequency dimmable ballasts. For these reasons conventional
fluorescent tube lighting was chosen as the product for the rest of this study.</p>

<p>4.4 Detailed patent study of a fluorescent tube lamp</p>
</font></b><font SIZE="3">
<p>Having compiled the patent profile of fluorescent tube lighting, the authors
wanted to get an insight into the type of contradictions solved in
environmentally relevant patents. To do this, such patents would need to be
studied in more detail. This section reports on the first of these more detailed
patent studies.</p>
<p>The patent chosen from the patent profile fluorescent tube lighting was
US5898265: Toxic Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) compliant fluorescent
lamp. The TCLP test is a toxicity test established in 1990 by EPA to prevent
large quantities of heavy metal going to landfill. The patent records a
combination of innovations that lead to environmental (TCLP) compliance for a
fluorescent tube lamp, and must therefore contain </font><font SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000">environmentally
relevant innovations</font><font SIZE="3">. The patent describes the reduction
of the total mercury content by more than 80% (factor 4) whilst providing a
lamp-life and photometric quality comparable to other commercially available
fluorescent lamps. These lamps no longer pose danger in landfill and can be
safely disposed of in landfill whilst also still being 100% recyclable, a more
expensive disposal option. Competitors’ lamps often use mercury-binding agents
that ‘cheat’ the TCLP test</font><font SIZE="3" COLOR="#ff0000">.</p>
</font><font SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000">
<p>Press releases from the patent owners (Philips, [http://www.eur.lighting.philips.com],
2000) and product brochures of the fluorescent tube lamps ‘Alto’ and ‘TL’D
Super 80’ supplemented the information contained in the patent. These helped
the authors understand the environmental benefits of the innovations described
in the patent.</p>
</font><b><font SIZE="3">
<p>4.5 Breakdown of patent showing the ‘Environmental contradiction’ and
solutions hierarchy</p>
</font></b><font SIZE="3">
<p>From the patent it was clear that the company had made a strategic commitment
to try to develop a lamp that would pass the TCLP test without cheating whilst
still producing a lamp that would be competitive. In real terms this meant that,
to pass this test they would have to reduce the mercury content of standard
fluorescent tubes by at least 75% whilst achieving an energy efficient, 20.000
hour lamp life.</p>
<p>From the company’s strategic point of view the ‘Environmental
contradiction’ was between remaining competitive in the lighting market and
complying with environmental legislation without cheating. Figure 7 shows the
‘Environmental contradiction’ that the company was trying to solve between
lamp performance characteristics and harmful materials in lamps.</p>
</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><img SRC="Image17.gif" WIDTH="554" HEIGHT="385"></font><font FACE="Times" SIZE="3"><br>
</font><font SIZE="3">Figure 7 breakdown of patent US5898265.</p>
<p>The lamp’s life-time is affected by mercury absorption in the glass
envelope over time, electrode failure and tube blackening from spitting
electrodes. The lamp’s energy consumption is affected by the efficiency of the
phosphors to convert the UV radiation into visible light. Figure 7 shows the
combined approach described in the patent which addresses all these performance
factors (see columns 1,2 and 5).</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The use of the best tri-chromatic phosphors that efficiently convert
      the UV radiation into three main bandwidths of visible light, namely, red,
      green and blue.</p>
      <p>The small metal shields around the cathodes inside the tube catch the
      spitting from the cathodes that otherwise cause the tube to blacken and
      thereby shorten its life.</p>
      <p>Over time the amount of mercury vapour inside the bulb slowly decreases
      due to its absorption in the phosphor layers and the glass envelope.
      Special ‘barrier’ coatings help to reduce this effect.</p>
    </font><font FACE="Times" SIZE="3">
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
</font><font SIZE="3">
<p>The most innovative part of the patent is shown in column 3 and 4 of figure
7. Traditionally lamps have always been overdosed with mercury. This was done
because the actual mercury absorption rates in the tube were unknown and
manufacturing techniques were inaccurate. This patent describes the method for
calculating the minimum mercury dosage required for competitive lamp life and a
novel manufacturing method that accurately inserts that minimum dose in the tube
(see columns 3 and 4).</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The extremely low dose of mercury is accurately
      inserted in the tube by containing it within a small glass capsule, which
      is mounted on one of the end guards in the tube. There is a metal wire
      encircling this glass capsule. After the production of lamp is complete,
      the sealed glass capsule is heated inductively by a high frequency
      electromagnetic field which causes the wire to cut the glass capsule and
      release the mercury into the tube.</p>
    </font><b><font FACE="Times" SIZE="3">

    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</font><font SIZE="3">
<p>4.6 TRIZ in this patent</p>
</font></b><font SIZE="3">
<p>From studying the abstract of the patent, the innovation could be defined as
the solution to the contradiction between the following parameters: ‘ harmful
side effects’ (the mercury in land fill from fluorescent tubes) and ‘durability
of a non-moving objects’ (achieving a competitive lamp-life for the product).</p>
<p>Studying the patent in more depth revealed that several inventions are
brought together in this patent. These innovations solve contradictions between
other parameters including ‘brightness’, ‘waste of substance’, ‘amount
of substance’, and ‘accuracy of manufacture’.</p>
<p>The novel manufacturing method described in section 4.5 uses the following of
the 40 inventive principles described in TRIZ:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <u>
    <p>No. 7 Nesting:</u> of the glass capsule inside the tube envelope;</p>
    <u>
    <p>No.28 Replace Mechanical:</u> to break the capsule a high frequency
    electromagnetic field was used;</p>
    <u>
    <p>No. 37 Thermal Expansion:</u> the difference in the coefficients of heat
    expansion of the metal wire and the glass capsule cause mercury to be
    released.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Times" SIZE="3">
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
</font><b>
<p>5. Discussion</p>
</b><font SIZE="3">
<p>The patent studied (see figure 7), shows that the environmental issues are
present at the systems level of the problem hierarchy. This supports other
sources in Eco-innovation that emphasise the need for top-down management
commitment for Eco-innovation (Cramer &amp; Stevels, 1997).</p>
<p>As we move down into the problem hierarchy the environmental element
disappears. The problems are ordinary technical problems that could be defined
as conventional technical or physical contradictions.</p>
<p>Looking closely at the patents studied reveals that, the innovations
described in the patents all concern redesign or optimisation of existing
lighting products and therefore should only have been only be defined as ‘<b>Eco-design</b>
exemplars’ (see section 2). It will be much more difficult to find patented
products which would be true ‘Eco-innovation exemplars’.</p>
</font><b><font SIZE="3">
<p>5.1 How TRIZ might be used in Eco-innovation</p>
</font></b><font SIZE="3">
<p>Technical or physical contradiction solving through the use of Existing TRIZ
tools such as the 40 principles, SU field analysis, 76 standards or the
separation principles could help generate <b>new</b> solutions to problems
encountered in sustainable design.</p>
<p>The TRIZ principle of ideality and the 20 defined trends of evolution for
technical systems could help existing technical systems evolve towards ideality,
where the functions of that system are delivered without the environmental
impacts currently associated. In a follow up paper the authors will show how SU
field analysis can be used to evolve the fluorescent tube one step further along
its evolutionary path towards ideality.</p>
<p>The TRIZ principle of problem solving without compromise could contribute to
sustainable design. TRIZ identifies the ‘core’ problems through the
definition of contradictions that are to be solved. This aspect of TRIZ may help
to prevent typical ‘add-on’ or ‘end-of-pipe’ solutions, not desired in
Eco-innovation.</p>
<b>
<p>5.2 How TRIZ might be adapted for use in Eco-innovation</p>
</b>
<p>By studying many more patents of innovative, environmentally designed
products it might be possible to extract some generic ‘principles’ or ‘operators’
for solving environmental contradictions. Because the environmental
contradictions are present on the systems level, these operators for
Eco-innovation will most likely support strategic </font><font SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000">environmental
product management. If carried out, this work might contribute to the
development of TRIZ in a non-technical context, as is currently investigated by
other authors (Mann, 2000).</p>
</font><font SIZE="3">
<p>From studying the ‘engineering parameters’ of the contradiction matrix
the authors would like to see the following three environmental issues covered
more explicitly: Health and environmental Risk (hazardous substances emitted to
air soil and water), Revalorization (waste not Eco-efficiently recycled) and
Resource Conservation (scarce or depleting resources used). These issues are
currently only blanket covered under the engineering parameter: ‘harmful-side
effects’</p>
</font><b>
<p>6. Conclusions</p>
</b><font SIZE="3">
<p>1. Existing TRIZ tools will be useful in Eco-innovation to solve technical or
physical contradictions.</p>
<p>2. The TRIZ principles of ‘ideality’ and ‘design without compromise’
fit well in the philosophy of sustainable design.</p>
<p>3. It may be possible to extract ‘principles’ or ‘operators’ for
solving environmental contradictions to support strategic </font><font SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000">environmental
product management.</p>
<p>4. It would be beneficial if TRIZ provided a whole life-cycle perpective of
the innovations it helps to create and covered more explicitally the
environmental issues of </font><font SIZE="3">hazardous substances, depleting
resources and waste-recycling.</p>
