<p>The reviewer’s responsibility is to help the reader decide whether or not
to spend valuable time, energy, and money on a new book. So if the reviewer says
“great book!” how does the reader know if she or he will agree with the
reviewer?</p>
<p>The reviewer, in this case, has been a TRIZ consultant and instructor for 5
years, editor of the TRIZ Journal for 4 of those years, and a physics professor,
aerospace engineer, and quality improvement consultant in the 15 years before
that. In the course of those careers, she has spent a lot of time with experts
in failure analysis, reliability, vulnerability and survivability, product
development, and with both beginners and experts in TRIZ.</p>
<p>Reviewer’s prediction: All those people will agree that <i>New Tools</i> is
a great book!</p>
<p>The first chapter introduces a variety of methods of failure analysis (HAZOP,
FMEA, etc.) and the methods of scenario construction used in each of them. The
scenario tree is demonstrated, and the differences in the use of the scenario
tree in each of the methods of analysis is explained. The explanations are easy
to read and extremely clear, without being over-simplified.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 introduces the concept of AFD-1 and AFD-2. The Anticipatory Failure
Determination (AFD) method was explained by Steve Ungvari in the October, 1999,
issue of the TRIZ Journal. Very basically, it is the application of TRIZ to a
failure situation.</p>
<p>In AFD-1, the purpose is to find out how the failure could have occurred. The
analyst asks, “how could I make this failure happen?”<font size="2"> </font>then
proceeds to use TRIZ to develop scientifically valid ways to cause the failure
to happen every time the situation occurs. After the analysis, experimental work
is conducted to validate the conclusion of the analysis. AFD-2 is the method of
looking for potential failures before they occur, and preventing them.</p>
<p>The case studies will be familiar to those who have heard Dr. Kaplan and Ms.
Zusman’s presentations at conferences. Whether they are familiar or not, the
reader will find them to be very well presented, with figures that enhance the
text, and diagrams that use the concepts that were introduced in the first two
chapters. They are examples that the readers can use as guides to their own
applications of AFD.</p>
<p>There are occasional references to the AFD software and databases published
by Ideation, but the book is very useful on its own. Appendices 1 and 2 have the
analysis templates for AFD-1 and -2, and Appendix 3 is a very complete case
study of the application of AFD-2 to the process of manufacturing a bicycle rear
fender. This case study is an excellent teaching aid, like the 2 that appear in
the body of the book.</p>
<p>The authors of <i>New Tools </i>are TRIZ experts and reliability experts.
They have succeeded in the difficult task of writing a book that can help
beginners learn the techniques of the experts, without overwhelming them. <i>New
Tools </i>is a valuable addition to the growing English language TRIZ
literature.</p>
