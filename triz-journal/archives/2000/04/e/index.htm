<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>This paper presents selected examples of authors’ experience in TRIZ
application to politics.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>In 1996 there was a President election campaign in one of the former Soviet
Republics. The team of TRIZ specialists had been involved in the campaign as a
Group of System Analysts and Decision-Making Support. The group dealt with
strategic and tactical concepts, short-term prediction, modeling agitation
supplies and solving all non-trivial problems, coming by (in management, in
technical sphere, or in communication).</p>
<p>At the first stage of the election campaign the group consulted 2
competitors. It was possible due to a two-stage election system. Parallel
consulting projects helped to apply TRIZ tools and methodologies more
effectively and to compare the results.</p>
<p>The first client (here - competitor A or simply A) was an experienced
politician and strong centrist leader. His goal was to win. The second client
(here - competitor B or simply B) was a new figure on the political arena. He
wished to present himself as well as his party as new political force. According
to pre-election surveys he could get the 6<sup>th </sup>place at the best.</p>
<p>As a result of the 1996 elections the competitor A became the president, the
competitor B got the third place and became a political sensation.</p>

<p>Here are several examples of TRIZ application to solving election problems.</p>
<b><u>
<p>Problem 1 &quot;The Poster&quot;</p>
</u></b>
<p>The team of the main opponent C (the former President) of our competitor A
issued a poster that had been pasted in many places. The poster included the
large portrait of C and political slogans. The portrait provided a great
impression: the competitor C looked like a real Father of the Nation - one of
the common people, but smart and wise. The poster was printed on a high quality
paper. The edition was very large - in order to paste these posters all over the
country. No other competitor (including A) had enough money to print so many
expensive posters. Our actions were vitally needed.</p>
<b>
<p>The contradiction:</p>
</b>
<p>The poster provided a big impression due to its overall high cost, but it
should make a bad impression because it is too expensive (an average citizen was
very poor).</p>
<b>
<p>Applied TRIZ-tool:</p>
<blockquote>
</b>
<p>Ideal Ultimate Result: the poster itself should make a bad impression.</p>
<p>Main Resource: lack of money.</p>
<p>TRIZ Operator “Counteracting the harmful effect” (fragment):</p>
<p>Neutralize the harmful effect with a countering effect [1,2].</p>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p>The Solution Concepts:</p>
</b>
<p>It was suggested:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To print a leaflet on poor inexpensive paper (it should look handmade or as
  if it was manufactured on a primitive printing machine) including:</p>
  <p>three short expressive phrases, describing terrible results of C's
  political activity during his presidency;</p>
  <p>three illustrations (simple drawings or photos) showing said phrases</p>
  <p>on the bottom of the paper, in the middle - one large word</p>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p align="CENTER">ENOUGH!</p>
</b>
<p align="CENTER">that should be seen from a far distance</p>
<sup><font size="2">
<p align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
</font></sup>
<blockquote>
  <p>A leaflet should be pasted near the C's poster (the best position - under
  the poster)</p>
  <p>A large edition is not required - if these leaflets would appear not in
  many places, people would discuss them more actively.</p>
  <p>The whole action (printing and pasting) should be done very quickly, until
  the impression of C's poster is still working.</p>
  <font size="5">
  </blockquote>
</font>
<p>The authors observed not only the implementation of their solution, but its
consequences as well. The most touching was a sample of the leaflet,
demonstrated to the authors by their neighbor as a real evidence of the voice of
people.</p>
<b><u>
<p>Problem 2 “What to do with too many VIPs?”</p>
</u></b>
<p>Too many VIPs had accumulated in the staff of the competitor A. Most of them
were bureaucrats of high rank with longstanding powerful connections. They
wished to play important role in making decisions for A with no responsibility
for the consequences of their suggestions, of course!</p>
<b>
<p>The contradiction:</p>
</b>
<p>Those people couldn't be avoided as they had some influence on the
electorate. However, their propositions were ridiculous and couldn't be
utilized.</p>
<b>
<p>Applied TRIZ-tool:</p>
<blockquote>
</b>
<p>The main Resource of the VIPs was the ability to create documents</p>
<p>The classical way of resolving the contradiction in space by insulating the
undesirable part within the system</p>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p>The Solution Concept:</p>
</b>
<p>It was suggested to organize the &quot;Political Council&quot; for all those
people as an element of the staff structure. Impressive title aimed to please a
sensitive ego. VIPs were asked to prepare their suggestions to the national
program of economic development. The &quot;Political Council&quot; was not
limited by time or by any other restriction. Suggestions, if provided, were
supposed to be selectively included into the program. VIPs were completely
stacked in their respectable activity, and therefore, did not hinder the work of
others.</p>
<b><u>
<p>Problem 3 “Too many VIPs again”</p>
</u></b>
<p>A similar situation to the problem 2 case had appeared in the camp of the
competitor B. This time however it were the meticulous party veterans. They were
very critical to a younger members of the staff (to all other members actually).
They thus provided an additional tension to the stressful environment of the
election campaign. On contrary to VIPs in the problem 2, most of those people
had no selfish ambitions, they were active and honest citizens willing to do
their best.</p>
<b>
<p>Applied TRIZ-tool:</p>
<blockquote>
</b>
<p>Main Resources of the particular group of people:</p>
<p>Honesty</p>
<p>Political activity</p>
<p>The Operator &quot;Redirecting the Effect at Another Object&quot;:</p>
<p>Focus the source of a negative effect on another object. That will protect
the object exposed to the effect before.</p>
<p>For this purpose, try the following:</p>
<p>put the source closer to the object</p>
<p>transport an effective part of the source to the object</p>
<p>turn the source in the required direction</p>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p>The Solution Concept:</p>
</b>
<p>The party veterans were assigned to “the critically important” task - to
be on duty at electoral districts in order of revealing all offenses against the
election law. This way everyone could be completely assured - the law would be
observed! Those responsible people would not forget and would never be late.
With their entire adherence to principles, they would check every voting paper
and every transporting ballot box.</p>
<p>In a post-communist country with young traditions of democracy the task was
really serious. Being not an ordinary procedure, but single party initiative, it
required time for preparations: creating, dissipating and learning prompt
instructions on how to identify offenses and legally deal with them.</p>
<b><u>
<p>Problem 4 “Undesired Meeting”</p>
</u></b>
<p>The staff of the competitor C, the main opponent of the competitor A, decided
to call a meeting of C supporters at the Square of National Agreement.</p>
<p>The Square of National Agreement is the Main Square of the country. In the
people's memories It is associated with the most important historical events, in
particular, with the announcement of Independence of the country. Therefore the
candidate who calls a meeting at this place makes a deep impression on the
people. It would look like as the whole Nation supports him. For that reason,
this action is undesirable for the competitor A.</p>
<p>The following information should also be taken into consideration while
solving the problem: to organize a meeting at the Square of National Agreement,
one should get the municipal permission. According to the information received,
C's application was sent in time to receive a permission. In addition, municipal
authorities were C’s supporters.</p>
<b>
<p>The contradiction:</p>
</b>
<p>A meeting had to be called, because it had been approved by the Municipality
and was perfectly organized. But it should not happen, as it could harmfully
impact the rating of the competitor A.</p>
<b>
<p>Applied TRIZ-tool:</p>
</b>
<p>Anticipatory Failure Determination method, part
4:&quot;Prevention/Elimination of the Failure&quot; [3].</p>
<b>
<p>The Solution concepts (fragments)</p>
</b>
<p>The resulting recommendations had been arranged into three main scenarios:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A. Preliminary measures</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">B. Direct measuresC. Measures of harmful effects reducing</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>A. Preliminary measures</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To put the following question at the session of Parliament: The Square of
  National Agreement is a National sacred place. Is it permissible to call there
  any partial meetings or actions for any politician’s support?</p>
  <p>To suggest and prove the resolution: any political actions on the Square,
  except All-National meetings, should be forbidden.</p>
  <p>Competitor A should announce the initiative to organize the United National
  meeting with all Competitors present (at the same place and at the same time
  or earlier). In this case, C couldn’t refuse to take part in it or to go to
  his own meeting.</p>
  <p>To leak the information about the preliminary measures discussed above and
  to prevent any actions in C's staff related to the meeting.</p>
  <font size="5">
  </blockquote>
</font>
<p><b>B. Direct Measures</b></p>
<p>If preliminary measures would be not effective, it was recommended:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To organize a meeting of retired, poor and disabled people at the same time
  near the Presidential Palace (C’s residency). To demand C's presence at the
  meeting as a politician, who was then responsible for the situation in the
  country.</p>
  <p>To invite independent reporters to C's meeting at the Square of National
  Agreement in order to get pictures and interviews.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>C. Measures of Reducing Harmful Consequences</b></p>
<p>In addition to direct measures it was recommended:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To publish in newspapers and to show on TV the reports from C's meeting. To
  attract electorate’s attention to the following:</p>
  <p>it was a meeting of C's supporters only</p>
  <p>not many people attended the meeting</p>
  <p>there were aggressive statements in speeches</p>
  <p>there were aggressive actions or intentions demonstrated by B's Supporters</p>
  <p>To show and to publish the reports from alternative meeting.</p>

<p><b>Discussion</b></p>
<p>Few selected examples of authors’ experience in TRIZ application to the
area of political consulting was presented.</p>
<p><b>Here are some conclusions:</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Our colleagues I. Kholkin, L. Novickova, V. Sibiriakov and others started
  using TRIZ for politics in early 90th. They collaborated with candidates into
  Parliament deputies, future mayors and governors. The consulting project
  provided by authors during election campaign 1996, was the first application
  of TRIZ to support top-level politicians - competitors for the country's
  presidency.</p>
  <p>Due to the systemic level of most TRIZ tools and methods (AFD, ARIZ,
  Operators, Separation Principles, Resources, etc.) TRIZ works in the political
  area as well and as effective as in industries. A slight &quot;iron&quot;
  touch does not bother anyone. On the contrary, it rejects psychological
  inertia and stimulates creativity.</p>
  <p>The distinctive feature of the election consulting is quick application of
  solutions and visibility of their results. The Solution providers can see how
  their recommendations were used and estimate their effectiveness in the real
  environment.</p>
  <p>Even when accepted recommendations are implemented partially, or in a most
  unsuitable way, the implementation would gain effective results, because TRIZ
  solutions are highly reliable and besides competitors don't have solutions
  like that.</p>
