<h1>Examples Of The Election Stratagems In Israel</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Sergey Faer elaborated and published 73 stratagems for
  election campaign (see his book “Methods of Election Campaign Strategy and
  Tactics” (St. Petersburg, 1998) - </font><u><font color="#0000ff">http://www.neva.spb.ru/faer/index_en.htm</font></u><font color="#000000">.
  One can see here the fine merge of TRIZ &amp; politics.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">In this article I present a few examples illustrating some
  of these stratagems in the recent politics of Israel.</p>

  </blockquote>
  </font></u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Suppose, you have some arguable issue: will the voters
support you in the elections? Or will the people support your supposed treaty
with a neighbor country?</p>
<i><u><font color="#000000">
<p align="JUSTIFY">Formula</font></u><font color="#000000">:</font></i><font color="#000000">
P</font>resent this arguable issue (e. g., the winning of the elections) as an
accomplished fact.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This stratagem may have several steps. One of them recommends
to discuss the details: i.e. instead of discussing if the result &quot;X&quot;
is possible at all - discussing the Y= F (X) and which one of the &quot;Y&quot;s
(Y1, Y2 or Y3) is better.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<i><u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Example</u></i>. Israel is now going to hold peace talks with
Syria. The planned proposal is to withdraw the Israeli forces from the Golan
Heights and to turn the Golan Heights over to Syria - all this in exchange for
the peace treaty. However, many of the Israeli people are opposing these plans.
The main reason is the safety consideration: the Golan Heights make a good
native obstacle to the possible Syrian invasion.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">So, up to this stratagem, the choice of “withdrawing or not
withdrawing” is skipped. In order to make the Israeli people get used to the
idea of withdrawing from the Golan Heights - the very idea of withdrawing is not
discussed. The supporters of this idea do not discuss if the Golan Heights
should be turned over to Syria.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Instead: the discussion is going on how to safeguard an
Israeli safely leaving the Golan Heights. Which security arrangements are
needed? How deep should be the demilitarized zones? What is the optimal depth of
the demilitarized zones? Which kind of early-warning capability is needed?
Should it be an early-warning station on the Hermon? Should it be satellite
photos? Should it be surveillance planes? And so on. (How to Safeguard a

<p align="JUSTIFY">A global and beautiful goal attracts people, does it not? And
such a &quot;makeweight&quot; to the Candidate’s earthed program may settle
the elections.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Important: this goal needs to be concrete, clear, and
understandable.</p>
<i><u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Formula</u>: </i>You should formulate and uphold the goals

<p>Example.</u></i></p>
<p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak vowed to bring Israel into line before the end of
the decade with the Maastricht Agreement. (MAASTRICHT TREATY is an international
agreement approved by the heads of government of the states of the European
Community (EC) in Maastricht, Neth., in December 1991. It was ratified by all EC
member states before Nov. 1, 1993, when it came into force. The treaty
established common standards for financial policy, criteria for inflation, debt,
deficit etc.)</p>
<p>So, Prime Minister Ehud Barak spoke at a conference in Herzliya on economic
policy. He vowed to bring Israel into line before the end of the decade with the
Maastricht standards for fiscal policy.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Within seven to eight years, Israel will adopt the
standards delineated in the Maastricht Agreement, in its deficit requirements,
inflation requirements, and to a degree in its debt requirements,&quot; Barak
told a conference.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&quot;I am convinced that the Israeli economy will be at the
forefront of developed world economies within seven to eight years,&quot; Barak
said.</p>

there is one candidate more running for election. He is an unmanifest partner of
our Candidate.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font><i><u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Example</u></i>. <font color="#000000">During the last (1999)
elections there were two main candidates for prime minister: Ehud Barak (the
leader of the “One Israel” block) and Benjamin (Bibi) Netaniyahu (the leader
of the Likud party). Still one more candidate was running at the beginning of
the race - the Center Party leader Yitzhak Mordechai. Obviously, he had poor
chances, still he vowed not to withdraw his candidacy. And suddenly…</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">One day before the elections, in a noon

<p align="JUSTIFY">Formula</font></u><font color="#000000">:</font></i><font color="#000000">
Convincing the voters, inclined in the rival’s favor, that their candidate
will remain in power even after losing the election, and his experience will be
used by our Candidate.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This stratagem appears to be fruitful especially when the
rival voters see that their candidate could not be elected. Then, while voting
in favor of our Candidate, they would support their candidate as well.</p>
</font><u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Example.</i></u> Although the final night of the election
broadcasts offered no last-minute bombshells, Ehud Barak debuted two new ads
clearly aimed at wrapping up the election tomorrow by speaking to those
still-undecided voters in the middle.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A few months before, Barak started this election campaign
with the pledge to cut the funding for the religious education and new
settlements over the Green Line (i. e. in the territories occupied in 1967).
This gave him support from the vast amount of the voters, new immigrants
especially.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">And now, at the last night, he allowed himself to change the
line.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Speaking directly to the camera, the One Israel leader
cushioned his party's line that funding for orthodox religious education and new
settlements will be redirected elsewhere, by declaring he still respects the
religious values and &quot;living over the Green Line.” In his final
appearance, Barak gave what sounded more like an acceptance speech, pledging to
work together in a new government even with those &quot;whose viewpoints are
different than mine.&quot; (Barak's final appeal trumps Bibi / by CALEV

<p align="JUSTIFY">Method 58</p>
</font></u><font color="#000000">
<p align="JUSTIFY">CLASHING THE INTERESTS</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">“The best defense is attack.” The best attack is
returning to your rival his own blow. And when you have more than one rival, a
blow of one rival may be returned to another one. The more the number of your
rivals - the more the number of possible combinations. Is it some kind of a
sophistry? No, it is a necessity.</p>
<i><u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Formula</u>: </i>Clashing the attacker’s interests with
those of the other rivals.</p>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<p align="RIGHT">&nbsp;</p>
</font><i><u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Example.</u></i> “Shas” is the name of one of the
parties. Its leader at the time of the last (1999) elections was Arye Deri (he
resigned soon afterwards being convicted in bribery). At the time before the
elections he was under trial and making an effort to prove his innocence by
attacking the trial, all the judicial system, the Supreme Court and its
president Aharon Barak (claiming that the judicial system in Israel was
prosecuting him because of his eastern - Moroccan - origin).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">From the other hand, Shas and Arye Deri were attacked by the
Shinuy party and its leader Tommy Lapid. The background for the Lapid’s attack
was the very fact of Deri’s conviction: “How could the political party,
running to the Knesset, be headed by a criminal?”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">So, up to the Method “Clashing the Interests” Aryeh Deri
tried to make the Supreme Court and Tommy Lapid clash with each other. He found
a citation from the book by Tommy Lapid “I’m Still Talking”: &quot;More
than once it has been said that we are suffering from law by force and the
dictator for better or for worse is [Supreme Court President] Aharon Barak.&quot;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Deri’s using this source - Shinuy leader Tommy Lapid - to
back him up was quite unexpected. Deri told his supporters there is no reason to
fear he will be investigated by the police and jailed for this criticism of the
judiciary, because it is Lapid who voiced it. (Deri cites Lapid in attack on
courts / By LIAT COLLINS)</p>
