<h1>TRIZCON2000: Conference Report</h1>
Ellen Domb and Michael Slocum<br>
</p>
<p>Monday, May 1</p>
<p>More than 100 people from the US, Canada, the UK, Japan, Korea, Brazil,
Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Mexico, Austria, France and Germany gathered in New
Hampshire this week for TRIZCON2000, the second conference of the Altshuller
Institute for TRIZ Studies. The TRIZ Journal was a sponsor of the conference,
among a distinguished group that included the Ford Motor Company, Invention
Machine Corporation, Ideation International, Focus New Hampshire Institute, the
Technical Innovation Center, Responsible Management, DEKA Research and
Development, Aerovironment, the Christa McAuliffe Planetarium, and the Inventors
Digest. Editors Ellen Domb and Michael Slocum had the opportunity to put on
their other “hats” as TRIZ consultants and TRIZ researchers and present
papers and participate in the learning at the conference.</p>
<p>Larry Smith, Acting President of the Altshuller Institute, opened the
conference with a message from the International TRIZ Society congratulating the
Altshuller Institute. Larry, Richard Langevin and Steven Rodman gave us personal
and professional tributes to Lev Shulyak, founder of the Altshuller Institute,
who passed away this year. Lev’s work to bring TRIZ to the US, and Lev’s
vision in creating the Altshuller Institute were brought alive for the
conference participants.</p>
<p>Conference chairman Jim Boynton welcomed the press-reporters from the New
York Times, Boston Globe, Worcester Business Journal, The Nashua Sun, OEM
Magazine, New Hampshire Magazine, and Nikkei Publications, WMUR TV, NPR radio of
Worcester and NH were present, and actively participated in the conference.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker, Paul MacCready, is a world-renowned engineer and
inventor, perhaps best known as the “Father of Human-powered Flight.”
MacCready spoke at the McAuliffe Museum and the Boston Museum of Science under
the AI sponsorship on Saturday, was a student in the tutorial session on Sunday,
then gave the keynote address on Monday morning, and the dinner speech Monday
night! He told reporters “If I knew then what I know now about TRIZ, I could
have built the Gossamer Condor in 6 months instead of 18 months!” His video,
“Doing more with less” built on the theme that as the world population
increases, it will be necessary to do much more with fewer resources, and his
talk illustrated that if you focus on goals of super-efficiency, uninhibited
initially by practical constraints, in a very few years you can do very
practical, commercially useful developments. The human powered flights were
pioneering developments of light weight and efficient power technologies, that
have led to solar-powered aircraft, and automobiles, a 2 ounce surveillance
aircraft, a 65,000 ft. aircraft that will remain aloft for 100 days at a time
for research and communications, and vans and buses that can drive 300 miles/day
on 10 minutes of charging. The one gram flying ornithopter was demonstrated at
dinner, and Dr. MacCready used it to show how the seemingly impractical work is
necessary to start the work that becomes the technology of the future. He
integrated his knowledge of thinking skills and how the brain works into his
knowledge of technology development and his concern for the absence of teaching
these skills in the schools.</p>
<p>His goal is “The world should be desirable and sustainable when my kids
reach my age.”<font size="2"> </font>The apparent impossibility does not
discourage him: MacCready emphasized that Altshuller’s work with children
matches his own attempts to find out how to “liberate” young minds from the
constraints of school so that they can solve the problems of the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Doug Field, Chief Engineer at DEKA Research and Development, gave the
keynote presentation. The INDEPENDENCE 3000 IBOT Transporter (figure 1, standard
function, <u><font color="#0000ff">&lt;http://www.indetech.com/&gt;</font></u>)
was showcased during the lecture as an example of what can be accomplished by
focused creative effort.</p>

<p>Dr. Domb presented her paper on TRIZ in the Six Sigma Company. Dr. Slocum
presented on the work he and Dr. Tim Clapp have conducted at North Carolina
State University. There where approximately 30 technical presentations during
the two days of the general conference. During the balance of the year the TRIZ
Journal will be reprinting papers from the conference proceedings. The media
extensively interviewed Drs. Slocum and Clapp during the conference and it will
be interesting to see what publicity TRIZ will receive due to this. The media
seemed to be very excited about what they saw and heard.</p>
