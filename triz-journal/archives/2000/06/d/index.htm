<p>Summary: two years ago, a European transnational research project, found that
treating&nbsp; beechwood against funghi&nbsp; in an axial way could save lots of
toxic wastes and also boost productivity. Should the researchers knew about
Altshuller TRIZ methodology, perhaps they could save lots of efforts in arriving
to the same conclusions.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key relevant problems (i.e. inventive problems) solved by removing
contradictions is one of the most surprising yet brightest discoveries of
Altshuller. Further work of him and peers, yielded to an abstraction process,
aimed at extrapolating the solution of many problems to every inventive problem.
<p>By analyzing the patents that unveiled major technological advances,
Altshuller noticed&nbsp; that each problem, at the end posed two mutually
contradictory requirements.
<p>When trying to solve problems, in contrast, many firms face different levels
of difficulty. Normally a problem arises when with the either known or existing
elements and resources it is not possible to satisfy a function. Depending on
wether the former are known or unknown, we could present the following table:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;
<table border="1" cols="3" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td><font color="#990000">For the problem solver</font></td>
    <td><font color="#3333FF">Existing knowledge</font></td>
    <td><font color="#3333FF">Not yet existing (1)</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><font color="#990000">Known knowledge</font></td>
    <td>Designer’s problems&nbsp;</td>
    <td><center>--</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><font color="#990000">Unknown knowledge</font></td>
    <td>Information problems</td>
    <td>Research or Inventive problems</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font size="-2">(1) Not yet existing knowledge&nbsp; could be either&nbsp;
existing science or technology not yet applied to this sort of problems, or
really new to unveil science or technology.</font><br>
&nbsp;
<p>Altshuller identified those problems which do not pose any contradiction, and
the necessary knowledge is known, as ‘designer’s problems’ When the
existing knowledge of further elements or resources is not known for the solver,
then we face an ‘information problem'. The late are common among small firms,
specially operating in mature or not technological intensive sectors.
<p>Note that Altshuller’s levels 3 and higher fall in the research or
inventive problems. Many of the patents whose solutions&nbsp; could overcome
contradictions by satisfying both contradictory requirements, were classified
and grouped into these levels. It was a fundamental advance made by Altshuller,
to concentrate in extracting the knowledge of the higher level patents and give
hints for the solution of truly inventive difficult problems.
<p>The result of such a huge work of classification, abstraction and inference,
the contradictions matrix is really a wonderful example of knowledge management
presented in a brilliant yet simple way for every TRIZ practitioner. However,
many people has still to discover&nbsp; that simple do not means ineffective. As
Einstein said, ”things should be made as simple as possible&nbsp; but not
simpler”
<p>Take for instance a research project, aimed at recovering the use of European
beechwood and by more environmentally friendly methods, instead of using
tropical hardwoods which now dominate the European market. Beechwood is a good
hard wood, but unfortunately it is dimensionally unstable and it is also
vulnerable to fungal attack. To make it useable for manufactures goods,
beech-wood must be stabilised so that it does not crack or deform during the
drying process. The wood must also be made resistant to fungal rot, which would
otherwise destroy any wood that comes into contact with soil. This last property
is increasingly demanded since many outdoor children parks are being constructed
from wood.
<p>Until now, the methods for treating beechwood have been using an autoclave
where the logs are impregnated in the radial dimension. However, this methods
has many drawbacks and do not solve the problems commented above. After a
difficult and lasting treatment, the fungicide only penetrates a depth of one
inch, making it vulnerable for using it outdoor. Attempts to increase the axial
penetration, by a longer treatment caused problems in the wood itself.
<p>Under a European transnational research project, a team of firms, and
technical centers have been pursuing to overcome all these problems trying
tacitly to achieve an ideal system: a method that treats the wood rapidly and
with a very deep penetration, without using toxic agents. At this point any TRIZ
practitioner could had help to point the best direction for finding a solution:
‘the ideal final result would be something like : the beechwood treats with
fungicide by itself, with a very deep penetration, without using toxic agents.
<p>After not few efforts and time of research and problem solving, the team of
the project found the solution almost by luck, with the rediscovery of a patent
registered in 1838 by a man named Boucherie. The patent told about a method for
fast treatment of wood. He discovered that a freshly-felled tree could easily be
impregnated with a fungicide or other treatment. The action of the tree's
circulatory system, which has up to 10 000 capillaries per square centimeter of
wood, pushes the fungicide up the trunk at a rate of one meter per hour,
regardless of the size of the tree. This axial impregnation process compares
favorably with the one using radial impregnation. Citing the article published
in Europe “the project was sparked off by the rediscovery of an ancient patent”
(5)<br>
&nbsp;
<p>At this point, let us use the work done by Altshuller and peers by applying a
simple matrix of names and numbers to a seemingly complex problem like the
treatment of wood, and see if applying TRIZ we can save the trial and error
process and to give a straight direction for finding a solution.
<p>If we take one of the problems faced: by increasing the time of treatment for
increasing its depth of penetration, a harmful effects appear to the wood, we
can use:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;
<blockquote>
  <b>parameter to improve</b> : duration of action on a stationary object<br>
  <b>parameter that gets worst: </b>object affected harmful factors
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  &nbsp; from the contradictions matrix an inventive principle suggests: <b>dimensionality
  change .</b>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
further explanations to this principle given for instance by Invention Machine’s
TechOptimizer say:
<blockquote>
  <font color="#000099">- move an object in two- or three-dimensional space,</font><br>
  <font color="#000099">- use a multi-story arrangement of objects instead of a
  single-story arrangement,</font><br>
  <font color="#000099">- tilt or re-orient the object, put it on its side,</font><br>
  <font color="#000099">- use a different side of the given area.</font><br>
  &nbsp;
</blockquote>
During TRIZ seminars, whenever I ask participants to suggest a solution for
solving this ‘wood contradiction’, without knowing any existing solution,
they always propose to treat the log by its axial side.<br>
Although not solving a complex problem, TRIZ&nbsp; gives the right direction for
solving it. Should the research team did not find that ancient patent, probably
the number of trials and errors had increased. With the use of the contradiction
matrix, the path to the solution can be shortened.
<p>Of course, in the path to achieve the final result, more opportunities for
applying TRIZ techniques would surely help a lot. Returning to the actual
project, the research team developed a non toxic treatment&nbsp; by replacing
the toxic chromium salts used before with a new treatment based on copper
sulfate, which is environmentally relatively harmless and which produces glucose
as a&nbsp; waste product.

<p>As conclusion we can see another time that TRIZ is an excellent structured
method and way of thinking for increasing our technical creativity. ¡simple but
not simpler!&nbsp; What took the European Commission several years of research
can be done by TRIZ students in their first class.</p>
