<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">The “76 Standard
Solutions” of TRIZ were compiled by G.S. Altshuller and his associates between
1975 and1985.&nbsp; They are grouped into 5 large categories or classes as

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">(References 1-5)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">This series of articles
began in the February 2000, issue of the TRIZ Journal, with a tutorial article
and the Class 1 problems and solutions.&nbsp; Class 2 appeared in the March,
2000, TRIZ Journal, and Class 3 appeared in May.&nbsp; Class 3 is used if
Classes 1, 2 or 4 were not quite adequate.&nbsp; By raising the problem to the
super-system or looking at micro-level changes new opportunities are
created.&nbsp; The references are all in the Class 1 article.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Typically, the 76 standard
solutions are used as a step in ARIZ, after the Su-field model has been
developed and any constraints on the solution have been identified.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The model and the constraints are used to identify the class and the specific
solution.&nbsp; It is useful to view the Su-field model as the zone of interest
as used in ARIZ.&nbsp; As in other TRIZ instructional material, examples are
used to show the application of the standard solution to a wide variety of
problems from many fields.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Class 4.</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">&nbsp;
Detecting and Measuring.&nbsp; Detection and measurement are typically for
control. Detection is binary (something either happens or doesn’t happen) and
measurement has some level of quantification and precision.&nbsp; For example, a
length measurement might be 3.24m +/-.02m.&nbsp;&nbsp; In many cases the most
innovative solution is automatic control without detection/measurement by taking
advantage of physical, chemical, or geometrical effects.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.1. Indirect
Methods&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.1.1. Modify the system
instead of detecting or measuring so there is no longer a need for
measurement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Examples:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Music
boxes incorporate a spinning governor whose speed is limited by air resistance
to control the speed of the rotor and timing of the tune.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is no need to measure the speed, since the governor automatically adjusts
to the right speed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Gas
transfer systems are sometimes required to deliver precisely metered
amounts.&nbsp; Rather than measuring the amount, a critical orifice may be
incorporated which limits flow to an acceptable maximum regardless of driving
pressure.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Self
regulation of heating systems is possible by using a switch activated by a</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">thermocouple
or a bimetallic strip.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Colors
in gel coats on fiberglass boats, and in master patterns for molds:&nbsp;
Coloring agents are added to the sucessive coats of paint, so that as the finish
is sanded to refine the shape of the object, the various layers are readily
visible and serve to prevent the localized removal of excess material without
the need for a mechanical measurement.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.1.2. Measure a copy or an
image, if 4.1.1 can’t be used.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Examples:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">A
comparator is a device to magnify and precisely measure the projected image
(shadow) of items normally difficult to measure such as soft products, or item
with very irregular surfaces.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2">Populations of military personnel and equipment, and
populations of waterfowl (geese and/or ducks) are measured by counting from
magnified aerial or satellite photographs.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2">To determine the minimum but sufficient amount of
fertilizer to be applied in each specific location of a farm field, satellite
scanned images of the crop’s growth patterns are used as a control reference.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.1.3. Use 2 detections
instead of continuous measurement, if 4.1.1 or 4.1.2 cannot be used.&nbsp;&nbsp;
For example, make a ring having the outer tolerance limits of a machined part,
and a solid having its diameter equal to the inner tolerance limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The part is the right diameter when it fits through the ring (one detection) and
the solid fits through it (second detection.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Examples:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">The
true diameter of a flexible object must sometimes be known and matched for
purposes of assembly.&nbsp; The minimum axis and maximum axis dimensions can be
consecutively detected (without distorting the object) and used to calculate the
true diameter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Dyed
or printed items may be required to match established color standards under a
variety of ambient light conditions.&nbsp; Consecutive comparisons of the test
item to the standard under two or more light sources of known frequency is a
common way to assure the best overall match.&nbsp; These simple detections are
far easier for someone who is not expert in color matching.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.2. Create or synthesize a
measurement system.&nbsp; Some elements or fields must be added to the existing
system</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">&nbsp;4.2.1. If an
incomplete Su-field system cannot be detected or measured, a single or double
Su-field system with a field as an output is created.&nbsp; If the existing
field is inadequate, change or enhance the field without interfering with the
original system.&nbsp; The new or enhanced field should have an easily
detectable parameter that correlates to the parameter we need to know.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Examples:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">The
presence and size of very small holes in plastic items may be difficult to
detect.&nbsp; If the item is filled with air and sealed, it may then be immersed
in a liquid bath under a reduced pressure (vacuum).&nbsp; The presence of air
bubbles in the liquid can reveal the existence and size of leaks.</span></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="01.gif" width="564" height="290"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Where
S1 is item air leak, S2 is test liquidS2’ is bubble, F1 is reduced pressure
and F2 is visual field of light reflecting&nbsp; presence of air bubbles
indicating leak.&nbsp; S1 is an incomplete Su-field.&nbsp; Both S2 and F1
(liquid and pressure difference) have to be added to make a complete system,
then F2 has to be added to enhance the performance of the
system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Plastic
food storage bags are now produced with a “zipper” type seal.&nbsp; Food is
placed inside and the air is expelled before sealing the “zipper”.&nbsp; It
is difficult to know if the zipper is closed, since there is little air left
inside upon which pressure could be exerted.&nbsp; If the “zipper” sections
are produced of two different colors,(e.g. blue and yellow) they will combine to
produce a different (e.g. green) color (optical field) when properly mated.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Thoracic
sounds (heart and respiratory sounds) do not have a volume and level of
resolution adequate for diagnosis if heard with only the human ear.&nbsp; A
stethoscope produces an amplified mechanical field (acoustic pressure waves)
which can easily be detected by the human ear.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.2.2. Measure an
introduced additive.&nbsp; Introduce an additive, that reacts to a change in the
original system, then measure the changes in the additive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Examples:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Biological
Samples (Cells, bacteria, animal or plant tissue) can be examined under a
microscopic, but details are difficult to distinguish and measure.&nbsp; Adding
a chemical staining agent to the specimen allows its structural detail to be
seen and measured.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in" align="center"><img border="0" src="02.gif" width="563" height="338"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Where
S1 is specimen, S2 is microscope, F1 is light, F2 is light out, S3 is stain, F2‘
is&nbsp; augmented light out of microscope.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Barium
is introduced into the intestine before an x-ray exam.&nbsp; The barium coats
the interior surface, then the x-rays measure the density and position of the
barium.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Radioactive
iodine is concentrated in the thyroid, then measurements of locally emitted
radiation show how well or poorly the thyroid is processing the iodine, thus
indicating the state of the thyroid.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Subtle
changes in the shape of aircraft and automobile surfaces can have a significant
effect on the aerodynamic drag and hence performance.&nbsp; If it is desired to
observe and measure these effects, smoke can be introduced into a wind tunnel
where the object is being tested.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.2.3. If nothing can be
added to the system, then detect or measure the system’s effect on a field
created by additive(s) placed in the external environment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Example:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in" align="center"><img border="0" src="03.gif" width="564" height="320"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">A
person wishes to know her exact location even when remote from any landmarks,
roads or signposts.&nbsp; The Global Positioning System of satellites provides
continuous signals (the field) covering the entire surface of the
earth..&nbsp;&nbsp; The person can detect both absolute position and change in
position (velocity) using a simple, hand-held, GPS receiver.&nbsp; She is
measuring her position relative to the satellites (additives, when viewed from
the point of view of the earth) in order to determine her position on earth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Where
S1 is the position, S2 is the person, F1 is information, F2 are distances to at
least three satellites</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.2.4.
If additives cannot be introduced into the environment of the system as in
4.2.3, then create them by decomposing or changing the state of something that
is already in the environment, and measure the effect of the system on these
created additives.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Examples:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Bubble
/ cloud chambers can be used to study the properties of sub-atomic particles
resulting from bombardment collisions:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">In
bubble chambers liquid hydrogen&nbsp; is kept just below the boiling point of
temperature and pressure.&nbsp; Energetic particles passing through cause local
boiling, forming a path of bubbles that are photographed to study the particle
dynamics.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">In
cloud chambers a saturated alcohol vapor is maintained in a chamber.&nbsp; When
particles pass through, they ionize the vapor, forming a string of nucleation
sites where droplets condense.&nbsp; The droplets are photographed to visualize
the path of the particles.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.3. Enhancing the
measurement system</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.3.1. Apply natural
phenomena.&nbsp; Use scientific effects that are known to occur in the system,
and determine the state of the system by observing changes in the effects.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Examples:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2">The temperature of conductive liquid can be determined
from changes in electrical conductivity.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2">The Hall effect (the voltage across a semiconductor
depends on a magnetic field vertical to it) is used to measure and provide
control for the speed of precision variable speed electric motors.&nbsp; The
Hall emf is the potential difference created by a magnetic field across a plate
carrying electric current.&nbsp; Devices used to measurement force, tension,
power of an electric current, and harmonic analyzers us the Hall effect.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Mass
spectroscopy is achieved by controlling the magnetic fields through which
particles are accelerated.&nbsp; The path of the particle also depends on its
ionization state.&nbsp; These allow measurement of the test particle’s mass by
calculation from the trajectory.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.3.2. If changes in a
system cannot be determined directly or by passing a field, measure the excited
resonant frequency of the system or an element in order to measure changes..</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Examples:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Finite
Element Analysis:&nbsp; Usually done by simulation.&nbsp; A range of frequencies
of mechanical force is applied to the object at a variety of locations.&nbsp;
The stresses created are calculated at many locations throughout the object to
evaluate the need for design changes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Tuning
a piano&nbsp; with a tuning fork, that excites the strings and the entire system
and allows the appropriate frequency to be matched by adjusting tension.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.3.3. If 4.3.2 is not
possible, measure the resonant frequency of the object joined to another of
known properties.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Examples:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Instead
of directly measuring capacitance, insert the object of unknown capacitance into
a circuit of known inductance, then vary the frequency of the applied voltage to
find the resonant frequency of the combined circuit, then calculate the
capacitance of the added object.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.4. </span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Measure
Fe-field:&nbsp; The introduction of ferromagnetic materials for
measurement&nbsp; was popular before the development of remote sensing,
miniature devices, fiber optics, microprocessors, etc.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.4.1. Add or make use of a
ferromagnetic substance and a magnetic field in a system (by means of permanent
magnets or loops of electric current) to facilitate measurement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Examples</span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Traffic
control is routinely accomplished with traffic lights to stop vehicles.&nbsp; If
it is desired to know when a vehicle is waiting to proceed, or to know how long
a queue of vehicles stretches, conductors in loops buried under the pavement in
key locations can easily detect vehicles (containing ferromagnetic components).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.4.2. Add magnetic
particles to a system or change a substance to ferromagnetic particles to
facilitate measurement by detection of the resulting magnetic field.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Example:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Ferromagnetic
particles are incorporated into certain inks used on currency to aid
verification of authenticity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.4.3. If ferromagnetic
particles cannot be added directly to the system or a substance cannot be
replaced with ferromagnetic particles, construct a complex system, by putting
ferromagnetic additives into the substance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">A classical Soviet
example of this method is:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Liquid
acting under pressure brings about hydro-explosions of rock layers.&nbsp; For
controlling the liquid, ferro-magnetic powder is introduced into it.&nbsp; (S U
Author’s Certificate # 754347).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.4.4. Add ferromagnetic
particles to the environment, if they cannot be added to the system.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">A classical Soviet
example of this method is:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Waves
arise when moving a model of a ship through&nbsp; the water.&nbsp; In order to
study the characteristics of wave formation, ferro-magnetic particles are added
to the water.<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.4.5. Measure the effects
of natural phenomena associated with magnetism such as the Curie point,
hysteresis, quenching of superconductivity, the Hall effect, etc.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Example:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
See 2.4.7 for Magnetic Resonance Imaging example</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.5.
Direction of Evolution of the Measuring Systems</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.5.1. Transition to bi-
and poly-systems. If a single measurement system does not give sufficient
accuracy, use two or more measuring systems, or make multiple measurements.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Example:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">To
measure vision, the optometrist uses a series of instruments to measure overall
ability to focus at a distance, ability to focus close up, and consistency of
focus across the entire retina compared to focus just at the center.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">4.5.2. Instead of a direct
measurement of a phenomenon, measure the first and second derivatives in time or
in space.&nbsp; For example, measure velocity and acceleration instead of
measuring position.&nbsp; Measure the rate of frequency change of a sound
(Doppler shift) to determine the velocity of the source.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Examples:</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Ground-based
radar systems for aircraft position and velocity measurement use both direct
radar reflection and changes in the radar frequency (measures position,
velocity, and acceleration) to calculate an accurate position and velocity for
each aircraft.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">The
“Red Shift” of light from retreating galaxies is used in estimates of
acceleration and thus of distance.</span></p>
