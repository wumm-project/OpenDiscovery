color:black;layout-grid-mode:line">The Collaborative Innovation (CI) process has
been developed at United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) as an integrated
collection of best-practice design methods (including TRIZ), enhanced and
simplified to support Integrated Product Development (IPD) teams during <u>conceptual
design</u>.&nbsp; Over the past 3 years, CI has been applied to a wide range of
UTC innovation efforts, from cost-reduction of mature products to clean-sheet
design of new types of products &amp; processes.&nbsp; The CI process enables an
IPD team to: a) focus their innovation efforts on opportunities that have the
greatest potential of adding stakeholder value, b) use stakeholder value to
guide concept evaluation and selection, and c) create a development plan that
will reduce risk as quickly as possible.</span></font></p>

color:black;layout-grid-mode:line">CI is focused on conceptual design because it
has long been clear that at least 70% of the cost, reliability, performance,
safety, etc. of products are set during conceptual design.&nbsp; Conceptual
design is the highest-leverage opportunity for innovation.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" color="black" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;

and its related processes.&nbsp; Conceptual design teams need to know where to <u>focus</u>
their innovation efforts, strategically, to add the most value.&nbsp; Innovation
for innovation's sake alone is not valuable.</span></font></p>

line">Unlike detailed design, conceptual design lacks detailed prototypes that
can be &quot;test-driven&quot; by representative customers or subjected to
instrumented testing.&nbsp; During conceptual design, teams typically consider
between 10-100 rough-hewn concepts.&nbsp; It is impractical to either confront
representative customers with, or test models of all of these concepts.&nbsp;
Instead, the team needs a &quot;value-based gauge&quot; that it can use to
evaluate and select concepts based on their potential to add <u>stakeholder
value</u>.</span></font></p>

</span></font></span></font><font size="2" color="black"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black;layout-grid-mode:
line">Once concepts have been selected, value can only be added if they are
pursued; action is required.&nbsp; A pre-requisite to action is a development
plan and a clear business case to proceed.&nbsp; There is risk inherent in
product development, so decisions are made under conditions of uncertainty and
the result is rework.&nbsp; Time and cost for rework can be substantially
reduced by development plans that reduce risk as quickly as possible, so that
decisions are made under conditions of greater certainty.&nbsp; Conceptual
design teams need methods to create development plans that <u>reduce risk</u> as
early as possible in the development cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" color="black" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
color:black;layout-grid-mode:line">Detailed design involves optimization and
determining precise values of design parameters; conceptual design involves
consideration of alternative product and process architectures and technological
approaches.&nbsp; While bounding ranges for numerical design parameters may be
assumed, specific numerical values are as yet unknown.&nbsp; Consequently,
conceptual design teams demand <u>quick, simple methods</u>, that are faster and
less complex than detailed analyses and detailed requirements definition.&nbsp;
They are unwilling to commit the time and effort required to apply detailed
methods, since their information is in such rough form.&nbsp; For this reason,
many methods that are best practices during detailed design must be simplified
for concept design without losing their kernel of effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" color="black" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
color:black;layout-grid-mode:line">Integrated Product Development (IPD) core
teams are ideally composed of and supported by individuals having radically
different backgrounds and areas of expertise.&nbsp; It is this diversity that
brings a variety of perspectives to conceptual design and increases the
likelihood that multiple design alternatives will be generated and evaluated and
that life-cycle issues will be considered systemically, rather than as
afterthoughts and engineering changes.&nbsp; But many of these diverse
individuals are not experts on all facets of the existing product and its
related life-cycle processes.&nbsp; They must be provided with appropriate
documentation to enable them to understand and contribute to the conceptual
design discussion.&nbsp; Available product and process documents are typically
suitable for detailed design, involving considerable implementation detail that
obscures the fundamental architecture of the product and related
processes.&nbsp; Very often, the detailed design documents do not even address
the primary conceptual design issues.&nbsp; Conceptual design teams need <u>product/process
architectural documentation</u>, without the distraction of detailed-design
issues.</span></font></p>

developed and used to support conceptual design teams within UTC's Business
Units, including Pratt &amp; Whitney (jet engines), Otis Elevator (elevator
systems), and International Fuel Cells (power-generation systems).&nbsp; These
teams' missions ranged from innovative conceptual redesigns for cost reduction
of mature products to radically innovative designs of new types of products.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" color="black" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;

the members of IPD teams, and those who support them, to rapidly engage and
contribute, so that they readily add value through the diversity of their
backgrounds and skills.&nbsp; CI accomplishes this by <u>modeling the functional
architecture</u> of a product and its associated processes so that this
information is <u>accessible</u> to the core team and those who support it.</span></font></p>

team's assumptions and decisions so that others in the organization can consider
them and add value by identifying necessary adjustments and/or by embracing them
based on clear understanding.&nbsp; This is accomplished openly, during frequent
reviews, and privately, as individuals draw their own conclusions by examining
explicit team documentation.</span></font></p>

have a good idea of its value.&nbsp; They could readily determine the value of

characteristics of the product or process being designed and of related
life-cycle processes is created.&nbsp; Each characteristic is believed to be
important toward satisfying stakeholder needs and must be able to be assessed
for proposed concepts before they have been implemented.&nbsp; The
characteristics should be as independent of one another as possible, to avoid
double counting. A weighted average of the stakeholder-need weights and the
importance weights for the characteristics results in an overall rating of the
importance of each characteristic toward providing value.&nbsp; This set of key
characteristics, together with their relative weights, is the &quot;Value-Based
Gauge&quot; that is later used to evaluate and select concepts.</span></font></p>

2: Innovation Focus</span></font></b></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">History
has shown the disadvantages of focusing innovation where it is technically
easiest or where it is most “interesting” or technically challenging.&nbsp;
Products and processes that have resulted from such misguided innovation have
not generally been successful unless they also happened to add sufficient value.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Focusing
innovation based on the actions of market leaders is disadvantageous because
only the effect of their design efforts is visible, e.g., the results of their
intellectual property (IP) strategy and their first preliminary product
offerings.&nbsp; The IP strategy and product and process knowledge that produced
these artifacts is not only hidden, but typically one design-cycle old.&nbsp;
Focusing solely on these artifacts is likely to perpetuate a market-following
position.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">A
healthier strategy is to evaluate the design space, quickly assessing each area
to determine</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">its
potential value, its value with current technology in the current marketplace,
and the technology hurdles and market factors that must be overcome to yield its
potential.&nbsp; This allows a design team to drill down in areas of the design
space that present the most valuable innovation opportunities while
understanding and managing the risk that competitors might pursue other
areas.&nbsp; This strategy limits competitive risk and enables the business to
react with agility when new technologies or market changes present
opportunities.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Functional
modeling is a well-known method of understanding which system elements perform
which useful and harmful functions.&nbsp; It is a common element in TRIZ
analysis, although it takes different forms with different authors.&nbsp;
Figures 7 illustrates Functional Modeling (FM) as it is used within CI.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">The
notation for functional modeling involves blue circles representing elements of
the system being designed, green circles representing elements of the &quot;outersystem&quot;
(i.e., elements outside the system being designed), and yellow circles
representing the stakeholders: outersystem elements that are the primary
beneficiaries of the system being designed.&nbsp; (Note that for sub-systems,
the stakeholders in a functional model are typically other sub-systems, as
opposed to the human stakeholders considered in Value Modeling.)&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">The
functions are represented as arrows between elements.&nbsp; Useful functions are
shown in blue and harmful functions in red.&nbsp; A function between two
elements indicates that the origin element performs the function and
consequently changes or limits an attribute of the destination element.&nbsp;
This is analogous to the information in OAF tables, in Ford's USIT methodology [Sickafus
97], except that USIT acknowledges not only one, but two origin elements causing
the function (as does the theory of Triads [Kowalick 98]).&nbsp; USIT also
explicitly models the attributes of the two origin objects that cause the
function to occur, as well as the attribute of the destination object.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Value
analysis is the part of CI's innovation focus step that actually identifies
where to focus to add value.&nbsp; Value engineering defines the Value of a
design as its Functionality (its benefits) divided by its Problems and its Costs
[Miles 61].&nbsp; Figure 10 illustrates how Value Analysis is performed in
CI.&nbsp; Functionality is plotted against the sum of Problems and Cost.&nbsp;
Functionality includes contribution to <b><font color="blue"><span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">PUFs</span></font></b>,
but does NOT include mitigating <font color="blue"><span style="color:blue">UFs</span></font>.&nbsp;
An ideal system element (shown in green) would provide excellent functionality
with no problems or costs, while a worthless and harmful system element (shown
in red) would provide no functionality but cause significant problems at high
cost.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">The
system elements from the Functional Model are graphed based on their
functionality, problems and cost.&nbsp; The diagonal lines are lines of constant
value.&nbsp; The horizontal line indicates no value, the 22-degree line
represents more value, the 39-degree line represents even more value, etc.&nbsp;
So on this graph, element A is of extremely low value, while element B is of
extremely high value.&nbsp; Note that cost-reduction teams are purely focused on
moving the elements to the left on the VA graph (or eliminating them).&nbsp;
Radical Product-Innovation Teams (clean-sheet designs and radical derivatives)
are concerned primarily with moving the elements upward on the VA graph, adding
substantial new functionality to them (in some cases, by satisfying previously
unknown stakeholder needs).&nbsp; These teams may also reduce cost if possible.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">As
shown in Figure 11, from the Problem-Formulation model, there is a small set of
possible patterns of useful and harmful functions, each of which corresponds to
a logical question that should be asked to determine if there’s a better
possible design. [Terninko 98] These questions are automatically generated from
the PF model. The supported brainstorming process is facilitated using these
questions in an order based on their height in the PF model (top to bottom) and
proceeds down the branches of the PF model that the Value Analysis indicated
were the best opportunities to add value.&nbsp; Since the questions are
extremely open-ended for the purpose of facilitation, it is possible to generate
questions that are one step less open, in that they pursue a particular
conceptual line of change.&nbsp; There are many established sources of these
conceptual lines of change, including the TRIZ principles [Altshuller 98], the
USIT solution strategies [Sickafus 97], the Lateral Thinking techniques [De Bono
90], and&nbsp; &quot;Thinkertoys&quot; [Michalko 91].&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">As
shown in Figure 12, CI uses “Pugh Concept Selection” [Pugh 91] to evaluate
concepts and compare them against a common baseline concept.&nbsp; The
Value-Based Gauge created as the result of Value Modeling is used as the
weighted selection criteria.&nbsp; Pugh Concept Selection evaluates each
system-level concept against a common baseline, which is either the current
product design, or a surrogate (the same system that was used as the baseline
for PF modeling and for Functional Modeling).&nbsp; For each concept, each
product or process characteristic is assessed in comparison with the baseline
design.&nbsp; The concept either performs better (&quot;+&quot;) with respect to
this characteristic than the baseline, the same (&quot;S&quot;), or worse
(&quot;-&quot;).&nbsp; As a result, Pugh produces 3 values for each concept:</span></font></p>

</span></font></span></font><font size="2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">how
beneficial the concept is, vs. the value of the baseline (the sum of the weights
of characteristics scoring &quot;+&quot;),</span></font></p>

deficient the concept is, vs. the value of the baseline (the sum of the weights
of characteristics scoring &quot;-&quot;), and</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

font-family:Symbol">·<font size="1" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></font></span></font><font size="2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">the
total value of the concept, vs. the value of the baseline (the sum of the
weights of characteristics scoring &quot;+&quot; minus the sum of the weights of
characteristics scoring &quot;-&quot;).&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Note
that the total doesn’t tell the whole story.&nbsp; For example, two concepts
could have the same total, while one has excellent advantages along with
terrible deficiencies, while the other could just have a few modest advantages
and deficiencies.&nbsp; All 3 values are presented and the team's judgement is
used to interpret the results.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Since
Pugh Concept Selection compares all concepts against a baseline, it minimizes
the number of comparisons that must be considered, as compared with methods such
as &quot;paired comparisons.&quot; [Kaufman 89] Since CI provides a direct
computational chain, linking stakeholder needs weighting, QFD, and Pugh Concept
Selection, validating the QFD and the concept evaluations is easy.&nbsp;
Scenarios are used to establish extreme points at which they provide selections
that agree with the team's perception.&nbsp; If a scenario doesn't provide
sensible selections, the relevant portions of the evaluations and then the QFD
are examined to determine whether the team's perceptions, the QFD or the
evaluations are at fault.&nbsp; This quickly flushes out evaluation
inconsistencies.&nbsp; Since the QFD is meant to explicitly capture the
understanding of the team, if it yields results with which the team disagrees,
then it is immediately clear where better information or clarification is
required.&nbsp; Typical scenarios that can be usefully explored to validate the
QFD and the concept evaluations are alternate markets, future markets, and
&quot;gut-feel&quot; weightings.&nbsp; Once the QFD and the evaluations have
been validated in this fashion, the individual stakeholder-need weightings can
be validated by considering them individually and in meaningful groupings as the
weights on the rows of the QFD.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Pugh
Concept Selection also makes it easy to identify which features of different
concepts should be combined to yield higher-value hybrid concepts.</span></font></p>
<h1><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Step
5: Risk-Reduced Development Planning (RRDP)</span></font></b></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Once
one or more concepts have been selected, the conceptual-design team must create
a development plan so that the investment decision, to develop the concept, can
be weighed against competing alternative investments (based on metrics such as
ROI, NPV, expected value).&nbsp; Technology development and product development
both involve considerable risk.&nbsp; Risk is defined as the product of
uncertainty of failure and the associated severity of failure.&nbsp; Risk is
reduced by either reducing uncertainty, by gathering information or conducting
tests or analyses, or by reducing the severity of failure, by increasing the
expected value of &quot;fallback&quot; or contingency plans.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">It
is clear that if risk can be reduced earlier within development, then decisions
can be made with greater certainty, and consequently less rework will be
necessary.&nbsp; Less rework means shorter time to market and reduced
development cost. Risk-Reduced Development Planning is a combination of
risk-management best practices [Duncan 96] that a team can use to create a
development plan that reduces risk as quickly as possible.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">A
common problem during the development of product systems arises due to
insufficient communication between sub-system organizational groups.&nbsp; When
fallback plans are planned without sufficient communication, it is common that
some of the sub-system fallback plans have unforeseen complications elsewhere in
the system and are thus infeasible.&nbsp; A design team can improve the
management of risk by planning system-wide fallback plans explicitly, so that
their system-wide viability is assured.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">A
plan that identifies when risk will be reduced can be used to reduce
time-to-market in another way.&nbsp; Passport (&quot;stage-gate&quot; or
&quot;tollgate&quot;) reviews can be scheduled to occur soon after significant
risk reduction steps have occurred, to minimize the delay from the moment that
information is gained to the moment that it is used to decide how to
proceed.&nbsp; This delay is wasted time and should be minimized.</span></font></p>

primary uncertainty issues are identified and assessed based on their likelihood
of failure.&nbsp; For each uncertainty issue, the likelihood of failure is
comprised of four probabilities that are based on assessment of
technology-readiness gaps that routinely lead product development programs to
failure.&nbsp; For each uncertainty issue, these gaps assess its intellectual
difficulty, the definition and stability of its requirements, the ability to
measure its success, and the availability and capability of resources for
it.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

shown in Figure 13, an initial development plan is formulated and the resulting
risk portfolio is considered, along with the change in that risk portfolio that
would result, if the plan were executed.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">&nbsp;Risk
involves three additional factors: &quot;time criticality&quot; (when the
uncertainty is reduced), dependencies between uncertainties, and severity of
adopting fallback plans.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Time
criticality is a factor affecting uncertainty.&nbsp; It is the mean time, during
the span of the relevant portion of the development program, at which the
uncertainty is actually reduced.&nbsp; Clearly, if test results show, during the
last day of the program, that the fallback plan must be adopted, then there is
no choice -- time and budget are both exhausted.&nbsp; However, if test results
yield the same result during the first days of the program, there are many
options -- people are creative and there is plenty of time and budget to find
viable alternatives.&nbsp; The later uncertainty is reduced, the higher the
effective uncertainty and, consequently, the risk of failure.&nbsp; Time
criticality is a multiplying factor that rises exponentially in time to penalize
the late resolution of uncertainty.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">Dependencies
between uncertainties can either increase or decrease their effective
uncertainty.&nbsp; When some uncertainty issues adopt their fallback plans,
others automatically adopt their fallback plans, regardless of how well they
were proceeding.&nbsp; For example, if feasibility of design of a new power
supply is one uncertainty issue for a system, and feasibility of design of a
multiplexing power-distribution system is another, then fallback to the existing
power supply would force abandonment of the new power-distribution system, even
if it was actually feasible.&nbsp; On the other hand, when some uncertainty
issues adopt their fallback plans, other uncertainty issues are much more likely
to succeed.&nbsp; For example, feasibility of design of the system's
thermal-management may be assured to succeed once fallback to the existing power
supply occurs.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;">For
each uncertainty issue, the severity of adopting its fallback plan is the
remaining element of risk.&nbsp; Severity indicates the loss of stakeholder
value involved in adopting the fallback plan.&nbsp; This is the only element of
value that is involved in risk.&nbsp; It can be assessed using either the
weighted stakeholder needs or the value-based gauge.</span></font></p>

Innovation (CI) process, its novelty is largely its integration and
simplification of these best practice methods into a streamlined, repeatable
process that can be taught, facilitated and used regularly to drive innovation
and stimulate rapid business decision-making.</span></font></p>

Stakeholders are those affected by the product or process design, and whose
perspective is considered important (typically due to influence on the
purchasing decision).&nbsp; Typical stakeholders include customers (divided into
relevant market segments), regulatory agencies, and organizations within the
value chain (e.g., new-product design &amp; manufacturing, maintenance, repair
&amp; overhaul).</p>
