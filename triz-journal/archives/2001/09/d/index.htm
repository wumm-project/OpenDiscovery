<p>Abstract</p>
</b>
<p>It is a commonly held view that ‘<i>90% of the problem is defining what the
problem is</i>’. In actual fact, every time the statement or a derivative of it
appears, the importance of problem definition seems to tend ever higher as a
proportion of the total problem. The &quot; 5W's and an H &quot; and related techniques to
be discussed in this article are aimed at helping problem (or indeed, looking at
the opposite side of the coin, ‘opportunity’) owners to help in the definition
process. Used in conjunction with TRIZ, the techniques are shown to be effective
in helping to find the contradictions and harmful effects crucial to successful
application of the TRIZ solving tools. This paper describes the basic TRIZ
philosophy underlying various TRIZ tools and techniques, and the way they
integrate most effectively with systematic problem definition tools. </p>

<p>Problem Definition using TRIZ tools:</p>
</b></font>
<p>TRIZ consists of many problem solving tools and several different ways of
classifying them. The first and the main task in inventive problem solving by
TRIZ, however, still remains to be the toughest one - to identify and formulate
the problem. The purpose of this article is to concentrate on this aspect and to
show how our awareness of the TRIZ solving tools should influence our search
strategies during the definition stage. In the very broadest terms, TRIZ can be
divided into four main stages as shown in Figure 1. </p>

</b>
<p>We will be concentrating here on the ‘definition stage’, but using the
‘select’ and ‘solve’ stages to help us in our quest for the ‘right’ problem. By
‘select’, we mean the rules and guidelines which influence which of the TRIZ
solve tools is most relevant to a given problem situation. The principal problem
definition methodology adopted in this article is based on a very simple premise
- ask relevant questions until we get the answer. Like W.E. Deming has once said
&quot;Ask why 5 times&quot;, below is a compiled list of questions one ought to ask to get
the ‘right’ answer. Questions we usually ask begin with 5 W's &quot;Who?&quot;, &quot;What?&quot;,
Where?”, &quot;When?&quot; and &quot;Why?&quot;. The last one, &quot;Why?&quot; is asked repeatedly till we
get the answer! To complete the sequence of questions we need to add one more
question starting with &quot;How?&quot; in an effort to find a possible answer or solution
to the problem. We will therefore use the phrase &quot;5W's and an H&quot; first to
identify the problem and then to provide a possible solution to it. Below we
offer a compilation of &quot;5W's and an H&quot; as used for each of the TRIZ stages given
above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why-What’s Stopping Analysis</p>
<p>First, however, as an aid to assist in our attempts to think about problem
definition hierarchy, it is useful to introduce here a modified version of the
‘Why-What’s-Stopping?’ analysis tool first developed by Basadur (1). The tool
provides users with a structure through which to visualise an initial problem
statement in the context of its broader and narrower context. The tool is aimed
at overcoming the highly common situation which starts with statements like ‘the
problem is…’ and continues a few seconds later with a headlong plunge into
problem solving mode. This phenomenon is one of the most important
manifestations of psychological inertia. Countless situations point to the fact
that the initial problem definition turns out to be anything but the ‘right’
one. So, the tool takes the initial ‘the problem is…’ statement and forces the
user to think about the broader and narrower problem. A typical schema is
reproduced in Figure 2. Basically, the user uses the ‘Why?’ question to broaden
the problem and uses the question ‘What’s Stopping?’ to narrow the question. In
keeping with the ‘ask why 5 times’ philosophy, the schema can be broadened or
narrowed multiple times. (In line with Deming’s statement, it would be very
unlikely that we would have to repeat the why cycle more than five times to get
to the root cause - in practice it will usually take less.) At the end of the
process, the user has obtained a vertical stack of hierarchical problem
definitions, from which a much clearer picture of what the ‘right’ problem is
should emerge in conjunction with some of the strategies described below.</p>
<p>We will see an example of this schema and its ‘5Ws and an H’ relatives in
action in a future article.</p>

<p>In this next section, we explore how the different TRIZ problem solving tools
should influence the following ‘5Ws and an H’ questions we ask while trying to
define the ‘right’ problem:</p>
<table border="4" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">
<b>
    W1. Who </b>has the problem?<b><p>W2. What </b>does the problem seem to be? </p>
<b>
<p>W3. When</b> does the problem occur? </p>
<b>
<p>W4. Where</b>
does the problem occur?</p>
<b>
<p>W5. Why</b>
does the problem occur? What is root cause?</p>
<p>And</p>
<b>
<p>H1. How</b>
does the problem occur? How can the problem be solved?</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<b>
<p>W1. Who
has the problem? : </b>This clearly identifies the person
connected with the problem. He could be one who is using the final product or
anyone in the line-up of concept-to-market or a person at any of the product
Life-stages from design through manufacture, transport, use, repair and
disposal.</p>
<b>
<p>W2. What
does the problem seem to be? : </b>This is the type of
question we ask in order to narrow the problem and focus in on key issues - as
seen in the ‘why-what’s-stopping’ analysis. It is a good idea to keep the TRIZ
solve tools in mind when asking the ‘what?’ question: </p>
<p>1. Try to specify conflict/contradictions -- as a technical contradiction or
as a physical contradiction</p>
<p>2. Try to specify harmful action/interaction/effects</p>
<p>3. Try to specify inefficient useful action/interaction/effects</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>W3. When
does the problem occur? : </b>Clearly identifying the time
related aspects of the problem. When does the conflict occur? Is the key
question here. In line with ARIZ thinking, if we can identify a time of the
conflict, the time just before and the time just after, we have a strong basis
for identifying physical contradictions which may be amenable to separation in
time. If there is a physical contradiction amenable to separation in time, the
‘when’ question is the key to identifying it.</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>W4. Where
does the problem occur? : </b>Again the key is relating to
the ARIZ concept of ‘zones of conflict’. Determine what is the zone of conflict
looking at the super-system, system and sub-system. The aim again is to keep in
mind the TRIZ physical contradiction solution strategies - and in particular to
be looking for places/spaces where the problem does and doesn’t occur. If there
is a physical contradiction amenable to separation in space, the ‘where’
question is the key to identifying it.</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>W5. Why
does the problem occur? {“Ask WHY 5 times “ - W. E. Deming} : </b>In the ‘why-what’s stopping?’ parallel, the ‘why?’ question is
all about broadening the problem and specifically heading back towards root
causes. The process is often helped by thinking about the ‘function’ that
creates/leads to the problem and the presence and interactions between
substances ( “tool” and “object” ) and fields (energy, enabling, acting force)
present - is “tool”, “object” or “field” causing the problem? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>H1. How
does the problem occur? : </b>The how question is present
to encourage us to think about the underlying causes and effects of the problem.
How does the conflict arise? The how question and its relation to cause and
effect plays a significant part of the Theory of Constraints problem definition
methodology (2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other Times During Problem Definition When 5Ws and an H are used:</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5 W’s and an H for Harmful Effects :</p>
</b>
<p>1. Who is affected by the harmful action? </p>
<p>2. What is the result of the harmful action?</p>
<p>3. When does the harmful action occur? (time of problem)</p>
<p>4. Where does the harmful action or effects appear? (zone of problem)</p>
<p>5. Why does the harmful action occur? (root-cause of the problem)</p>
<p>6. How does the harmful action arise?</p>

<p>Using 5W’s and an H to identify the Stage of Evolution :</p>
</b>
<p>1. What is main function of the system? - What parts are needed to synthesize
the required function? </p>

</p>
<p>3. How to dynamize the parts? - Or How have the parts been dynamized (in the
past)? </p>
<p>4. How to control and hence automate the function?</p>
<p>These questions have much in common with the concept of ‘evolutionary
potential’ - a topic discussed at length in Reference 3.</p>
<font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
</font>
<p>Evolution timing is another critical issue in problem definition. The key
question here is ‘When will the evolution occur?’ There are no definitive
answers to this question. Good pointers come from Reference 4, which describes
the emergence of the administrative contradiction for a sufficiently valuable
sector of the existing and prospective future customer base becomes dissatisfied
with the current offering - Figure 3.</p>

<p>Ideal Final Result (IFR) and Ideality:</p>
</b></i></font>
<p></p>
<p>Ideal Final Result is very useful concept as it, </p>
<p>1. gives an implementation-free description (after the problem has been
solved)</p>
<p>2. focuses on functions needed (and not on the currently used processes and /
or equipment)</p>
<p>3. eliminates rework (by solving the ‘right’ problem the first time itself)</p>
<p>4. leads to breakthrough thinking (about the solution and not
inhibited/hindered by intervening problem) </p>
<p>The IFR has the following <b>characteristics </b>(as defined in (6)).</p>
<b>
<dir>
  </b>
  <p>Eliminates the deficiencies of the original system</p>
  <p>Preserves advantages of the original system</p>
  <p>Does not make the original system more complicated (uses free or available
  resources)</p>
  <p>Does not introduce new disadvantages</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</dir>
<b>
<p>Ask 5W’s and an H to help formulate IFR :</p>
</b>
<p>1. Who has the problem? (person connected with a life-stage)</p>
<p>2. What does the customer want? What is the ideal function?</p>
<p>(think of some implementation-free (ideal) solution)</p>
<p>3. When does the problem occur? (time of conflict)</p>
<p>4. Where does the problem occur? (zone of conflict)</p>
<p>5. Why does the problem occur? (root-cause of the problem)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Then use the set of questions to formulate IFR :</p>
</b>
<p>1. What is the final aim?</p>
<p>2. What is the ideal final result?</p>
<p>3. What are the obstacles to achieving this?</p>
<p>4. Why do (these) obstacles interfere?</p>
<p>5. How would this interference disappear? Under what conditions?</p>
<p>Remember, of course, that one of the key issues when using the tool is to
formulate the IFR from the perspective of the customer. There are frequent (and
often seemingly intractable) differences between the customers IFR and that of
the supplier and, for that matter, other parts of the supply system. Thus the
‘What does the customer want?’ question is often paralleled with a ‘What can we
supply (and still remain in profitable business)?’ question in order to help
answer the key question here ‘Who’s Ideal Final Result?’</p>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>
</b>
<p>In the same way that the TRIZ system operator (9-Windows) concept should be
an integral part of the way we use each and every stage of TRIZ, the ‘5Ws and an
H’ idea also plays a strong across-the-board part in helping us to define the
‘right’ problem.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the TRIZ problem solving tools should influence how we use the
5Ws and an H in formulating questions during the problem definition stage - and
should help us in making the leap from ‘right’ problem definition to ‘best’
solving tool(s) to solve the problem.</p>
