</b>
<p>Until the end of the year l982, I was prevented from going to the Soviet
Union for my work on Ph. D. dissertation because of many unreasonable
bureaucratic reasons on four occasions. Finally, after I had passed a tiring
exam with many requirements, I flew to the Soviet Union. This time, I studied at
the State University of Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) some thousands of
kilometers away from Baku. On January 2nd, l983, the teacher Mr. Altshutller
replied: “Pleased to get your letter from Leningrad, not somewhere else. It is
wonderful, because there are schools of TRIZ with many instructors and
researchers. They will give you a lot of information about TRIZ as well as its
accomplishments. I am writing immediately here some addresses of those who are
in Leningrad&quot;.</p>
<p>Further, he gave me a list of three with their full names, addresses, and
telephone numbers: V.M. Petrov(2), E.S. Zlotina(3), V.V. Mitrofanov(4) and
wrote: &quot;You tell them that I introduced you to them, and today I will write to
Zlotina about this”. He added: &quot;Today I will also send you the following books:
&quot;Creativity As An Exact Science&quot;, and “The Wings for Icharus” and a new document
“ARIZ-82B”. I’m going to write to the Trizniks(5) in Leningrad and they will
provide you with other materials. How about the Journal “Technology and
Science”(6). Have you subscribed to the one for the year l983? And how about the
old ones? You must read the issues from l to 9 from the year l981, and from 3 to
5 and 8 from the year l982”. He reminded me of his ten-year old suggestion,
taking my interest in psychological inertia into his account: &quot;I really expect
you to do something on &quot;Guiding of the Usage of Physical Effects in Inventing&quot;,
while you are living in the Union these days. If necessary, the above mentioned
Journal will publish your research, or also your research on psychology... Happy
New Year with many best wishes for your health and prosperity in the days living
in Leningrad&quot;. After receiving the teacher Mr. Altshuller's letter I contacted
Volodia Petrov and Fira Zlotina. And we became friends.</p>
<p>At the beginning of October, l983, I went to Baku to visit my old places, my
old teachers and classmates, especially the teacher Mr. Altshuller's family.
Never has the trip faded from my mind. It was an extremely emotional,
unforgetable one. Maybe you can guess why. I myself, during the last ten years,
had worked, was now married with a child, had faced the severe reality of daily
life and work. As a result, I looked much more experienced than before. So this
time, meeting Mr. and Mrs. Altshuller I could discuss with them many subjects in
a deeper and more thoughtful way, even some “delicate” topics in comparison with
the standards of that time. I knew much more about his personal life with its
many ups and downs as well as his intentions about TRIZ. I told him about what I
had done in Vietnam (I had taught the first course on TRIZ in Vietnam in 1977)
and my opinions about TRIZ … He gave me positive encouragement about my work,
gave me his own ideas and his own experiences. They were so precious to me. If
he had some points to disagree with me, he just suggested, “You may be right in
such a case”. Then, he presented me with many materials on TRIZ and others
including magazines, books, and typewritten research papers.</p>
<p>He saw me off at the bus station. He went with his back just beginning to be
bent over and a slightly slow walk which I had not seen before. I felt moved and
loved him so much. From the bottom of my heart, I prayed for his health. I
wished that he would live a long, long time.</p>
<p>Quite different from my arrival with a light traveling bag, I flew back to
Leningrad with my overweight baggage. Although I did not have to pay tax for 20
kilos according to the rules, additionally, I had to pay the same amount as an
excess baggage charge for the presents from my old teachers and classmates. The
teacher Mr. Atlshuller’s gift alone weighed over 10 kilos.</p>
<p>Thanks to him and TRIZ colleagues, especially, my new friends: Volodia and
Fira, I always kept up with the development of and new studies on TRIZ
(including the manuscript materials that would be published later in the form of
articles or books). Leafing back through his letters, I encountered the things
he used to write to me, such as “ Let me know about this material... that one,
have you got them yet ? If not , I will send them to you &quot;. Or ,&quot; In the package
I am sending to you today there are the following materials...”</p>
<p>I remember one episode. It was the third time I was living in the Soviet
Union (again in Leningrad), doing my research on my Doctor of Science's degree,
and I discovered two books in the package he had sent me. These books were
written by his former students about TRIZ and about how to teach it with
acknowledgements and dedications to him from the authors in ink on the first
page. At once, I phoned him to confirm: &quot;Genrikh Saulovich, you must be mistaken
in sending me the books whose authors had presented them to you&quot;. He just
laughed, &quot;No , I am not mistaken. You need them more than I do&quot; Hearing nothing
from me on the end of the line, he thought that I must be so embarrassed. So, he
added, “Don’t worry. I will tell them that I presented the books to you from me.
Now let's change the subject…”.</p>
<p>Here is his last letter of February 2nd, l997: “I’ ve got your letter of
January 6th, l997 with your report on your teaching trip in Malaysia and your
photos. Thank you so much”.</p>
<p>“I am enclosing here with this letter for you the “Information” about the
TRIZ Association. I would like you to know all about its activities”.</p>
<p>“TRIZ has begun its long steps towards the West. Many TRIZ related institutes
and schools have been established, the translation of TRIZ is in progress. The
book “And Suddenly the Inventor Appeared” that was translated into English (in
America) has just been printed. As soon as I receive it, I will send it to you.
Write to me more often. Good luck !”</p>
<p>“PS: Did you get the two books “How to Become a Genius” and &quot;The Corner of
Attack?”. </p>
<p>After that, I did not get any letters from him any more although I had
written to him several times. I thought that, maybe, he had moved to a new
address like before, when his family went to Petrozavodsk from Baku to live,
but... maybe... sometimes I shuddered with fear when my mind was lead to that
terrible thing... In the end of the year l998, our Center for Scientific and
Technical Creativity (CSTC) was connected with the Internet, on American TRIZ
websites I got the distressing news that he had passed away on September 24th,
l998 after a long sickness.</p>
<p>Getting the bad news, I quickly sent the teacher Mr. Altshuller's family a
fax of condolence to share the great loss all Trizniks had suffered. Then I
phoned Mrs. Valentina Nhikolaevna Zhuravliova, his wife, to talk more about him
and remember with her my sweet memories of him. During the conversation, she
repeated several times, &quot;You Vietnamese students were very lucky to have a long
time to study with him. Many Trizniks did not get an opportunity like that&quot;.</p>
<p>In my mind, I often think I had a very good opportunity to improve myself
immensly when I was his student, working and corresponding with him. It is said
that one of the most effective ways of learning is imitating, willingly
following other's examples. This impulse naturally comes from the learner's need
and internal aspiration. Considering the typical example of a child's learning
to speak at home, we can see that he lives, plays, and communicates naturally
without realizing he is learning and accepting the effect of nurture from his
teachers. But he can learn how to speak from the family members very rapidly
with everyday improvement. If you are lucky enough to have regular contact with
those who get your admiration, your love, and who are better than you in many
aspects, you will learn a lot from them almost as if you had been infected by
them, although they do not have the intention of teaching you at all, and you
yourself do not have the intention of learning, either. This is such a natural,
effective way of learning that what you have learned will be digested and
transformed into your own flesh and blood. It is not a borrowing process.</p>
<p>Remembering what I knew about him (directly or from TRIZ colleagues and
other's memoirs), the idea sometimes springs up in my mind that he was real and
not real at the same time. He was real in his worldly body as my teacher. And he
was not real like a legendary hero stepping out of the pages on which great
names are written, for I had read much about them. Many of them encountered
obstacles, they were even crushed by the evil powers, but with all their
efforts, endurance, strong will and, of course, their talents, they contributed
their great achievements to mankind's prosperity. I knew all this, but before
meeting the teacher Mr. Altshuller, I had no chance to contact let alone to
learn from them, or to work with such people.</p>
<p>The teacher Mr. Altshuller's life, indeed, had been unlucky even when he was
in his mother's womb. His father married his mother when they were working
together for the Azerbaigian News Agency (Azerbaigian was one of 15 Republics of
the Soviet Union) in Baku. His father had already been married once previously
to marrying his mother. So his grandmother on his mother's side objected to the
new mariage so violently that his parents had to move to Tashkent city, the
capital of the Republic Uzbekistan, where he was born on October 15, 1926. In
1928, his family returned to Baku amid the cool attitudes of his mother's
relatives.</p>
<p>His parents worked for the Press. So his home, of course, was packed with
books that interested him from a very young age. He went to schools where there
were many professional and devoted teachers. This enabled him to look for new
things, arouse his curiosity about inventions. He got his first patent when he
was still at high school.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union was attacked by Fascism in 1941, at the time he was 15.
After high school, he joined the army and was assigned to an infantry regiment.
Then, he was recommended to train in an air force school. No sooner had he
finished the training, than the war ended. He applied for a position as a navy
patent examiner at the Patent Office of Caspian Fleet, located in Baku. Right
here, his interest in invention from a young age was combined with the needs of
his job: he studied the patent information, examined invention documents, gave
his advice to inventors. In 1946, he began the first steps on the path to
constructing TRIZ. His desire to help the general populous to invent
methodologically in a scientific way became stronger than his original purpose:
how to get many patents for himself. </p>
<p>In 1949, he and his associate Mr. R. Shapiro directly wrote Stalin a
thirty-page letter which took them 6 months. Beside the presentation of their
invention, they proposed many measures to improve the Soviet patent system and
creative, inventive activities in the Soviet Union. In the end, he and his
friend were mistakenly accused of terrorism, arrested in 1950 and sentenced to
twenty-five year's penal servitude. He was exiled to Vorkuta, a hostile area
with ice and snow, to work as a coal miner. During the time he was in his labor
camps his father died. His mother applied many times for his amnesty, but
failed. She was so disappointed that she committed suicide in 1953. Stalin died
in the same year. So many sentences were again judged. In 1954, he and his
friend, Mr. Shapiro were released. Back in Baku, he had to change his workplace
several times, for a former prisoner was not welcome when he applied for a job.
Finally, he decided to be his own employer. He worked as a freelance. He turned
to writing for newspapers, then writing science fiction under the pen name
Genrikh Altov. With the little money he earned he had time to develop his ideas
originating from 1946. Sometimes, his life was not secure in this way. He had to
sell his books, which he had collected over years and which he appreciated like
his own children, to second - hand book-stores.</p>
<p>The first results of his and Mr. Shapiro's research, which laid the basic
foundation for TRIZ, were published in the Journal &quot;Psychological Issues&quot;( No.
6, 1956, pages 37 - 49). Later, Mr. Shapiro migrated to Israel. So, only the
teacher Mr. Alshuller kept on his study of TRIZ. From 1958, he began to spread
TRIZ through seminars, first in Baku, then in other cities such as Moscow,
Donhetsk, Tambov, Ryazan ... As the results of the success of the seminars, over
9 years from 1959 to 1967, he continuously wrote to the Central Council of the
All Union Association of Inventors and Rationalizators (Russian acronym is VOIR)
with many proposals, but did not receive any positive responses although the
proposals were within Regulations and met the criteria of VOIR. Until, in 1968,
the Central Council's president, Ivanov was seriously sick. So, the secretary of
the Council, V. N. Tiurin took his place temporarily. At that time, the
situation seemed to get out of its darkness. The Public Research Laboratory of
Inventing Methods (OLMI) was opened in 1969 and the Public Institute of
Inventive Creativity (AzOIIT) was formed in Baku in 1971. In 1972, Sofanov, the
newly-elected president of the Central Council of VOIR returned to the old
policies, causing many problems for Mr. Altshuller's activities. The highest
tension point was reached in 1974. On one occasion Mr. Altshuller admitted some
cadres from the School of Perfection of Management Qualification belonging to
the Polish Council of Ministers to study at the AzOIIT, without an official
permit from the VOIR's Central Council. So Sofanov closed OLMI. To give his
protest to the decision, Mr. Altshuller withdrew from AzOIIT.</p>
<p>Since then, the research and spreading of TRIZ has completely relied on the
interest and willingness of volunteers, who expected no financial returns, under
Mr. Altshuller's leadership, without any legal financial support from the
government, or from other societies. Many times he and his followers gave TRIZ
classes in a &quot;nomadical way&quot; from city to city. Then they created TRIZ groups,
centers, schools operating in clubs or cultural houses… Until the 1980s,
hundreds of cities in the Soviet Union with such activities came into being. At
first, he was the only one who taught TRIZ in the 1950s, 3 more began teaching
TRIZ in 1968, and there were over 200 teachers by 1979. After that, conferences
on the special subjects of TRIZ were held in 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988
with more and more participants. The TRIZ Association was established in 1989
and the Journal of TRIZ came into being in 1990. The flourishment of TRIZ led
the State Committee of Invention (GOSKOMIZOBRETENIE) and VOIR to make their
decision to support the teaching system of the methods of invention and
creativity (in Mr. Altshuller's opinion, this decision should have been made 20
years before).</p>
<p>As soon as the cold war ended, the Soviet Union's economy changed into the
market one. So TRIZ development faced other new advantages as well as
disadvantages. Due to the information exchange between the East and the West
being better than before, some developed countries discovered TRIZ and quickly
welcomed it to their countries. Now TRIZ became an international movement and
the term TRIZ became an international term.</p>
<p>Unluckily, at the triumphant time of TRIZ, Mr. Altshuller left us forever
with much love and respect from those who knew him and knew of him. At least, I
think, one thing could console him and all Trizniks, that is he had witnessed
how his loved child TRIZ had been internationally recognized.</p>
<p>There is one Vietnamese saying: &quot;You can make a cake only if you have flour.
It is a true genius who builds his whole cause with empty hands&quot;. In fact, Mr.
Altshuller created his brand new cause from nothing in hard conditions. He
worked without any financial support from the government or other organizations.
You can imagine that at that time the Soviet Union did not follow the market
economy. Its economy consisted of only two components: the national and
collective. They were strictly and directly controlled under the government.
Therefore, all scientific and technical research was concentrated in institutes
and universities that were managed by the state. At that time, he did not belong
to the staff of any organization. Because of that, he could not get his passport
to go abroad to report on TRIZ at international conferences. During
&quot;perestroika&quot; the passport procedure changed but his health would not allow him
to travel abroad. In other words, he had no chance to go out of his country even
to the neighbouring socialist countries right up to the day he died. He also did
not have a Kandidat Nauk degree (Ph.D.) yet he dared to invent a different way
from that accepted by the state scientists in the field of creativity and
innovation. Under the eyes of almost all scientists working for the above state
institutes or universities, he was a &quot;heretic&quot;, incompetent to give his ideas on
professional issues. In addition, there were other discriminations including a
delicate one - he was a Jew.</p>
<p>Thinking about the teacher Mr. Altshuller and his cause I believe that the
following reasons may explain why he persistently followed the ideal he had
discovered and won deep love and respect from his disciples and students.</p>
<dir>
  <p>1. Victor Hugo wrote: &quot;There is one thing stronger than all the armies of
  the world. And that is an idea whose time has come&quot;. </p>
  <p>Apparently, Mr. Altshuller had managed to catch the idea and foresaw the
  &quot;time of idea&quot;; therefore, he became stronger than any obstacle he met on his
  way. And he got more and more supporters, and followers, in his own country as
  well as all over the world. Since the 1990s, more and more researchers have
  predicted that the age of creativity and innovation will come after the age of
  information.</p>
  <p>Not stopping at the creation of TRIZ, he also put his theory and tools into
  action as a great innovator. He knew how mobilize the &quot;intrinsic creative
  resources&quot; inside people to maximum effect, resolved many &quot;physical
  contradictions&quot; in his life and work and always kept the direction towards &quot;
  the ideal system&quot; and &quot;the top ideal final result &quot; in a flexible way.</p>
  <p>What he did was motivated by his great love of mankind which included every
  ordinary person. He used to say things such as, “The inventing process may and
  must be scientific. Creativity science, which will be an exact science, can be
  taught as well as learned in order that everyone (even a housewife) can invent
  in a scientific and methodological way”.</p>
</dir>
<p>Those who knew him all admired his ability to work. Some people believed that
he worked as much as a whole research institute. His huge amount of published
books and articles on creativity and innovation and science fiction stories were
merely the tip of the iceberg. To illustrate his working ability I want to tell
you about his minor deed: his writing and reading letters. Between 1974 and 1986
he cooperated with the newspapers &quot;The Truth for Children&quot; writing the special
column &quot;Invention? So Simple - So Complex” to introduce TRIZ to the youth. After
some publications, he received some hundreds of reponses. Later, there were 6 -
8 thousand letters to him per issue. The amount of letters only relating to this
work which he read was about 22,000. To lead the TRIZ movement, he had to reply
to at least 20 letters a day to his students living in other cities. His great
love helped him overcome any barries, any obstacles ... to calmly control his
own suffering: his father had died; his mother had killed herself while he was
at his penal servitude. In 1985, his only son, Evghenhi (pet name was Gienhia,
about 10 years younger than I) whose unjust death was due to a mistaken appendix
operation at a hospital left him and his family a granddaughter who just born -
Yuna.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties of his life, Mr. Altshuller was lucky in many
aspects. He had a faithful wife, Mrs. Valentina Nhikolaevna, a real friend who
could share everything with him, and he also had his friends, disciples,
followers and students. These may seem ordinary and natural but in reality they
are elusive for many.</p>
<p>One Vietnamese saying states: “ You cannot succeed without the help of your
teachers”.</p>
<p>We all have our own teachers and thank them for their nurture. As a matter of
fact, I have many ones like those. However, the teacher Mr. Altshuller,
truthfully speaking, has given me the deepest impression. I was very lucky to be
his student.</p>
<p>You may question, “What did you manage to learn from him as his student?”. My
answer is: “I have just learned a little from the teacher Mr. Altshuller.
However, this small amount seems great to me because it changed my life in every
way in comparison with the time before.</p>

<p><b>Notes:</p>
</b>
<p>(1) : There are two doctor's degrees in the Soviet Union. The first one
called &quot;Kandidat Nauk&quot; is roughly equivalent to the degree of Doctor of
Philosophy ( D.Ph. or Ph.D.).</p>
<p>The second one called &quot;Doktor Nauk&quot; is the highest degree. It is translated
into English as Doctor of Science (D.Sc. or Sc.D.). The degree &quot;Doktor Nauk&quot; is
awarded for a dissertation where its author having the first degree has opened a
new research direction or solved a highly generalized problem in the given
field.</p>
