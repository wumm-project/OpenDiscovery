<p>Introduction</p>
</b>
<p>In a previous article (see
<a href="http://www.triz-journal.com/archives/2001/08/c/">
http://www.triz-journal.com/archives/2001/08/c/</a>) I described the four main
steps that converted TRIZ into ASIT. One of these steps transformed the forty
principles of TRIZ into ASIT’s five thinking tools: Unification, Multiplication,
Division, Breaking Symmetry and Object Removal. This article will elaborate
further on ASIT’s five tools and supply illustrative examples for each. The
examples will cover a broad spectrum of domains to demonstrate their wide field
of applicability. </p>
<p>As a reminder, TRIZ’s 40 principles were reduced to ASIT’s five
idea-provoking tools by: eliminating principles that are too problem-specific;
eliminating principles that are not used very often; grouping similar principles
together. </p>
<p>Before we delve into detail, here is a short summary of ASIT’s five tools:
</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <b>
    <p>1. Unification</b>: Solve a problem by assigning a new use to an existing
    component. </p>
    <b>
    <p>2. Multiplication</b>: Solve a problem by introducing a slightly modified
    copy of an existing object into the current system.</p>
    <b>
    <p>3. Division</b>: Solve a<font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"> </font>problem by
    dividing an object and reorganizing it parts.</p>
    <b>
    <p>4. Breaking Symmetry</b>: Solve a problem by changing a symmetrical
    situation into an asymmetrical one. </p>
    <b>
    <p>5. Object Removal</b>: Solve a problem by removing an object from the
    system </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>Applying each tool is a five-step process. In the first step we define the
problem world by listing the problem objects and the objects in the environment.
In the second step we prepare for the application of the tool by collecting
relevant data and making a few simple decisions. The third step is where we
actually apply the tool and where the idea is born. In the fourth step the idea
is captured in one sentence, and in the fifth step it is expanded and elaborated
into 4 - 5 sentences. </p>
<p>Here is a detailed description of the tools, including examples: </p>
<b>
<p>The Unification tool</p>
</b>
<p>The following is a problem that I will use to demonstrate the Unification
tool (a classic TRIZ case study): </p>
<p>Here is a description of an experiment to check if materials are resistant in
acidic environments. Different pressures and temperatures are applied to the
samples, metal cubes, which are made from the tested material and placed inside
a metal vessel. (The vessel is used both as a container for the acid and to
control ambient conditions). After the samples are taken out of the vessel they
are examined to test how the acid affected them. The problem is that the vessel
itself is damaged as the acid attacks it as well.</p>
<p>We will now solve this problem using the Unification tool. </p>
<p>Note: I will use the following format throughout the presentation of the
techniques: Everything between curly brackets {}, is the problem solver’s
response to the tool’s instruction; everything in smaller font is an annotation
explaining the relevant step. </p>
<p>1. <i>Define the problem world</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    </i>
    <p>Make a list of problem objects</p>
    <p>{Acid, Vessel} </p>
    <p>Make a list of environment objects</p>
    <p>{Samples, Air} </p>
    <font SIZE="2">
    <p>The problem objects are those actually involved in generating the
    undesired effect. This explains why the SAMPLES are not listed here - they
    do no harm and are not being damaged. </p>
    </font>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>2. <i>Prepare for Unification</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    </i>
    <p>Define the undesired effect</p>
    <font SIZE="2">
    <p>The undesired effect is a very short and factual description of the
    problem. It usually takes the form of stating what damage object X inflicts
    on object Y.</p>
    </font>
    <p>{The ACID attacks the VESSEL}</p>
    <font SIZE="2">
    <p>Please note how simple and non-creative this definition is. ASIT prevents
    the problem solver from trying to be too smart at the wrong stage in the
    problem solving process.</p>
    </font>
    <p>Derive the wanted action that eliminates the undesired effect</p>
    <font SIZE="2">
    <p>The wanted action is usually derived from the undesired effect by adding
    the words “to prevent …from…” While the progression from the undesired
    effect description to an action description seems trivial, it’s importance
    is mainly psychological: to transform a description of a fact to a
    description of an action.</font> </p>
    <p>{To prevent the ACID from attacking the VESSEL}</p>
    <font SIZE="2">
    <p>Some people would say that this is already very close to the solution. My
    reaction is this:” is a solution not what we are looking for?” There is no
    psychological or other law stating that we should move in circles before we
    make an attempt to find a solution. </p>
    </font>
    <p>Select an object to perform the wanted action</p>
    <p>{SAMPLES}</p>
    <font SIZE="2">
    <p>If you happen to be a TRIZ instructor you are probably familiar with the
    following response from course participants: “You selected the SAMPLES
    because you know the solution”. </p>
    <p>Well I have to admit that I do indeed know the solution. But seriously,
    the idea is that we select one object at a time until we arrive at the
    solution. For the sake of brevity, I selected the object that leads to the
    solution. </p>
    </font>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>3. <i>Apply Unification</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    </i>
    <p>Imagine the selected object performing the wanted action. Keep in mind
    that: </p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>- The selected object can be modified </p>
        <p>- Other objects can be modified</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <font SIZE="2">
    <p>Here we simply have to imagine the SAMPLES preventing the ACID from
    attacking the VESSEL. (Each of these three objects can also be modified to
    help prevent this).</p>
    </font>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>4. <i>Define your core idea in one sentence</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    </i>
    <p>{The SAMPLES will contain the ACID, thus preventing it coming into
    contact with the VESSEL} </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>5. <i>Elaborate the idea in 3 - 5 sentences</i> </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>{We will drill a hole in the samples and pour the ACID into the hole.
    This way the ACID will never come into contact with the VESSEL. The SAMPLES
    need to be large enough so that the ACID will not leak out}</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>[Repeat steps 2 - 5 until you arrive at a satisfactory idea]</p>
<b>
<p>The Multiplication tool</p>
</b>
<p>To demonstrate the Multiplication tool I intentionally selected a
non-physical problem to show you that ASIT tools are indeed universal in
application. </p>
<p>So here is the problem: Your kid comes home and you want to know everything
about his day at kindergarten. You ask him, “How was your day?” and he answers
abruptly, “It was good,” and then turns on the TV… </p>
<p>1. <i>Define the problem world</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    </i>
    <p>Make a list of problem objects</p>
    <p>{Kid, Story about his/her day, TV, parent} </p>
    <p>Make a list of environment objects</p>
    <p>{Kindergarten} </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>2. <i>Prepare for Multiplication</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    </i>
    <p>Define the undesired effect</p>
    <p>{The KID does not tell the STORY to the PARENT}</p>
    <font SIZE="2">
    <p>Please note again how simple and non-creative this definition is. It is a
    natural tendency of problem solvers to be too smart too soon. ASIT tries to
    prevent it. </p>
    </font>
    <p>Derive the wanted action that eliminates the undesired effect</p>
    <font SIZE="2">
    <p>This time we do not need to prevent something from happening, but rather
    to force something to happen. </p>
    </font>
    <p>{To make the KID tell the STORY}</p>
    <p>Select an object to perform the wanted action</p>
    <p>{STORY}</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>3. <i>Apply Multiplication</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    </i>
    <p>Imagine a new, slightly modified, copy of the selected object added to
    the problem world and performing the wanted action. Keep in mind that: </p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>- The new object may not be the same as the existing one </p>
        <p>- There may be a desired interaction between the new object and the
        original one </p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <font SIZE="2">
    <p>Here we simply need to imagine bringing in a new STORY that will make the
    KID tell his own STORY. </p>
    </font>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>4. <i>Define your core idea in one sentence</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    </i>
    <p>{A new STORY about the day at kindergarten will make the KID tell his own
    STORY} </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>5. <i>Elaborate the idea in 3 - 5 sentences</i> </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>{We will tell our KID the following: “OK, if you don’t want to tell me
    what happened at kindergarten, I’ll tell the STORY”. Then we start telling
    the STORY based on small details and facts that we know about the KID’S life
    at kindergarten. The KID will be attracted to the STORY about himself and
    will correct all the incorrect details in the STORY}</p>

<b>
<p>The Division tool </p>
</b>
<p>The following problem demonstrates the Division tool: </p>
<p>Mountaineers use sophisticated electronic barometers to measure air pressure.
</p>
<p>After receiving many complaints about their barometers, a manufacturer
discovered that a tiny electronic component in the instrument was sensitive to
extreme cold in mountainous areas. The manufacturer decided to develop a new
barometer that would be resistant to cold. Research quickly showed that it would
not be possible to find a replacement for the tiny component affected by the
cold. The manufacturer almost gave up until one of his engineers came up with a
brilliant solution to the problem</p>
<p>1. <i>Define the problem world</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    </i>
    <p>Make a list of problem objects</p>
    <p>{Barometer, Cold air }</p>
    <p>Make a list of environment objects</p>
    <p>{Mountaineer, Mountain, Ice, Snow}</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>2. <i>Prepare for Division</p>
<dir>

    <p>Make a list of the parts of this object</p>
    <p>{Display, Electronic component, Wiring, Pressure sensor} </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>3. <i>Apply Division</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    </i>
    <p>Imagine one of the parts being separated from the rest, and then think
    what would happen if: </p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>- That part was to be moved to another place</p>
        <p>- That part was to be treated differently from the others</p>
        <p>- That part was to show up or disappear at different times</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>{What would happen if we moved the ELECTRONIC COMPONENT to another
    place?}</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>4. <i>Define your core idea in one sentence</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    </i>
    <p>{The ELECTRONIC DEVICE will be moved to the MOUNTAINEER’S body} </p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>5. <i>Elaborate the idea in 4-5 sentences</i> </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>{The ELECTRONIC DEVICE will be separated from the rest of the BAROMETER
    and moved to the MOUNTAINEER’S body, which maintains a constant temperature
    of 37 degrees Celsius. The DEVICE will be connected to the BAROMETER by a
    wire. The manufacturer will supply with the BAROMETER a means for attaching
    the DEVICE to the body} </p>

<b>
<p>The Breaking Symmetry tool </p>
</b>
<p>In the following problem I will demonstrate the Breaking Symmetry tool:</p>
<p>Regular candles drip wax while burning, thus dirtying the surrounding area -
the residue that does not burn drips down the side of the candle causing the
messy drops of wax. Suggest a way of stopping the candle from dripping<b>.</p>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>{The outer part of the candle, due to its higher melting temperature,

<p>The Object Removal tool </p>
</b>
<p>The following problem demonstrates the use of the Object Removal tool: </p>
<p>Currently, helicopter pilots are unable to escape the helicopter in case of
technical problems. A good solution would be to eject the pilot upward before he
parachutes down. But this is impossible because of the danger of being hit by
the rotor. </p>

  <dir>
    <p>{Since the PILOT made a decision to eject, the HELICOPTER is not
    functioning and the ROTOR is actually not needed any more. The idea is to
    fix explosives to the ROTOR axis to be explode just before the ejection} </p>

<b>
<p>Conclusion</p>
</b>
<p>This article presented ASIT’s five thinking tools. I tried to show that the
tools are universal, widely applicable, domain independent and easy to learn.
The examples presented the application of the tools in their pure form: only one
tool was applied to solve each problem. It is also possible to use more than one
tool (e.g. removing an object with Object Removal and then fulfilling its action
through Unification) but this is beyond the scope of this article. </p>
<p>The next article in this series will deal with the application of ASIT’s
tools to invent new products. </p>
