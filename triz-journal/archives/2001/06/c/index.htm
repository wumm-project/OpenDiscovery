<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Abstract</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since its introduction to the West around a decade ago, TRIZ
has proved itself to be an extremely potent problem solving and product
innovation method.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key to successful problem solving usually starts with the
definition of appropriate physical and technical contradictions. To a large
extent the ‘Contradictions’ part of TRIZ then ends with a number of
candidate Inventive Principle recommendations from the list of 40 currently
known possibilities.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Inventive Principles are necessarily generic in nature.
Subsequent application of this type of generic statement to the inevitably
specific conditions of a particular problem can often be a process fraught with
uncertainty and unpredictability.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This article takes a close look at what happens in this gap
between generic Inventive Principle and specific problem solution in order to
establish whether there might be some general rules applicable to a more
automated systematic innovation process.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.0 Introduction</p>
  </blockquote>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of texts on human creativity and creative problem
solving is vast. Before TRIZ, the quantity of useful - in the context of the
world of the engineer ‘useable’ - output from all of this activity amounts
to very little.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The work of TRIZ researchers on problem classification and
the discovery that inventors have thus far used only a very small number of
Inventive Principles is already profoundly changing this picture. That there are
only these small number of Principles has meant their systemisation in software
form has been relatively easy. The emergence of a number of commercial packages
built around TRIZ ideas is therefore not surprising.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With or without software, TRIZ offers a systematic innovation
process built primarily on the concept of abstraction - in which a problem owner
maps from a specific problem to a generic framework, out of which comes a
generic solution requiring translation back to the specific. The process is
illustrated in Figure 1.</p>

</font>
<p align="left"><b>Figure 1: The General Model For TRIZ Problem Solving</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, with the exception of work on analogies
(Reference 1), the systemisation process effectively ends at the delivery of the
Generic Solutions. In the case of the Contradictions part of TRIZ, this means
the delivery of one or more of the 40 Inventive Principles. Although highly
valuable, many problem solvers still find there is a considerable gap between
these generic solution triggers and the desired specific solution. This gap is
illustrated in Figure 2.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ is being used successfully in a wide and widening
variety of fields. The space - this ‘gap’ - between Principles and design
solutions is obviously therefore not a vacuum. Whatever it is, however, is at
present obscured by clouds. The question is what is behind those clouds, and
whatever it is, is it in any way mappable?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.0 The Irreversible Nature of Good Ideas</p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b>The best if not only way of usefully looking beyond the
clouds is through examination of case study examples. Every successful patent
and every successful innovation offers potential data. There is thus an awful
lot of case study material from which to choose.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately there is a problem, and it is a fairly
fundamental problem associated with each and every case. It is a problem of
irreversibility:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving forwards from problem to solution - in effect the
process hidden behind the cloud - is a highly nebulous, highly intractable path.
Before that moment when the light-bulb finally lights, the engineer is often
literally as well as metaphorically in the dark.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other way around - looking back at the problem after the
solution has been discovered - however, is a completely different matter. Now
the solution is viewed as ‘obvious’, often to the point of being almost
facile. It’s the ‘why didn’t I think of that’ experience. In fact the
very ‘obviousness’ of a solution is very often used as a test of how ‘right’
the solution is. The more ‘obvious’ the answer, the better the solution.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image16.gif" width="395" height="290"></p>
</font>
<p align="left"><b>Figure 3: The Irreversible Nature Of Creative Ideas</b></p>
<b></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Think, for example, of how obvious a solution the wheel is.
Then think how non-obvious it was for the first 95% of human existence. Or think
how it is now taken for granted that a Benzene molecule takes the form of a
ring.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This ‘obviousness’ irreversibility and the speed with
which the light gets turned on once the switch is found makes it extremely
difficult to establish what the turning on process actually was. Most famously
with Kekule and his solution of the Benzene ring problem, the solution process
took the form of a dream about a snake chewing on its tail (Reference 2). It is
difficult to see how this might be a mappable process. Without direct access to
the problem solver - as was the case with TRIZ researchers looking at the patent
database - likely as not the problem will be even greater.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In trying to get ‘behind the cloud’, the irreversibility
problem can be expected to be a fairly major one.</p>
<b></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, however, let us have a look at a number of case
studies in order to gain a more specific feel for the size of the unknown behind
the cloud:-</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.0 Case Study 1: Flanged Joint</p>
</blockquote>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flange joints are used widely across a number of industry
sectors for joining adjacent sections of pipe or casings. In the aerospace
gas-turbine industry, flange joints are expected to seal high temperature, high
pressure gases at quite large diameters. A typical flange joint for the
powerplant in a large civil airliner may well require over a hundred bolts to
achieve adequate sealing performance. From the perspective of reducing weight
and improving maintainability of the engines, it is desirable to reduce the
number of bolts required. ‘Halving the number of bolts on a flange joint’
was a TRIZ case study described in Reference 3. The solution to the problem was
patented in the US as patent number 5,230,540 and is reproduced here in Figure
4.</p>

</font>
<p align="left"><b>Figure 4: Fluid-Tight Joint With Inclined Flange Face, US
Patent 5,230,540</b></p>
<font SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Inventive Principle used to derive this highly elegant
and simple solution was Inventive Principle 17, ‘Another Dimension’.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Case Study 1 then leaves us with ‘Another Dimension’ and
patent number 5,230,540 as the entry and exit points respectively of any process
that may exist behind the cloud.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>

  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.0 Case Study 2: Bicycle Seat</p>
  </blockquote>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bicycle seats are, generally speaking, uncomfortable things
to sit on. The bifurcated bicycle seat (Figure 5) is conceptually at least, a
means of achieving both comfortable sitting position and freedom to pedal.</p>
<i><font size="2"></font></i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image18.gif" width="299" height="211"></p>
</font>
<p align="left"><b>Figure 5: ABS Sports Bifurcated Saddle</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While not a new idea, the bifurcated seat does offer an
effective demonstration of the power of TRIZ and the Contradiction Matrix
(Reference 4).</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b>Case Study 2 sees the bifurcated bicycle seat as the
specific design solution emerging from simultaneous application of Inventive
Principle 15, ‘Dynamic Parts’.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.0 Case Study 3: Particle Separator</p>
</blockquote>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference 5 describes a more complex problem concerning a
novel design solution to the problem of particle separator systems for
helicopter engines.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of separator types available. Engine
mounted forms are probably the most common. All current engine mounted
separators look like the device illustrated in Figure 5; essentially an axi-symmetric,
bifurcated duct taking clean air around a sharp bend into the engine, and using
the inertia of contaminants to expel them through a scavenge duct.</p>
<i><font size="2"></font></i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image19.gif" width="600" height="410"></p>
</font>
<p align="left"><b>Figure 6: Typical Engine Mounted Particle Separator</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much effort has been expended trying to improve the
performance of these designs. Reference 5 describes the background to the
realisation of the novel solution shown in Figure 7. This new design offers the
potential to not only double contaminant separation efficiency, but also to
offer significant reductions in volume, weight, aerodynamic losses, and power
requirement.</p>

</font>
<p align="left"><b>Figure 7: US Patent 5,139,545 Particle Separator</b></p>
<b></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the improved design may be seen to be relatively simple
- the innovation comes about by simply transposing the position of the engine
and scavenge ducts - the process of deriving it was rather more complex. The
Inventive Principle used was Number 13 ‘The Other Way Around’.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.0 Mechanisms of Mind: Pattern Recognition</p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b>To solve the mystery of what lies behind the cloud in the
gap between generic and specific would be to solve a problem that has confounded
many hundreds of man-years of effort. To suggest that a solution exists here,
therefore, would be an action of extreme folly.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That being said, it is apparent that TRIZ has already done
much to de-mystify the creative process. Wonder, for example, whether Kekule
might have discovered the ring structure of Benzene any quicker if he had been
aware that there were Inventive Principles called ‘Merging’, or ‘Self-Service’,
or ‘Curvature Increase’? The Inventive Principles of TRIZ provide 40 very
good start points from which to search for problem solutions.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ provides a powerful foundation point. A pointer to how
the steps between Inventive Principle and design solution might then be plotted
perhaps comes from some of the research on how the human brain functions and,
particularly, on its pattern recognition capabilities.</p>
<i><font size="2"></font></i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By way of demonstration, and adapting the ‘Connect-Up’
idea first written about by Edward de Bono (6), if any two words are picked at
random, the brain will almost without fail manage to come up with another word
or collection of words that connects them. The process is often expressed in a
manner like that shown in Figure 8. Here the two chosen random words are DOG and
WING - at first glance neither word has anything at all to do with the other,
but the brain will almost inevitably make some kind of connection. Indeed, given
a couple of minutes, most people will be able to make associations with ten or
more connecting words.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image21.gif" width="500" height="96"></p>
</font>
<p align="left"><b>Figure 8: Connecting Words</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This pattern making capability is an undoubtedly powerful
one. Perhaps not so powerful, however, that some kind of mammoth artificial
intelligence computer-code might be constructed to mimic the process? Even with
only ten words connecting any pair and a typical individual’s word vocabulary,
though, mammoth would certainly be the word.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the situation becomes even more complicated if
a number of people are asked to perform the same exercise. Research in this
field (7) suggests that if ten people are asked to write down ten connecting
words each, the level of duplication of words between individuals would be very
small. On average, the number of duplicated words would be around 5%. In other
words, ten people writing down ten connecting words each would tend to produce a
total of over 90 different connecting words. <i>(Try it as an exercise sometime
and watch it happen.)</p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Knowing there to be a finite number of words, maybe some
people can still imagine this being a situation amenable to a software
implementation - albeit one in which we might hope the software itself does the
large majority of the ‘learning’/programming.</p>
<i><font size="2"></font></i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, even this scenario is a very long way away
from the full story. A very long way because given a series of pictorial images
to connect, one brain is usually capable of making even more connections. Take a
population of brains and the number of connections may well be as close to
infinite as makes any difference to even the biggest imaginable computer code.</p>

<p align="left"><img SRC="Image22.gif" width="500" height="96"></p>
</font>
<p align="left"><b>Figure 9: Case Study 3 Connections</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So what does this mean from the perspective of TRIZ and the
need to solve problems?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the positive side, it means that given a problem and an
Inventive Principle - for example the Case Study 3 scenario as re-drawn in
Connect-Up form (Figure 9) - the brain <b>will</b> make interesting connections.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Knowing the eventual solution to Case Study 3 and seeing this
picture, it is already extremely easy to see how the solution came about.
Recognising the Irreversibility phenomenon described in Section 2.0, perhaps it
is too easy to be believable? (The historical facts, however, show that the
gas-turbine industry collectively spent several tens of millions of dollars <b>not</b>
finding the solution.)</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same may be seen to apply to the other two Case Study
examples.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So what about another case study? One where the ‘answer’
may not previously been seen? Your turn to have a go!</p>

</font>
<p align="left"><b>Figure 10: Connecting Inventive Principle and Desired
Design Outcome</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The (an?) answer to this one can be found in Reference 8.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, even this example is over-simplistic.
Over-simplistic in two important ways:-</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1) There are 40 Inventive Principles. ‘Local Quality’
happened to be one that gave an excellent answer to this problem, but that was
not known a priori. In reality, there will have been at least three - and quite
possibly all 39 - other Inventive Principles to also try to connect.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2) More significantly, who is to say that the picture and its
corresponding problem definition (‘re-usable self-locking nut’) is either
the ‘right’ picture or the ‘right’ definition?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In other words, although it is possible to demonstrate that
the brain is able to make the right connections, the ‘Connect-Up’ idea is
still some considerable distance from being a systematic procedure.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.0 Use of System Operator</p>
  </blockquote>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference 9 discussed the connections between TRIZ and
mind-mapping in an idea generating context. Discussed then was the concept of
combined use of the generic solution triggers (in the case here, the Inventive
Principle ‘Local Quality’) and the need to think in TIME and SPACE. The
System Operator is seen to provide an excellent framework for focusing our
thinking when trying to make the connections we require between generic and
specific solution.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, in the case of the self-locking nut, in order to make
best use of the solution trigger ‘Local Quality’ we need to apply it not
just to the nut - the thing our brains would tell us to do! - but to the nut in
its bigger (super-system) and smaller (sub-system) contexts, and in terms of how
the nut’s behaviour and function changes with time. The thinking in space
context - and the idea of our viewing perspective continuously zooming in and
out - is particularly important with the Local Quality Principle.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to make most effective use of the Principle, we need
to be looking to apply it at each viewing perspective. In essence we are looking
for any element of the system where there is homogeneity. The presence of
homogeneity means the current solution has not used the ‘local quality’
Principle. In actual fact, therefore, anywhere we see homogeneity, Local Quality
is telling us we have a potential resource:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The nut has parallel, unbroken threaded surfaces -
    homogeneity and therefore a resource.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each thread is the same as the one next to it - more
    homogeneity</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The external sides of the nut are parallel and continuous
    - ditto</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And so on</li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The perspective shifting capabilities offered by the System
Operator, and the use of DeBono’s ‘connect-up’ idea in each of the 9
windows (e.g. ‘<i>what does Local Quality mean in the context of thread design
when the nut is being assembled?</i>’), offer potent ways of structuring
brainstorm sessions filling the gap between believing ‘Local Quality’ is a
good solution direction, and actually applying it to good effect on the problem.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether it will ever be possible for a piece of computer
software to automatically perform the actions necessary to achieve the answers
to any of the Case Study examples - or indeed <b>any generic</b> problem -
currently appears to be unlikely.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether or not it might be possible for <b>particular</b>
types or groups of problem, to be solved automatically, however, may be a
different matter.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recent work at the University of Bath on mechanism design
(10) may be one area where such a formal link between algorithms based on TRIZ
principles and automated mechanism design software (e.g. CAMFORD) may produce a
powerful design capability:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>The Beginnings of a Systematic Methodology? - </b>Mechanism
design is amenable to an automated design approach in areas where design rules
are able to be described in a logical, mathematical form.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bicycle seat example described in Case Study 2 may be
just such an example:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bicycle seat has a number of functional requirements
that, in the context of configuration design (as opposed to detail design), may
be expressed mathematically:-</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">range of positions at which the human frame is designed
    to carry seating loads,</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">range of loads at these positions,</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">range of torque (cornering) loads,</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">range of seat/bicycle connection positions,</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">range of relative positions between seat loading points
    and pedals,</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">range of leg movements associated with pedalling action,</li>

- the ‘how’ rules (e.g. ‘carry load using cantilever’) and <i>strategic
knowledge </i>- how the ‘how’ rules may be applied. In the ongoing automated

one in which the Inventive Principles of TRIZ are being projected. At least
those amenable to mathematical (software implementable) interpretation in the

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this regard, the current research philosophy, is pointing
