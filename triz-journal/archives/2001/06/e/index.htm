</b>
<p>Understanding the real needs of the customer is the central concern of
Quality Function Deployment (QFD). This paper investigates, how TRIZ could be
used to introduce structure into customer requirements. It relates TRIZ
concepts, like absent or available useful functions, harmful functions and
ideality, to the Kano model as given in Cohen’s book [1]. It gives a guideline
how to identify Kano’s 3 levels of qualities from TRIZ analysis of the
customer’s situation.</p>

<p><font FACE="Arial">Introduction</font></p>
</b>
<p>“I can’t sell my product successfully, when it does not satisfy my
customer. How to do that effectively?”</p>
<p>These simple words summarize the motivations for companies to take the
struggle of QFD. The QFD community continuously publishes success stories, how
mediocre products are converted into competitive products systematically.
According to QFD-practitioners cycle times can be reduced, customers can become
happier with the products and market shares can be increased.</p>
<p>Cohen reports many practical problems, which QFD-teams encounter in reality
to obtain customer focuses [1]. TRIZ provides means to describe and structure
complicated situations. TRIZ also provides ways to improve a difficult
situation. This paper investigates how TRIZ could be used to improve the quality
of QFD-input without changing QFD.</p>

</b>
<p>QFD-teams compile and structure customer requirements for products and
services. Functionality of existing products is compared and benchmarked from a
customer’s perspective. Successful QFD-teams manage to separate customer
requirements completely from specific technical solutions. They map the complex
relationships between requirements and various design aspects in QFD-matrices.</p>
<p>This process improves understanding of success factors and documents customer
oriented market research. It can create very concise and comprehensive
information, which can help to continuously decide in favor of the customer
throughout design, manufacturing and sales.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">QFD-Tools</font></p>
</b>
<p>Bob King has compiled a plethora of QFD-matrices used [2]. It depends on the
situation which matrix is the best to start with. The most frequently used QFD-matrix
is the A1-matrix, which maps “customer demands” with “quality
characteristics of the product”. It has become famous as “the house of
quality” due to its graphical representation.</p>
<p>To the author’s experience it can be easier to start with the A2-matrix,
which maps “product-functions” with “quality characteristics of the
product”. It seems to be easier to talk about what products shall or shall not
do. Once clustered the functional requirements (rows) can establish an
appropriate metrics of “required quality characteristics of the product”
(columns). Using this metrics as input (columns) for the A1-matrix can help to
identify relevant “customer requirements” (rows) more easily. Starting with
the A2-matrix allows also engaging TRIZniks who are strong in analyzing
functions of a system.</p>
<p>Before entering information into QFD-matrices the information must be
structured to avoid excessive growth of a QFD-matrix. Bob King provides many
techniques, which are widely used today [2]. Glenn Mazur proposes “Voice of
Customer Analysis” to structure the process of gaining relevant knowledge on
the customer’s real needs [3].</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">Focus on Customer</font></p>
</b>
<p>Glenn Mazur emphases to focus on customer, not on the product. He states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Nothing Wrong <font FACE="Symbol">¹</font> Anything Right [3]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">to indicate the inherent short comings of many design
processes. A product that does not perform wrong is not necessarily a product
that is “right for the customer”. Absence of failures is no guarantee for
success in the market place.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He suggests that a supplier should go to the gemba <img SRC="Image26.gif" WIDTH="46" HEIGHT="30">,
just like Japanese companies do. “Gem” means “current, present”, “Ba”
means “location or place”. Gemba is the <i>true</i> source of information.
It is the place and time, where the product is actually used by the customer and
creates value for the customer [3].</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In brief, he suggests to “walk a mile with the customer”
and to observe what he/she is doing with the product, what kind of problems
occur, what he/she says and not says. While visiting the gemba the main
objective of the supplier should be to perceive the unspoken. Evaluating and
structuring these observations gives the supplier the opportunity to identify
expressed and hidden needs for different customer-groups.</p>
<b>
<p><font FACE="Arial">Kano’s Model of Customer Requirements</font></p>
</b>
<p>Customer requirements can be invisible to both the customer and the supplier.
Noriaki Kano proposed using a simple model to better understand customer needs.
He compares the degree of fulfillment of requirements by the supplier with the
degree of satisfaction by the customer. It is very useful to keep this model in
mind when visiting the gemba.</p>
<p>Kano distinguishes 3 categories of customer requirements (Figure 1) [1, 4]:</p>
  <b>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Expected requirements</b> are “self-evident” and unspoken. E.g. one can
  expect that a car will drive and can stop. Even a 100% fulfillment of these
  aspects will never satisfy a customer. On the contrary, when these
  requirements are absent or exhibit a failure, customers will be dissatisfied.
  Kano calls them <b>dissatisfiers</b>.</li>
  <b>
  <li>Revealed requirements</b> are expressed in one way or the other. They are
  not hidden. The degree of fulfillment is highly correlated with customer
  satisfaction, like asking for a specific interior of a car. Kano calls them <b>satisfiers</b>.</li>
  <b>
  <li>Exciting requirements</b> are not expected and are not asked for. However,
  should they be available by the product, customer can become very excited,
  like having a GPS-system in a standard car at no extra cost. Kano calls them <b>delighters</b>.</li>
</ul>

<b>
<p><font FACE="Arial">Ambiguities of Customer Requirements and Product Functions</font></p>
</b>
<p>What may be exciting for one customer may be an expected quality for another.
What a customer wants to achieve by using the product can deviate significantly
from the design intention of the product. A customer-oriented formulation of
product functions needs to be worked out.</p>
<u>
<p>Example:</p>
</u>
<p>The primary useful function (PUF) of a woolen facemask is <b>to protect</b>
(skin against cold weather conditions). A motorcyclist desires to wear a
facemask during cold seasons. The supplier of the facemask can improve the PUF <b>to
protect</b> by providing a better thermal insulation. The facemask keeps the
face of the motorcyclist warmer, who may be delighted.</p>
<p>A bank robber may be very dissatisfied with a high-thermal-insulating
facemask. During robbery in a warm bank the robber may need to lift the mask,
showing his/her face. The bank robber needs another PUF: <b>to</b> <b>hide</b>
(face).</p>
<p>The facemask provides both properties <b>to protect</b> AND <b>to hide</b>.
The same product can have several different primary useful functions depending
on the different objectives of different customers. Knowing about the objectives
of a specific group of customers is important to identify the correct PUF and to
improve the right product functions by QFD or TRIZ.</p>
<b>
<p><font FACE="Arial">Details on Kano’s Qualities and Relationship to TRIZ</font></p>
</b>
<p>Chapter 2.8 of reference [1] provides many interesting details on Kano’s
qualities.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">Dissatisfiers</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </b>
  <p>“Dissatisfiers are the absence of ‘expected quality’, in the sense
  that customers expect products to be essentially flawless, and if they are
  not, the customers are dissatisfied. Examples of dissatisfiers are scratches
  or blemishes on the surface of a product, broken parts, missing instruction
  booklets, or missing features that are routinely supplied in similar products.
  Customers don’t tell us they want ‘expected quality’ because they take
  for granted we will provide it.”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>From a TRIZ-perspective Cohen talks about:</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>missing Useful Action</li>
    <li>available Harmful Action</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A “QFD by TRIZ”-process should reveal the primary useful functions of a
product, from a customer’s perspective. By applying TRIZ-functional models the
situation can be significantly clarified, as indicated in later chapters of this
paper. Very powerful tools to reveal Harmful Actions are the sabotage- [5] or
the more refined AFD-technique [6].</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">Satisfiers</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </b>
  <p>“A satisfier is something that customers want in their products, and
  usually ask for. The more we provide a satisfier, the happier customers will
  be. (…) Examples of satisfiers are increased capacity, lower cost, higher
  reliability (…) In other words, you can expect the satisfiers to be present
  in all the competitive products, to a greater or lesser extent.”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Very clearly from a TRIZ-perspective Cohen talks about:</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>available Useful Action</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">Delighters</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </b>
  <p>“Delighters are product attributes or features that are pleasant
  surprises to customers when they first encounter them. (…) A typical
  customer reaction to a delighter is to say to a friend, ‘Hey, take a look at
  this!’</p>
  <p>(…) The 3M Post-it Note is another example of a delighter. It’s a
  product that filled user needs that had not been filled satisfactorily.</p>
  <p>(…) The needs that delighters fill are often called ‘latent’ or ‘hidden’
  needs (…) These needs are sometimes intimately linked to customer’s
  perceptions of the limits of technology (…)”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>From TRIZ-perspective delighters seem to be related to:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    </p><ul>
      <li>insufficient Useful Action</li>
      <li>limitations = trade-offs = physical conflicts</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">Observations</font></p>
</b>
<p>Overall, eliminating dissatisfiers (introducing sufficient Useful Action,
eliminating Harmful Action), strengthening satisfiers and introducing delighters
(introducing sufficient Useful Action, eliminating conflicts) will increase the <b>Ideality</b>
of a product or service.</p>
<p>The author’s perception of the situation is summarized in the Table 1. As
will be shown later, Dissatisfiers and Delighters differ by their impact on
customer’s value (cf. Figure 2).</p>
<p>There is a partial overlap to Steve Ungvari’s paper [7]. During the
recherché phase for this paper the author found an interesting paper from Ellen
Domb, which also compares QFD and TRIZ [8]. She indicates, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Functional- and Resource Analysis, as known from TRIZ, are important
      for QFD</li>
      <li>TRIZ can be used to identify and resolve conflicts during analysis of
      the “Voice of the Customer”</li>
      <li>Visiting the Gemba is a good chance to understanding contradictions and
      use of resources.</li>
    </ul>
    </blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">Practical Aspects</font></p>
</b>
<p>For practical purposes Table 1 can be used to identify Kano’s qualities in
a more objective way:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Identify objectives of your customer</li>
      <li>Understand the role of your product for your customer</li>
      <li>Understand how your product impacts your customer’s Perceived
      Ideality</li>
      <li>Model the Gemba of your customer (UA, HA)</li>
      <li>Identify dissatisfiers, satisfiers, delighters, hidden needs with Table
      1</li>
    </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<b>
<p><font FACE="Arial">Obvious Ideality and Perceived Ideality</font></p>
</b>
<p>According to TRIZ the Ideality of a product will increase inevitably during
the evolution of the product.</p>
<p>Many products have been designed for a dedicated purpose. For example a car
is designed to drive, a printer is designed to print or a computer is designed
to compute. The product’s name itself already indicates a specific, obvious
primary useful function. Improving these obvious functions leads to an increase
in <b>Obvious Ideality</b>.</p>
<p>When planning and deploying a product in a customer oriented way we have to
account for perceived functions of the product. Improving these will increase
the <b>Perceived Ideality</b> of the product. Perceived Ideality will be
different for different customers. Perceived Ideality can deviate significantly
from Obvious Ideality.</p>
<p>Why does a customer use a specific product?</p>
<p>Initially the customer has a specific objective in mind. The customer selects
a product, which provides a function to achieve the objective. Achieving the
objective creates a specific value for the customer, which is very satisfying.</p>
<b>
<p><font FACE="Arial">Minimum Requirements on a Kano related TRIZ-Model</font></p>
</b>
<p>A TRIZ- model of Useful and Harmful Functions of a product should at least
indicate 3 types of actions, so that Kano’s qualities can be identified via
Table 1:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Product functions from the customer’s perspective (useful, harmful,
      insufficient, conflicting)</li>
      <li>Customer’s objective(s) (expected, unexpected)</li>
      <li>Value created for the customer (expected, unexpected)</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It should reveal the mechanisms of value creation for the customer. Further
resources and fields available to the customer can be included, which helps to
understand the observations made at the gemba.</p>
<p>The Problem Formulator of Ideation’s software “IWB2000” [9] is used to
show the minimum cause-effect relationships required identifying Kano’s
qualities (Figure 2). (Green) Boxes indicate useful functions, while (red) boxes
with rounded corners indicate harmful actions. Arrows indicate a “produce”
effect, while crossed arrows indicate a “counteract” effect.</p>
<p>A functional model of the customer’s situation should look similar to
Figure 2 and should allow applying Table 1.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>

</b>
<p align="left"><font FACE="Arial"><img SRC="Image28.gif" width="557" height="458"></font></p>
<b><font SIZE="2">
</font></b>
<p>The author assumes that the creation of expected value results in
satisfaction of the customer, while the creation of unexpected value leads the
customer to being delighted. The harmful actions, indicated in Figure 2,
counteract achieving the customer’s objectives. As a result the customer will
be dissatisfied.</p>
<p>In reality a delighting function will also be subjected to dissatisfiers or
hidden needs. It looks like Kano’s delighters are strongly related to what the
customer thinks is feasible.</p>

</font><b>
<p><font FACE="Arial">Improving the Kano-Situation</font></p>
</b>
<p>In the previous chapters the author showed, how the customer’s situation
could be modeled by TRIZ from a QFD-perspective. We now can go one step further
and investigate, how the Kano-situation could be improved.</p>
<p>Activating the Diagram/Formulate-menu of the IWB2000 gives 11 directions of
innovation for the model in Figure 2:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>#1. Find an alternative way to obtain [the] (achieve objective) that
    offers the following: provides or enhances [the] (create expected value),
    does not require [the] (use an expected UA /satisfier/), is not influenced
    by [the] (encounter a HA /dissatisfier/), (encounter a missing UA /dissatisfier/)
    and (encounter limiting conflicts /hidden need/).</p>
    <p>#2. Find an alternative way to obtain [the] (create expected value) that
    does not require [the] (achieve objective).</p>
    <p>#3. Consider transitioning to the next generation of the system that will
    provide [the] (create expected value) in a more effective way and/or will be
    free of existing problems.</p>
    <p>#4. Find an alternative way to obtain [the] (use an expected UA
    /satisfier/) that provides or enhances [the] (achieve objective).</p>
    <p>#5. Find a way to eliminate, reduce, or prevent [the] (encounter a HA /dissatisfier/).</p>
    <p>#6. Find a way to eliminate, reduce, or prevent [the] (encounter a
    missing UA /dissatisfier/).</p>
    <p>#7. Find an alternative way to obtain [the] (achieve more than expected)
    that offers the following: provides or enhances [the] (create unexpected
    value), does not require [the] (use a sufficient or insufficient UA
    /delighter/).</p>
    <p>#8. Find an alternative way to obtain [the] (use a sufficient or
    insufficient UA /delighter/) that provides or enhances [the] (achieve more
    than expected).</p>
    <p>#9. Find a way to eliminate, reduce, or prevent [the] (encounter limiting
    conflicts /hidden need/).</p>
    <p>#10. Find an alternative way to obtain [the] (create unexpected value)
    that does not require [the] (achieve more than expected).</p>
    <p>#11. Consider transitioning to the next generation of the system that

<p>Successful QFD-teams may know many of these proposed strategies. These
proposals can be used to choose an appropriate starting point for a QFD.
Proposal #2, #3, #7, #10, #11 focus on value creation regardless of the product.
The may be interesting for highly innovative market strategies. A
semi-hypothetical case study will elucidate these options.</p>

</b>
<p>Over the last 15 years the author used different generations of desktop
printers. This example is used to better understand the development of QFD-requirements
in time.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    </p><ul>
      <li>When starting at Philips Semiconductors the LA50 printer was widely
      used. In the beginning it was used as a shared printer. When these
      printers were replaced by laser printers they occasionally served as
      office printer.</li>
      <li>In the beginning 90’s the author bought a private high quality
      printer NEC 24P. At that time he needed printouts from source codes
      frequently. He wanted to use a low-noise device so that his little sun
      could continue to sleep.</li>
      <li>In the mid 90’s he upgraded to a LED-printer from Panasonic, which
      was faster, less noisy and had a much better image quality.</li>
      <li>In the late 90’s hp’s Inkjet was introduced. The author finally
      used it as a trade-off solution with respect to the harmful effects from
      the LED-printer.</li>

visualized by a simplified estimate of the printer’s Perceived Ideality

<p><font FACE="Arial">A potential Trap for Suppliers: Improving the Obvious
Ideality of the Printer itself</font></p>
</b>
<p>When being asked to improve his/her printer, a supplier may focus on the
obvious thing to do: improve the printer itself. While this might happen
inevitably in the evolution of the printer, it may not be exactly what the
customer wants.</p>
<p>There are many ways to utilize TRIZ for this purpose. A free-style TRIZ
approach is sketched here. The supplier can formulate the primary useful
function (PUF) of the printer. Next, he/she can envision the Ideal Printer and
find an approximating device, which may be build:</p>

<p>The exact <b>Obvious-Ideal-Printer</b> may be difficult to envision. An
approximation of this<b> Obvious-Ideal-Printer </b>(no bulky printer, just its
output) can become a reality today. IBM and MIT recently announced prototypes of
the e-book, where sheets of electronic paper are bundled into a book [10, 11].</p>
<p>The desired e-paper might be based on this concept. Instead of passing paper
through a printer, a pile of e-paper could be modified by electronic data,
forming a pile of persistent, individual printouts. The ‘printed’ pile of
e-paper could than be used and handled exactly like ordinary paper (e.g.
punching, binding, writing notes on it).</p>
<p>When the supplier wants to understand the mechanisms of dissatisfiers AFD may
be a valuable TRIZ-tool to apply for this purpose:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>How to deteriorate the PUF? -&gt; AFD-analysis -&gt; it is important to
    understand the mechanism of the PUF and how to deteriorate it by the
    available resources.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to produce the printout the e-paper must be modified in some way. In
order to provide interaction with electronic data a receiver must receive data
from an appropriate data-channel and must pass it to the e-paper in a suitable
internal format.</p>
<p>TOP-analysis from Zinovy Royzen is used to derive a simplified functional
model [12].</p>

<p>The supplier might formulate a business plan from these considerations, start
development and, later on, sales. The self-printing e-paper will certainly be a
very innovative product, which will find its market. However, this product might
not create the best value for the customer.</p>
<b>
<p><font FACE="Arial">Improving Perceived Ideality of a customer</font></p>
</b>
<p>The author assumes he represents a reasonable market-segment of programmers
in this example. A detailed market research activity might have revealed the
following situation, <b><u>why</u></b> this printer creates value for these
customers (Figure 4).</p>

<font SIZE="2">
</font>
<p>The reason to use the printer is to develop a „functional program with less
bugs“, which is a value for this customer. The customer expects to achieve
this result by frequently reviews of printouts. Because printing turned out to
occur at low noise, printouts can be created at any day time. This allows to
start more complex projects, which fits the long term perspective of this
customer in this market-segment. However, unexpected emission of ozone limit
these capabilities.</p>
<p>The supplier can initiate 3 types of QFD’s in order to capture the „voice
of the customer“:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    </p><ul>
      <li>QFD based on product functions</li>

<p>This matrix reflects the customer demand (left), relevant measurement
characteristics (top), global interaction between these (symbols) and relevance
to the customer (right). The weighted importance (bottom) can help the
development team to spend their development resources in a way which will
guarantee meeting relevant customer objectives. In this example it would be
important to focus on improvement in speed first and noise levels next.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that TRIZ can go one step further here. The IWB2000
suggests 3 directions to improve the functions of the printer functions:</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Find an alternative way to obtain [the] (faster, high quality printing
    /satisfier/) that provides or enhances [the] (review source code).</li>
    <li>Find a way to eliminate, reduce, or prevent [the] (emit ozone /dissatisfier/).</li>
    <li>Find an alternative way to obtain [the] (low noise printing
    /delighter/) that provides or enhances [the] (start more complex projects).</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The objectives of the customer are included in proposal #1 and #3. Thus they
could be included as further quality characteristics in column „other
characteristics“ or as design alternatives in QFD-matrix E1 (Pugh concept
selection [2]).</p>

</font>
<p>QFD based on Customer’s Objectives:</p>
</u>
<p>The middle part of Figure 4 is utilized now as customer requirements (Table
4). Customer demands are different now and the quality characteristics have been
adapted. Further considerations are the same as made for Table 3. Some quality
characteristics from the previous QFD might still be useful, like „Printer
speed“.</p>

<p>The directions of innovation now give non-product related proposals, which
may be hard to implement by the printer itself:</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Find an alternative way to obtain [the] (review source code) that
    offers the following: provides or enhances [the] (functional program with
    less bugs), does not require [the] (faster, high quality printing
    /satisfier/), is not influenced by [the] (emit ozone /dissatisfier/).</li>
    <li>Find an alternative way to obtain [the] (start more complex projects)

    high functionality), does not require [the] (low noise printing
    /delighter/), is not influenced by [the] (emit ozone /dissatisfier/).</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead these proposals can guide the supplier to consider entering the
completely different market of software engineering or to supply the printer
with additional benefits. For example, the supplier could provide a booklet with
the printer, how to avoid bugs while concepting and writing programs. The
booklet might help the customer reducing the need to print out frequently for
check purposes. Being a design alterntive such ideas will probably be handled by
QFD matrix E1 (Pugh concept selection [2]).</p>

<p>The right part of Figure 4 is utilized now as customer requirements (Table
5). Characteristics from the previous QFD’s may appear here as well, like „Printer
speed“ and „Review frequency“. However, due to the different directions
aimed at they will probably end up with a very low weighted importance rating.
This would be a typical QFD-result and these aspects will probably be excluded
from further considerations.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">Remarks</font></p>

<p>In reality the author made a decision, which matches the QFD based on
customer’s values. He switched from a Windows-based software development
environment, which required using a very inconvenient, complex and
hard-to-understand library, to a Linux based software environment with Perl and
Perl/Tk. His development rate of complex programs increased considerably,
demanding for less individual printouts.</p>

<p><font FACE="Arial">Anticipating the Voice of the Customer</font></p>
</b>
<p>Visiting the gemba will probably still be necessary today, as Glenn Mazur
proposes [3]. It may be the only means to begin understanding the customer’s
needs. In TRIZ terms visiting the gemba will reveal fields and resources
available to the customer and hidden to the supplier.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to investigate to which degree an</p>
<blockquote>

    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>methodology can be established. AFD, as known within the TRIZ-community, may
be suited as a starting point for this purpose.</p>
<p>AFD allows predicting failures of a system. A main step in this process is to
reveal all flows within the system because it has been found that failures tend
to occur at high concentrations of flows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Flow of energy</li>
      <li>Flow of information</li>
      <li>Flow of substances.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Then it is investigated, which degrees of freedom are available within the
system to create failures (= unwanted results) [6].</p>
<p>In the facemask example above we encounter a similar situation. It is
interesting to understand how the product can be used for different purposes.
Different customers utilize different properties of the product, facemask. More
precisely, they utilize different flows, e.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Flow of heat (motor cyclist)</li>
      <li>Flow of light (bank robber)</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>These flows could be generalized to identify potential market segments for
the product. E.g. the heat flow related market segment could also include
joggers, skywalks, mountain climbers etc. The light flow related market segment
could also include swat teams, theater groups etc. However, following these
routes will lead to increasing Obvious Ideality, only. Objectives and values
remain hidden.</p>
<p>Products, increasing the Obvious Idealities, might be:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Transparent, heating facemasks</li>
      <li>Absorbing, cooling facemasks</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>More investigations will be necessary to derive truly ACO- or ACV-methods,
which allow improving Perceived Idealities. These methods should make visiting
the gemba completely obsolete, while allowing to achieve the same or a better
QFD-result.</p>

<p><font FACE="Arial">Conclusions</font></p>
</b>
<p>Modeling different aspects of QFD by TRIZ models was an interesting
experience in itself.</p>
<p>TRIZ can be used to introduce structure into customer requirements. When the
mechanism of value creation for the customer is modeled by TRIZ it becomes
possible to derive Kano’s satisfiers, dissatisfiers and delighters. The TRIZ
model of this mechanism can be used to create 3 different kinds of QFD’s:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    </p><ul>
      <li>QFD’s based on product functions</li>
      <li>QFD’s based on customer’s objectives</li>
      <li>QFD’s based on customer’s values</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>in a systematic way. They indicate very interesting marketing strategies.</p>
<p>The author finds it more accurate to replace the TRIZ term “Ideality” by
the terms “Obvious Ideality” and “Perceived Ideality” in a QFD context.</p>
<p>It should be further investigated if a method to anticipate customer’s
objectives (ACO) and a method to anticipate customer’s values (ACV) could be
developed by TRIZ.</p>

</b>
<p>Michael Schlueter graduated in low-energy solid-state physics in 1987 at the
Christian-Albrechts-Universitaet, Kiel. He visited CERN in 1984 as a summer
student and other high energy physics facilities to witness front-end research.
He started at Philips Semiconductors, Hamburg in 1986 and held various
support-related positions for IC-development. Very early he started evaluating
methods for quality improvement. He began with TRIZ in 1996, after following a
presentation of Zinovy Royzen at the Taguchi Symposium in Los Angeles. He tried
many contemporary approaches to TRIZ and is an active promoter of TRIZ within
Philips.</p>

</b>
<p>Symbols are used in QFD to indicate strong, average and weak relationships
between rows and columns. Each symbol is associated with a rating value. Most
frequently symbols and ratings are chosen as:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><font FACE="Wingdings">¤</font> strong relationship, rating *9<br>
    <font FACE="Wingdings">¡</font> average relationship, rating *3<br>
    <font FACE="Symbol">D</font> weak relationship, rating *1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Customer’s importance ratings are usually indicated on a scale from 1 (not
important) to 5 (very important).</p>

<p>An overall weighted-importance is calculated for the quality characteristics,
which accounts for the importance of customer requirements and the relationships
between needs and technical characteristics. E.g. “printer speed” yields 58
as weighted-importance in the example:</p>
<p>9*5 + 3*3 + 1*4 = 58</p>
