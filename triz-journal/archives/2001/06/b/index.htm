<p align="left"><b><font size="2">Introduction</font></b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1973, after I graduated from the Public Institute of
Inventive Creativity (PIIC or its Russian acronym is AzOIIT) I had such a strong
desire to share my TRIZ (the Russian acronym for Theory of Inventive Problem
Solving) knowledge with my compatriots, because what I had learned from Mr.
Altshuller had been so useful in my life.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1977, with encouragement from Mr. Altshuller - the founder
of TRIZ, my experiences with him and the experiences based on my use of TRIZ in
my work and daily life I created the adapted program entitled “Creativity
Methodologies” and conducted it as an extra-curricular course for students
from differing departments of HoChiMinh City University. I wrote the “adapted
program” because in order to introduce into and disseminate TRIZ widely in
Vietnam, in the first place, I should take into account Vietnam’s cultural,
social, economic, scientific and technological conditions. This adaptation,
shortly after that, was turned into a process of enlarging TRIZ to be taught not
only for engineers but for the large public. In this regard, it is necessary to
say a little about the reason for such a change.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">H. G. Wells remarked, “Human history becomes more and more
a race between education and catastrophe”. As a teacher in education I am
keenly aware of this challenge and, of course, I would like to contribute as
much as possible to the victory of education. But what does education do to beat
catastrophe?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many definitions of human beings, one of them is
that human beings are thinking creatures. But from possessing thinking ability
to knowing how to think well is a long distance. Many writers suppose that a
great number of tragedies at personal, group, even national and global levels
have deep causes through inadequate thinking skills for solving related
problems.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A long time ago, Charles Darwin suggested, “The highest
possible stage in moral culture is when we recognize that we ought to control
our thoughts”. But in practice, as Mr. Altshuller indicated in his famous book
Creativity as an Exact Science, “Any idea of controlling something that is not
yet controlled today is received calmly. We will find means of controlling it,
we shall control it. Yet only the idea of controlling the process of creativity
as a rule encounters hefty resistance”. In spite of that , he has created TRIZ,
“The new technology of creativity, in which the process of thinking is not
chaotic but organized and plainly subject to control”.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, many educators including myself have shared the
thought of Jim Killian, the former president of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, “The basic aim of education is not to accumulate knowledge, but
rather to learn to think creatively, teach oneself and seek answers to questions
as yet unexplored”. In my turn, I would like to add, “And put creative ideas
into action”.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Initially, TRIZ was aimed first of all at engineers. Later
on, Mr. Altshuller in his speeches, articles and books time and again stressed
the possibility and necessity for enlarging TRIZ to other non-engineering
fields, that is, for creating the general theory of creative problem solving in
any area of human activity.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the basis of our own experiences in using TRIZ for solving
different kinds of problems and teaching TRIZ for the large public irrespective
of age, profession and position for more than 25 years we believe that TRIZ
itself, in all senses can be the core of such a theory. In our vision, TRIZ-based
general theory of creative problem solving will help education to beat
catastrophe. Writing on this point, I remember William Drummond’s observation.
“He who will not reason is a bigot; he who cannot is a fool; he who dares not
is a slave” and want to add in TRIZ spirit “He/she who knows how to think
and act for solving the problems encountered during his/her life in a scientific
way is a free and happy man/woman”.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This paper gives a brief review on some ideas and results
associated with enlarging TRIZ and teaching enlarged TRIZ for the large public
at our Center for Scientific and Technical Creativity (CSTC) belonging to
Vietnam National University - HoChiMinh City College of Natural Sciences.</p>

<ol type="I">
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Enlarging TRIZ and Teaching Enlarged TRIZ for the Large
Public: Requirements, Rules and Resources.</font></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our view, the efforts for enlarging TRIZ and teaching
enlarged TRIZ for the large public should be made according to the following
requirements, rules and resources:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To fulfil Mr.
Altshuller’s humane ideal as he wrote, “People have equal right to happiness
and this right includes, first of all, the right to creativity, the right to the
development of related abilities for creativity... Everyone must be literate in
creativity”.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For this aim, TRIZ must
be enlarged toward eradicating “the illiteracy in creativity” in general, so
that enlarged TRIZ can help the general populous to solve problems in all
aspects of their daily lives in the scientific way like TRIZ solving problems in
technological fields.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For a long time,
research work should aim at managing creative thinking in the process of problem
solving and create a full set of appropriate tools (in the largest meaning) to
cope with the variety of people's lives and the world. To that end, enlarged
TRIZ should be a further development of constructing the kind of creative
thinking which is dialectical systems thinking and directed by the objective
laws of systems development in accordance with the inherent features of TRIZ.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ has its own great
intrinsic resources that can be used for self-enlargement. For example, in TRIZ
there are many points whose meanings may be explained or interpreted much more
largely so that TRIZ philosophy and/or spirit might be used in any sphere of
human activity, not only in technological fields. Moreover, from the view of
systems hierarchy, Mr. Altshuller considers forty basic creativity principles
analogous to chemical elements and creativity methods analogous to chemical
compounds (results of various combinations of chemical elements). The real
world, which is infinitely diverse at an atomic level of the systems hierarchy
consists of more than a hundred chemical elements. If we take into account not
only forty principles but subprinciples with their implications, I am sure that
the obtained quantity is much more than a hundred. Imagine what a diverse world
of creativity tools we can create. In this connection, I believe that the other
(non-TRIZ) creativity methods are only special cases of TRIZ.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ has been
constructed relying on a lot of sources (see Figure 1). Among them there are
sciences having a high degree of generalization (e.g. dialectics, systems
theory, cybernetics, information theory). This means that these sciences have a
very large area of application. So, their current knowledge and new findings in
the future can facilitate effectively the process of enlarging TRIZ on the path
to creation of the general theory of creative problem solving.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><sup><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><img SRC="Image1.gif" width="469" height="682"></font></sup></p>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two sides of
human creativity: subjective (psychological) and objective. According to TRIZ,
the essence of the issue is that only the person who grasps the objective laws
of systems development and manages his/ her psychology along them can achieve a
high efficiency in creativity.</p>
</blockquote>
<sup><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
</font>

</sup>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is obvious that this management will be better if the
person knows how his/ her psychological factors work. So, teaching of enlarged
TRIZ needs to be supplemented by more knowledge of cognitive psychology.</p>
<ol start="7">
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patent information
which on its merits is information about inventive creativity (or development of
inventions) has helped research work in order to reveal the objective
development laws of technological systems. But one drop of sea water may reflect
the taste of the whole sea. Then, on the one hand there are possibilities to
transpose application of the objective laws of systems development, ideas, the
way we reason and tools in TRIZ to other non-technological areas, and on the
other hand you may present enlarged TRIZ with countless illustrations taken from
non-technological areas. It is possible because development of all kinds of
systems obey the similar, analogical or isomorphic laws.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to Mr.
Altshuller, especially when tackling inventive problems of the highest levels, a
solver has to have a knowledge of the whole of technology, the whole of physics,
the whole of chemistry. To meet this demand, the booklets “Guiding the Usage
of Physical/ Chemical/ Geometrical Effects in Inventing” were born. In our
view existing “Guidings” are inadequate, primitive and not convenient to
use. Given this, I think, there will be very large room for future research work
in that direction.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In enlarging TRIZ, Mr.
Altshuller’s working style should be strictly followed, that is, every
enlargement in TRIZ should be verified, corrected and perfected through a
feedback established with the development information in general and patent
information in particular, and the results of use of learners during and after
the teaching process.<br>
    <br>
    Luckily, in comparison with our ancestors, now we have a very
great amount of information about many kinds of evolution and development in
biology, society, cosmology, scientific and technological knowledge and so
forth. If before, this information to great extent has been processed
fragmentarily in accordance with specialized fields, then now, we should
reprocess all information about reality from the angle of development. In such a
way, because of unity of reality we can reveal the most generalized laws of
development or at least, isomorphic, similar or analogical laws of development
which can serve as a directing mechanism in creative thinking (thinking for
problem solving and decision making).</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In principle, the large
public must be understood as all people without any exception. In practice, up
to now we have concentrated our efforts on people with high and higher education
irrespective of age, profession and position.<br>
    <br>
    In our view, enlarged TRIZ is able to be fully adapted for
people with lower education.</li>
  <li>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Like other sciences,
during its evolution and development TRIZ can be enlarged toward specialization
on stages of a process of conducting creativity and innovation, and on
theoretical and applied issues.</p>

</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our program “Creativity Methodologies” based on TRIZ has
the aim of providing the large public (not only engineers) with knowledge and
tools which help them solve creatively and innovatively in a scientific way
problems (not only technological ones whose solutions must be patentable) they
may encounter during their lives. The following are some results derived from
the process of accomplishing this aim.</p>

  TRIZ.</b></li>
  </ol>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is known that every discipline has its basic concepts and
their definitions help people to have a common language which is useful in
thinking, communication and action. With time, the term that is a form of
expression of the given concept can remain the same but its content may be
changed and enriched with many new meanings (implications). It is one of the
ways to enlarge an application of concepts. Thus, we have made a real attempt to
do that for basic concepts used in TRIZ. The following are definitions with
explanations involved in some of these concepts.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>Creativity</u> is an activity leading to anything (in the
largest meaning) having both newness and usefulness simultaneously.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many implications relating to how to understand
this definition. For example:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The human activity is
only one of possible activities in the universe.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the given field,
newness is any sign of difference from any previously known object (called a
prototype object or shortly, prototype). To reveal newness we should first
choose a prototype, then compare the object after improvement with the chosen
prototype.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the above definition
of creativity the emphasis is made on “simultaneously” because any newness
brings about usefulness only inside its specific region of application.
So the given newness being applied outside its region of application can bring
about harm. In this meaning, any creation can be a double-edged sword.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Creativity creates
development and in every development there is creativity. So, searching for
creativity laws in creativity science is searching for development laws. In this
connection, the patent information is only one of possible information sources
about development.</li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our activities originate from and meet our needs. In search
of ways to meet our needs, we may encounter or set problems to solve.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>A problem</u> is a situation where a solver knows the aim (in
the largest meaning) but</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>does not know any way to reach it or</li>
  <li>does not know the optimum way to reach it among known ways to
        reach it (i.e. decision making process).</li>
</ol>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problems differ in difficulty levels. For example, TRIZ
divided the difficulty of technological problems (or the inventive creativity)
into five levels. If we take also all other problems into consideration, it is
apparent that human life is a succession of problems to be solved and decisions
to be made. Life will be happy if all problems in general (not only
technological problems) can be solved well. In the opposite case, life will be
“the sea of torments”. TRIZ needs to be enlarged toward helping ordinary
people to solve well all the problems which they may face in their work and
life. If TRIZ could do so, their lives would be “ the sea of happiness”. In
our view, TRIZ has a great capacity for that.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Basically, a human being has to think really and actively
when he/she has a problem to solve.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>Creative thinking</u> is the thought process leading the
solver from not knowing to</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>knowing the way to reach his/ her aim or</li>
  <li>knowing the optimum way to reach his/ her aim among known ways.</li>
</ol>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We call this thought process creative thinking of the solver
because there are both newness: from “not knowing” to “knowing” and
usefulness: at last the desired aim is reached and both ends are found by the
solver’s own thinking efforts. In fact, creative thinking is the thinking
process of solving problems and making decisions.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After getting the solution in the form of an idea to the
given problem, the next step for the solver is to realize it in places where
this idea is needed. In other words, in addition to thinking, actions need to be
performed to ensure that the solution becomes real and accepted.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>Innovation</u> is a process of thinking up creative ideas and
implementing them so that all changes as results of this process are fully,
stably and sustainably accepted by the related systems which after that function
better than before.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A crude innovative process can be represented by Figure 2.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our opinion, the problem can be considered as successfully
solved only when its solution has been accepted fully, stably and sustainably,
at last, by the system of potential users in practice (full or complete
innovation). Then, newness becomes oldness and usefulness becomes real, and only
in such a case we will have a genuine development in reality. In other words,
what we need is not creativity for the sake of creativity but for the sake of
the problem being solved successfully in reality, that is, for the sake of full
(complete) innovation. Because “the end of fishing is not angling but catching”
and I want to add “and the caught fish should be eaten by the appropriate
consumers and the environment is not polluted afterwards”. In this regard, we
have set a task before us, <b> ‘To teach creativity methodologies which must
motivate learners to put their gained knowledge and tools into action”. </b>
Innovative process represents a process of systems state transition, that is, it
transforms related systems from a prototype state to an improved state. Namely,
here systems inertia should be taken into consideration. <u> Systems inertia</u>
is the attempt or effort made by the given system toward preserving the old
state and always resisting the transition to the new state if the new state does
not coincide with the change tendency at the prototype state.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the special theory of relativity, the maximum
velocity of motion is equal to that of light in vacuum, i.e., there is not
infinite velocity. For this reason, we can conclude that systems inertia is the
attribute inherent in any system and state transition time (<u>inertia time</u>)
is always greater than zero. Human psychology is only one kind of system, thus, <u> psychological
inertia</u> may be considered as a special case though a very important case of
systems inertia.</p>

      <p ALIGN="left"><b>2. TRIZ: Dialectical Systems Thinking for Problem Solving and
  Decision Making.</b></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For preparing TRIZ users a teaching program may be designed
to present only TRIZ content accompanied by illustrations and exercises. Doing
so is useful because, in the sense of advantages, TRIZ in comparison with the
trial and error method is like an excavator in comparison with a shovel. But
practice shows that the excavator’s user works better when he/she understands
the basic knowledge and working mechanism underlying this excavator. In other
words, TRIZ learners need to know and understand TRIZ knowledge sources and
logic. For this reason, in our basic course “Creativity Methodologies”, one
special chapter is devoted to presenting these related issues including
psychology of creativity, systems theory, dialectics and patent information to
the extent of preparing learners for understanding and using TRIZ competently
later on. Some other applied knowledge derived from cybernetics, information
theory and other generalized sources are introduced to learners later during the
teaching when needs for that appear.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this paper we confine ourselves to making emphasis on some
points concerning dialectics and systems thinking.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dialectics is the science of most common laws of nature,
social and mental development. Creativity is associated with a development, so
TRIZ has selected dialectical laws as its philosophical foundation.</p>
<p>There are three basic laws of dialectics:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law of the negation of negation, which conveys
        the direction of development.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law of the mutual transformation of quantitative
        and qualitative changes , which demonstrates the mechanism of
        development.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law of unity and struggle of opposites, which
        demonstrates the source of development.</li>
</ol>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of them, the third law is the nucleus of dialectics and the
first two laws may be considered as particular cases.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the three basic laws of dialectics there exist
also non-basic laws. Non-basic laws of dialectics are those universal laws which
reflect relationships of phenomena in the universe. Since these relationships
are very diverse, they are expressed in a large number of laws. In particular,
these non-basic laws include essential, stable, recurrent and intrinsic
relationships between:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The individual, the particular and the universal</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Phenomenon and essence</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Form and content</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cause and effect</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Necessity and chance</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Possibility and reality, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Development, from the viewpoint of dialectics, can be
understood as follows:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supposing at first the system was at some level of
development where there was unity of opposites. This unity does not exist
forever . Because of changes and a struggle (mutual interaction) between the
contrary sides, the initial unity is broken and a contradiction arises. The
contradiction is resolved so that the system turns to a new level of development
(new unity). In the long run, another contradiction will emerge and will be
resolved again so that the system will turn to a newer level of development...
and so on without ending. Figure 3 shows crudely development, creativity,
innovation and problem solving process in dialectical meaning.</p>
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image4.gif" width="600" height="389"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unity 2 (object after improvement) in comparison with Unity 1
(prototype object) has both newness and usefulness simultaneously so Unity 2 is
also the creativity product. In terms of dialectics we can say Unity 2 negates
(replaces) Unity 1. Dialectical logic reflects the logic of development,
therefore the logic of creativity. According to TRIZ, to solve a problem is to
resolve contradictions on a win-win basis to turn the given system into a new
unity of two contrary sides where previously those sides eliminated each other,
that is, into a new level of development. In TRIZ there is the means that helps
the solver to reveal and to resolve revealed contradictions.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In fact, the human problem solving process represents the
process of discovering contradictions and resolving them. Therefore, three kinds
of contradictions put forward in TRIZ (administrative, technical and physical
ones) are general, i.e. they exist in all kinds of problems. In other words,
these concepts of contradictions and ways of resolving them can be fully
enlarged to non-technological areas including daily life activity.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Example (derived
from business):</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>There was a man who loved animals very much. Whenever he got
some money, he brought home to raise birds, cats, dogs, bears, elephants and so
on. One day, he wanted to become a professional businessman in trade of animals
but he did not want to leave his animals - those he himself fed and trained.</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>Thereby, the physical contradiction is: these animals have to
be sold to get profit and not be sold to be enjoyed by their owner.</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>The answer was to let these animals for rent. That means
selling them for a while and then getting them back, and over and over again. In
his case, the renting established the unity of two contradictory sides: “selling”
and “not selling.” The principles used in this example were Continuity of
Useful Action and Periodic Action.</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mankind has to study objects and solve problems that are
getting more and more complex. The approach considering the whole as an
arithmetical sum of components is not suitable any more. It is necessary to have
an approach that permits us to study not only the components and the
dependences, actions and influences between them, but also the qualitative
change of the whole in relation to these components. <u>System</u> is defined as
follows: a system is an assembly composed of connected component elements so
that the whole assembly has such properties which cannot be reduced to the
properties of the separate component elements or connections. These properties
are called <u>systemness</u> (or <u>wholeness</u>) of the given system. The
systemness is used to express the specific function of the system or to answer
the question “For what is the system born (or constructed)?”</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of systems connections, any change happening
somewhere in the system or in the surrounding environment will not be located at
that place but will spread throughout the system and beyond it. This <u>systems
change spreading effect</u> may cause contradictions inside and/ or outside the
given system.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The systemness depends on both the elements and the
connections. For this reason, it is possible to develop the systemness by
changing (in the largest meaning, for instance, modifying, adding, removing,
nesting) the elements, or the connections, or both. In this sense, TRIZ tools
(for example, 40 principles) work as systems transformers.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Development in general and creativity in particular become
with time more and more complicated. For that reason, the knowledge of systems
research is consistently used in TRIZ, see Figure 4.</p>

</sup>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is always a particular system in each problem. TRIZ not
only requires but also creates devices (for example, System Operator) that help a solver to “see”, think about and process, at
least, “nine-systems thinking display”. It is needed because, information
resides in any of its systems which may have influence on or serve as prompts to
a solution to the given problem.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ is a concrete expression of applying dialectics and
systems research to the creative thinking process, that is, such a kind of
creative thinking directed by objective systems development laws. This directing
mechanism helps the solver to eliminate a considerable number of barren trials
not coinciding with the solution’s direction.</p>

  </blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reality, we may deal with multifunctional systems. In
these cases, for the n-functional system we can consider it on each-function
basis separately and for each-function consideration we also have two axes
existing in TRIZ Systems Operator: axes of time and systems hierarchy.
Certainly, these n ways of consideration are interrelated.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to that, though TRIZ also takes into account the
subjective (psychological) side of creativity (e. g. psychological inertia,
imagination) for human beings’ happiness it is not enough. The point is that
different people have different urgent needs, interests, preferences,
perspectives ... And all of these things may be correct, need to be respected
and taken into consideration by the problem solver, even from the viewpoint of
the whole of a community or the whole of mankind.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to all said above the third<u> axis called axis
(or dimension) of consideration </u> has been introduced into TRIZ Systems
Operator (see Figure 5). Then, the axis (or dimension) of consideration and
together with it, the axis of systems hierarchy will revolve on the axis of time
as many times as there are ways of consideration by interested people. Axes
which are ones of time, systems hierarchy and dimension of consideration form
the <u>Systems Space</u>. In particular, for only one dimension of consideration
we have the <u>Systems Plane.</u></p>
<sup><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image6.gif" width="446" height="560"></p>
</font>

</sup>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With introducing the dimension of consideration, there may
arise a new kind of contradiction: contradiction between different systems
belonging to different dimensions of consideration. According to TRIZ win-win
solution the solver must find the solution which is good for all these systems
simultaneously.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generalizing all presented above we have put forward the<u> Ideal
Criterion for Good Solution/ Decision</u> as follows:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The solution/ decision which is being considered the good one
should be good not only for the system residing in the given problem but for all
systems and environment in systems space. Of course, to meet this criterion is
very difficult. For practical use, we have reduced it as follows:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The solution/ decision which is being considered the good one
should be good not only for the system residing in the given problem but, at
least, for all systems and environment residing in the nine-systems display if
there is only one dimension of consideration, or for all 9n systems and
environment if there are n dimensions of consideration.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our view, the concept of Ideal Criterion for Good Solution
(ICGS) is very important for many reasons. Some of them are as follows:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The contemporary challenges faced by us such as
        fast change, increasing complexity, diversity and competition lead to an
        increasing amount of problems at all levels. Because of that, no system
        can solve all problems for the rest of systems. All systems are
        interrelated, so if ICGS is not maintained a solution of one system may
        cause problems for other ones. And further, the system which made the
        given decision in the past can encounter new problems in the future as
        negative consequences. As a result of this, we do not have the needed
        sustainable development.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, if the given solver (or
        decision maker) should take the consequences in the form of punishment
        from society or within his/her conscience then his/her life would not be
        happy. So ICGS may serve as a motivating factor for human beings’
        actions.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Educating all people, especially from early ages,
        to keep ICGS during the problem solving process, in our view, may help
        to lift cultural and ethical levels that now do not correspond to
        economic, scientific and technological progress.</li>

paragraphs which can be (and in our view, should be) understood in the largest

a larger extent in light of these sources.</p>
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image7.gif" width="600" height="438"></p>

emphasis on the diversity of application of TRIZ tools and statements on a daily

</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you and we have seen, TRIZ itself is a large theory with a
great number of creativity tools. Though we strive to structure our program so
that it takes learners through simple issues to more complicated ones and every
part of the program is a logical successor of previous ones, in fact, even those
people who have learned the whole of TRIZ may not “see the wood for the trees”.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To avoid this, at the end of each course we always provide
learners with a review of the whole program.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Altshuller wrote about the relationship between
principle, method and theory as follows: “Crudely expressed, principle, method
and theory form a chain of the type “brick - house - city” or “cell -
organ - organism””. In other words, if we take TRIZ as a system then the
method will be a subsystem and the principle - subsubsystem. According to a
systems logic, a systemness of a system defines systemness of component
subsystems and in turn, the given subsystem defines systemness of component
subsubsystems and so on. To follow this logic in the thinking process for
solving problems is very important, especially for problems in daily life and
work where learners do not use (or cannot use ARIZ) but used to use only some
principles or methods. We always require our learners to pay their attention to
this logic by emphasizing that they should use principles or methods not for the
sake of these principles or methods but for the sake of transformation of the
given system residing in the problem in accordance with TRIZ objective laws of
systems development.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are nine laws of systems development in TRIZ:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law of conpleteness of component parts of the
        system.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law of passability of transference of the system.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law of concordance between component parts of the
        system.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law of increasing the degree of idealness of the
        system.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law of non-uniform development of component parts
        of the system.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law of the transition to development at level of
        the supersystem.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law of the transition from development at
        macrolevel to microlevel.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law of increasing the degree of controllability
        of the system.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law of the transition from one S-curve to
        another.</li>
</ol>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following are some examples of an understanding and
application of TRIZ, see Figures 7, 8, 9, and 10.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among them, Figure 9 shows how to explain the process of
development of the given system (i.e. the pointer) logically in terms of TRIZ
principles, methods and laws. Eight principles found in the pen-pointer which
are arranged in a certain order of their application can serve as one of
possible TRIZ methods. This method can be applied to other similar objects in
order to develop them (e.g. to the feather duster, see Figure 10).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additionally, in Figure 9, reflections of TRIZ laws also can
be seen:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the law of concordance
between component parts of the system (e.g. concordance between the pointer’s
user and the environment where he/she should carry it with herself/himself -
Cushion in Advance and Dynamicity);</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the law of transition
to development at level of the supersystem (e.g. the pen-pointer is a
supersystem in relation to the separate pointer and pen - Consolidation);</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the law of non-uniform
development of component parts of the system (e.g. in the system pen-pointer the
mechanical pointer is developed into the laser beam, meanwhile, the pen remains
the same);</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the law of the
transition from development at macrolevel to microlevel (e.g. from mechanical
rod to photons - Replacement of Mechanical System);</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the law of increasing
the degree of idealness of the system (e.g. Continuity of Useful Action and
Universality);</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the law of the
transition from one S-curve to another (e.g. from paradigms of mechanics to ones
of optics).</li>

interpersonal problem.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Story</b> written by
Vu Huu Su and published in the issue 28 July, 1997 of the newspaper “Kien Thuc
Gia Dinh” (Family’s Knowledge):</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>One of the people I often visit is a writer who is always
busy writing novels and short stories. His wife is a literary critic. His two
children are gifted students.</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>There has been a cold war between my friend and his wife for
two weeks. It was just because of a proverb.</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>His daughter, who majors in literature, asked him,</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>“Daddy, could you please explain the meaning of the proverb
‘The daughter-in-law abstains from eating September Rau-muong (a popular kind
of water spinach in Vietnam), saving it for her mother-in-law’?”</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>“It’s not so difficult to understand the saying, dear”,
replied the father, “Rau-muong is rare in September, as that’s not the
season for growing it. The proverb is for praising dutiful daughters-in-law who
always save rare, good things for their mother-in-law. Understand?”</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>“Yes, I do”, said the daughter.</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>“What an explanation!”, his wife interfered. “September
is not the season for growing Rau-muong. That’s true. Yet this means September
Rau-muong is not as good as usual, but very tough, tart and fibrous. Though it’s
hard to find it, it’s not precious at all. The proverb is not for praising but
for mocking foxy daughters-in-law, who are ‘wolves in sheep’s clothing’.
Get it?”</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>He replied: “This proverb came from ordinary people who are
honest and simple, not as fault-finding as you critics. For you, to read is just
to seek for the work’s content, and theme, and idea and the like without any
understanding of literature and artistry at all”</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>“How can we find the artistic merits in such works as
yours? Right, so I know nothing about literature and artistry. Then why did you
insist on me writing recommendations for your works so many times?”</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>“The poor and stupid want to be intellectual, likewise,
short-sighted people always peer around”.</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>“How right you are! I’m such a peasant! I’m so
short-sighted! But why were you so crazy about this girl? Can you remember how
many tears you have cried over me?”</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>The argument continued that way, on and on. And these are its
last words.</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>“OK. We’ll get divorced then!”</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>“Thanks a million! Go ahead! Write an application for it! I’ll
sign it immediately!”</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>Neither of them has written the application. Yet they haven’t
said a word to each other since then and just communicated through their
children. Also, they have slept separately at night…</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>I would not have given this incident a second thought if I
had not visited a friend who deals with divorce cases. He said with grief, “The
humorous yet sad fact is that <b>up to 80% of divorces are caused by such
trivial conflicts.</b> It is just because neither the husband nor the wife wants
to give himself/herself up. <b>If only each of them could make concessions to
the other.</b>”</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>Yes. If only they could make concessions.</i></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Note:</b> the husband’s interpretation is wrong. The wife’s
interpretation is correct in accordance with the meaning given in the Dictionary
of Vietnam’s Proverbs.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Comments:</b></p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suppose that the husband and wife are famous writers. This
means that they have a high level of creativity. But in this story they are not
happy because they cannot solve the family’s problem well. In this connection,
I suddenly remember the phrase said by one hero in a novel whose title I forget,
“To be happy is more difficult than to be famous”.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The author’s advice
in this story, <b> “If only each of them could make concessions to the other”
i</b>s common. Following this advice repeatedly, however, may lead to stress and/or
depression. Then, stress and depression will be a greater problem than the
original. Problems should be solved well, they need not be hidden.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <b>“Up to 80% of
divorces are caused by such trivial conflicts”</b>. Why? We can see that the
married couple cannot control themselves. Inversely, they are controlled by a
harmful positive feedback which amplifies the tension between them and can
destroy their family. Imagine what heavy consequences would happen to them and
their children if they had divorced and what a society would be like which had
many such divorced families. And in this case life will be, in fact, a sea of
torments.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From our viewpoint, the
behaviour of the people in this story is the common behaviour of non-TRIZ users
or not in TRIZ logic.<br>
    <br>
    The point is that, the family should be considered as the
system with its systemness. The system should be developed in accordance with
the TRIZ laws of systems development. In this story, at least, violation of the
law of concordance between component parts (the family’s members) of the
system (i.e. the family) arrests our attention immediately.<br>
    <br>
    Violation of the TRIZ laws is a strategical mistake in the
meaning that, further using TRIZ methods and principles cannot solve the
conflict because they are used outside the context of the TRIZ laws. For
example, in this story, the married couple actually do not want to get divorced
but they stand before the new problem, how to communicate with each other. To
solve this problem, they use the principle Mediator (i.e. communicated through
their children). The use of the principle Mediator here creates not progress but
regress in comparison with the family’s state before the quarrel, thus
violates the law of passability of (in this case, of information) transference
of the system. And the family’s cold war remains and is not resolved.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, imagine that the
daughter is a TRIZ user and needs to solve the problem of the meaning of the
proverb. According to TRIZ logic she should not immediately think about a new
system (i.e. her father) to solve her problem but should first try to solve the
problem by herself. This means that she should comply with the TRIZ law of
increasing the degree of idealness of the system and use the accessible
intrinsic resources (i.e. principle of Self-service) to arrive at a solution.
The accessible intrinsic resources can be revealed here as follows:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suppose the proverb in the text was written in
      quotation marks. These marks are an obvious intrinsic resource as they act
      as a clue towards the author’s intent: anything written inside such
      punctuation can be seen as ironic - thus the meaning is not to praise but
      to chastise the daughter-in-law. If the daughter could recognize this she
      could arrive at the correct interpretation.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another accessible intrinsic resource is the context
      in which the proverb is used. The daughter should use the context to draw
      meaning from the proverb rather than utilize another system (her father)
      to solve her problem.</li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps, as they are such a literary family, there
      is a well-stocked family library, maybe, even containing a Dictionary of
      Proverbs, from which the daughter could gather the meaning of the proverb.
      This, again, is an intrinsic resource and would negate the need to
      introduce another system.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6">
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now if her father were
a TRIZ user, he would consider the relation between him and his daughter as the
relation between instrument (father) and product (his daughter). According to
the law of increasing the degree of idealness of the system he would act towards
becoming the ideal instrument in the meaning that without him, his daughter
(product) could solve her problem on her own. In other words, he should invest
the TRIZ way of solving problems in his daughter, which would help her to solve
not only the given problem, but, at least, her analogical problems in the
future. Writing in this point, I remember similar trends of investment:
student-centered teaching in education, employee-focused management,
customer-oriented business and the saying “the next process is our customer”
in Total Quality Management (TQM).<br>
    <br>
    In this story, after supposing that the father is a TRIZ user
there may be two possibilities.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The father does not know the meaning of the proverb.
      So it is for him a problem.</li>
    <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The father knows the meaning of the proverb.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
</p><ul>
<li>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the first case, he should find the right meaning by
himself using the accessible intrinsic resources, teach his daughter the way of
solving the problem and finally, recognize that he did not know the meaning of
the proverb before. This helps him to convince his daughter of the power of the
scientific methodology of TRIZ.<br>
    <br>
    In the second case, he simply teaches his daughter how to
solve her problem, but never gives the meaning of the proverb in a ready form.<br>
    <br>
    However, in reality, the father is not a TRIZ user. Instead,
he merely guesses at the meaning of the proverb and offers this as the right
explanation. Why does he do this? One reason is probably psychological - his
need for respect in front of his wife and daughter. If he admits he does not
know he loses respect.</p>
  </blockquote>
</li>
<ol start="7">
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now suppose the wife
had been a TRIZ user. Her duty then would be to criticize the husband because he
is wrong and his wrong answer is in turn influencing the daughter’s learning.
However a technical contradiction is present in this situation: if the wife
corrects her husband the daughter will understand the right meaning of the
proverb, but the husband will lose the respect of the daughter. If the wife does
not correct her husband he will retain his respect, but the daughter will
wrongly understand the proverb. The situation may well become worse when the
daughter offers her incorrect interpretation in class. Further, the wife stands
before a physical contradiction, that is, the wife should correct her husband so
the daughter understands the proverb and not correct him in order to satisfy his
need for respect.<br>
    <br>
    The solution to the wife’s problem is as follows: the wife
should wait until she and her husband are alone and then show him the Dictionary
of Proverbs with the true meaning in it. She should suggest that the husband
corrects the daughter when they are on their own. There is a good chance then
that the daughter’s respect for her father would actually increase in regard
to his ability to audit his mistakes. This solution can be seen as utilizing the
transformer Separation of Opposite Requirements (i.e. criticizing and not
criticizing) in Time.<br>
    <br>
    In the future, if everyone in the world is a TRIZ user, in
our view, a great number of problems like the ones in this story which need not
arise will disappear and all unnecessary tragedies will be avoided. Then, the
sea of torments becomes step by step the sea of happiness.</li>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A: head ; B: body; C: hands; D: legs.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>Step 2</u>: Determining possible morphological types of each
functional part enumerated in the step 1</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A (head): head 1; head 2; head 3; head 4.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">B (body): body 1; body 2; body 3; body 4.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C (hands): hands 1; hands 2; hands 3; hands 4.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">D (legs): legs 1; legs 2; legs 3; legs 4.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And building morphological matrix (table), see Figure 11</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>Step 3</u>: Compiling morphological formulas which have a
general form:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A<sub>a</sub> - B<sub>b</sub> - C<sub>c</sub> - D<sub>d</sub> , where a, b, c, d = 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this case, we have 256 specific formulas (dolls)</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some dolls are as follows, see also Figure 11.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>Step 4</u>: Analyzing, evaluating and selecting best formulas
(dolls)</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Comments:</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our view, Step 1 is a combination of two principles:
Segmentation and Local Quality. Step 2 is a principle: Local Quality again. Step
3 is a principle: Consolidation. And Step 4 is a principle: Extraction.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Summing up, at last we have:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Morphological Analysis Method = Segmentation + Local Quality
(1) + Local Quality (2) + Consolidation + Extraction.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such an analysis can also be used for other non-TRIZ
creativity methods.</p>
