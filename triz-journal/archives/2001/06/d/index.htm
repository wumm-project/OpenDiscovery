<p>An answer to the question &quot;What is the essence of TRIZ?&quot; stated in
50 words and then explained in 2 pages. See the “TRIZ Home Page in Japan” at<br>
<a href="http://www.osaka-gu.ac.jp/php/nakagawa/TRIZ/eTRIZ/" target="_blank">http://www.osaka-gu.ac.jp/php/nakagawa/TRIZ/eTRIZ/</a><br>
for the 2 page description, and for many other TRIZ resources in both English
and Japanese.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>Essence of TRIZ:</p>
<p>Recognition that<br>
technical systems evolve<br>
towards the increase of ideality<br>
by overcoming contradictions<br>
mostly with minimal introduction of resources.</p>
<p>Thus, for creative problem solving,<br>
TRIZ provides a dialectic way of thinking,<br>
i.e.,<br>
to understand the problem as a system,<br>
to image the ideal solution first, and<br>
to solve contradictions.</p>

<p>Originally written as a section of my paper to be presented in ETRIA
Conference, Nov. 2001. (See the TRIZ Journal <a href="../../../../calendar.htm">Calendar</a>
section for details on this conference.)</p>
<p>I've posted this section in advance with the hope of helping readers and
smoother promotion of TRIZ in the world.</p>

What is the Essence of TRIZ?&nbsp;</B> This question must be most basic and
important for us to teach/learn TRIZ.&nbsp; There are many important principles
and methods in TRIZ, such as:</FONT>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT face=Century>40 Principles of Invention</FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Century>76 Standard Inventive Solutions</FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Century>Trends of Evolution of Technical Systems</FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Century>Altshuller's Contradiction Matrix</FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Century>ARIZ, etc.</FONT> </LI></UL><FONT
face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any of these, however, is too huge to be
regarded as the core essence of TRIZ.&nbsp; Essence of TRIZ does not exist at
this level of handbook-type knowledge, but exists much deeper at the philosophy
level.</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For extracting the essence of
TRIZ, we should first understand the <B>overall structure of TRIZ</B>.&nbsp; I
understand <FONT color=#3333ff>[1]</FONT> that</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B><FONT face=Century>TRIZ = Methodology + Knowledge
  base</FONT></B></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Century>and TRIZ has the following three
aspects:</FONT>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT face=Century><B>Methodology (a)</B>: New view of technology</FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Century><B>Methodology (b)</B>: Thinking way for problem
  solving</FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Century><B>Knowledge Base</B>: A collection of examples
  implementing the methodology (a)</FONT> </LI></UL>
<P><BR><FONT face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This view makes it clear that
the essence of TRIZ should be found in the Methodology (a) and (b).</FONT>

<P><FONT face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I obtained this understanding
mainly through my study of Salamatov's TRIZ textbook [2], and showed this
compact statement for the first time as a slide in the presentation at
TRIZCON2001 [3] and recorded it in my Editor's Note as the post-script of the
TRIZCON paper in my Web site ("TRIZ Home Page in Japan").</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain this 50-word
statement briefly in a top-down manner:</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, TRIZ is stated to
be "<B>a recognition</B>", in other words, "<B>a new view</B>" of technology
(i.e. Methodology (a) mentioned above).&nbsp; By sharing this recognition, or by
viewing technology from this point of view, we can reach a position of
tremendous scope of not only technology but also science, society, our life,
etc.</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most important recognition is
that "<B>technical systems evolve</B>".&nbsp; We see technology mainly as
technical systems.&nbsp; Any system is composed of a number of components (i.e.
subsystems) and their relationships and may be regarded as a subsystem of its
super-systems.&nbsp; Every technical system evolves, i.e. changes/develops in
its history.&nbsp; This evolution forms huge trends containing but overwhelming
individual inventions.&nbsp; The evolution may appear in different phases and
different ways, such as birth, expansion, integration, convolution, etc.</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technical systems evolve
"<B>towards the increase of ideality</B>".&nbsp; This recognition is called the
Principal Law of Evolution.&nbsp; Ideality is defined as "Principal
function/(Mass + Energy + Size)" in Salamatov [2] and sometimes as "Useful
function/(Cost + Harmful function)".&nbsp; These definitions are qualitative in
nature.&nbsp; Main recognition here is that various forms of evolution can be
viewed universally as movements in the direction of increase of ideality.&nbsp;
This recognition forms our basis of foreseeing and developing future technical
systems.</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evolution occurs only "<B>by
overcoming contradictions</B>".&nbsp; Contradictions appear first as the gaps
between demands and supplies (or current technological performances).&nbsp; Such
contradictions are once recognized as obstacles/barriers, are compromised
somehow for a while, and then are overcome by break-through inventions.&nbsp;
These inventions form the micro-steps of evolution in technical systems.</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overcoming of contradictions are
achieved "<B>mostly with minimal introduction of resources</B>".&nbsp; Easy
introduction of additional resources (such as substances, energy, and size)
often complicates the systems and does not solve contradictions.&nbsp; It is the
TRIZ' recognition that contradictions are overcome only with no or minimal
introduction of resources.&nbsp; This corresponds well with the law of increase
of ideality.</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the basis of the recognition
stated above, TRIZ wants to provide a methodology (i.e. a way of thinking)
"<B>for creative problem solving</B>".&nbsp; This is the principal aim of
developing and learning TRIZ.&nbsp; Problem solving is most demanded for
overcoming contradictions.&nbsp; Since no solutions and no way of solutions are
known beforehand for such contradictions, we have to solve them
creatively.</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For creative problem solving,
"<B>TRIZ provides a dialectic way of thinking</B>".&nbsp; TRIZ provides us with
a way of thinking, in its most general meaning.&nbsp; Beyond various specific
methods, heuristics, and tricks for problem solving, TRIZ shows us a new way of
thinking.&nbsp; It may be introduced as "a dialectic way of thinking" by using
terminology in philosophy, according to Salamatov [2].&nbsp; The main
characteristics of this way of thinking are explained in the succeeding phrases,
"<B>i.e.</B>":</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, "<B>to understand the
problem as a system</B>."&nbsp; The objects of the problem should be regarded as
(technical) systems, for which TRIZ gives deep insights as stated in the above
recognition.&nbsp; We should also understand that the problem itself forms a
hierarchical system of problems.&nbsp; With this understanding, we may have
multiple and evolutionary view points of the problem and of its possible
solutions.</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, "<B>to image the ideal
solution first</B>."&nbsp; This is of course based on the TRIZ recognition that
the technical systems evolve towards the increase of ideality.&nbsp; Since we
know the direction of evolution, we should think of the solution image
first.&nbsp; We should image the ideal solution first, and then try to find the
ways of achieving it, for example by tracing back to the present system step by
step.&nbsp; This recommends us a thinking process in the reverse direction, in
contrast to the conventional way of thinking with trial-and-errors starting from
the present system.</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, "<B>to solve
contradictions</B>".&nbsp; Dialectic logic is often referred in philosophy with
"solving the contradiction between a thesis and its antithesis by introducing
their synthesis", even though the actual process for achieving it has not been
explained well.&nbsp; TRIZ, however, has succeeded in showing concrete
guidelines (especially in the form of ARIZ) to solve contradictions in technical
problems.&nbsp; The core process is to derive (by reformulating the problem) a
Physical Contradiction (i.e., a situation where an aspect of a system is
requested in one direction and in its opposite direction at the same time) and
to solve it with the Separation Principle.&nbsp; Once a physical contradiction
is derived, this solution technique is amazingly powerful to find break-through
solutions.</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Century>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should notice that the three
characteristics of the dialectic way of thinking in TRIZ correspond very well
with the TRIZ' recognition of the technical systems.</FONT> <BR>&nbsp;
