<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Summary</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">TRIZ, being utilized for creating innovation scientifically,
suggests us to think step by step excluding psychological approach. As a result,
TRIZ is negative against Brainstorming (BS) that is thought as leap and try and
error thinking. This is the reason why BS is considered as being in the opposite
position of TRIZ. Considering TRIZ and BS from thinking skill perspective,
however, it could be said that both are complementary to each other for creative
problem solving and that this combination will possibly lead to more efficient
thinking. In this paper, I try to describe feature of TRIZ and BS in comparison
and explore more effective of TRIZ.</p>
<b>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">1, For more effective use of TRIZ</p>
</blockquote>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is almost three years since TRIZ was introduced to Japan
in full scale. Many manufacturing firms, universities and research organs pay
attention to TRIZ at present, and examine it whether or not to introduce it to
their firms. We, The SANNO Institute of Management TRIZ team, have held
introduction seminars, trainings and consultations to them. Fortunately, all of
our clients are satisfied with the results so far. However, there are still many
firms which hesitate to adopt TRIZ or doubt the power of TRIZ even they have a
TRIZ software. This, maybe, comes from lack of understanding and underestimation
of TRIZ. From now on, we will engage in research effect use and spread TRIZ in
Japan.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There are some points, which I am anxious about through my
TRIZ trainings and consultations. In this article, I will discuss most
interesting theme for me now. Some persons cannot associate a suggestion to an
idea, while other members get an idea on same issue. It seems that the person
who cannot open the final door to goal, even standing in front of the treasure
room.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">What is the difference between these two kinds of people; one
can open the door and the other cannot open the door? Is this depending on their
creativity? <font lang="JA">&#65321;</font>t may be right. However, is this
question so simple? Is TRIZ the scientific methodology for invention, which does
not depend on personality and occasions? In fact, some people who cannot reach
the goal tend to insist that TRIZ is useless.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">2, Anything to learn from Brainstorming?</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For above question, it seems to me that some of creativity
development tools such a Brainstorming (BS) has an answer. Many of TRIZ
specialists including Altshuller are seemingly negative to BS and other
psychological approaches as typical try and error methods. Though I agree with
them in many points, there are a few important points to learn from BS. Because
there is a fact that many creative results have been made using creative
existent skills in Japan.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">* Originally developed in Japan</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Table 1 is the result from a little over 400 companies
answers, conducted a survey by SANNO using a questionnaire form, taken out
against the Japanese listed manufacturing industry 2000 companies in August
1989. It shows that BS is especially ahead from other skills.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">By the way, it is well known that Japanese economic
development has been supported by high productivity and quality. And this high
performance is supported by accumulation of small improvements, which is so
called KAIZEN, by bottom-up approach such as Quality Control Circle and Small
group activities. BS has been main idea generation tool in these activities.
Therefore I limit myself to discuss BS in this article. Next chapter shows the
comparison BS with TRIZ, and searched for the effective way of use of TRIZ.</p>

<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">3, A characteristics comparison of BS and TRIZ</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">TRIZ is the synthetic methodology of a creative problem
solving, and BS is a just simple tool of idea generation. Therefore, the scale
and depth are too different to compare both equally<font lang="JA">&#65292;</font>I
particularly try to compare them to explain difference in the concept and method
of BS and TRIZ. Below is the table of comparison between BS and TRIZ.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>(1) A difference in the target zone and a difference in
the approach</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">These two are greatly different from the background. BS was
born by A.F. Osborn who worked with the advertising agency and developed in the
field of the marketing for merchandise, naming of goods and product planning
etc. On the other hand, TRIZ was born as a main object, and it has been
developed in the engineering field. The marketing works on the person, in other
words, the idea is asked something new whether to create a good image, or strong
impact in the market. The idea in the engineering field is seeked for following
Mother Nature as object are in the natural science field. The quality of the
idea looked for in this meaning is greatly different. Therefore, necessary
knowledge is different to create an idea, too. As a result, the way of thinking
in engineering should follow cause and effect of Mother Nature, the way of
thinking in marketing should follow cause without effect directly. If it is
thought as mentioned above, it could be explained that TRIZ suggests proceeding
step by step and BS suggests leap and intuition thinking.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>(2) A difference in the structure as problem solving</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Psychologist Gilford has shown us elements of the person's
intellectual ability like a) recognition, b) memory, c) divergence thinking, d)
convergence thinking and e) evaluation. When a problem is recognized and we try
to search for a solution of a problem, two methods are chosen. One is the method
which depends on a past knowledge and experience. A solution of a problem is
completed if an appropriate answer can obtained. Of course, if his/her knowledge
and experience are not sufficient, information is collected from the colleagues
or books. At any rate, the power of a) and b) is almost used and the
regeneration of the knowledge and experience can be accomplished. But, when an
answer cannot be obtained from the knowledge and experience, or well-known
method, because of patent infringement, cannot be used, it becomes necessary
that an idea is created by themselves. Divergence and convergence thinking
support creativity.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">BS 4 rules are, strict prohibition of criticism, free
thinking, big quantity required and improvement by combination. These rules show
that BS is typical divergence thinking. In order to make divergence thinking
more effective at BS, group thinking is held based on free association. An
association is a response to a certain stimulus. By association group thinking
rather than by individual thinking will bring a good results of quantity and
variety. Therefore, BS can be said as the way of looking for an idea
accidentally<font lang="JA">&#65294;</font>So, quantity is required. It doesn't
try to look for high quality ideas from the beginning. It is good if a few
effective ideas come out as a result by examining from every direction, the
basis does not matter<font lang="JA">&#65294;</font>So, quantity is sought for
intensively, and it tries to change an accident into the necessity. It is
thought that quantity brings quality. However, the knowledge that makes idea is
limited because it depends on member's knowledge and experience. As for the idea
of the marketing field works on a human being, the person who generates idea can
evaluate the idea. If it is an interesting idea, it can be estimated idea
generator that it is interesting by.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As BS is the method of divergence thinking as stated above,
BS is only one part of steps of the problem solving which requires comprehensive
synthetic thinking. As a result, it should be define and analyze problem and
estimate ideas. The method of the various use of BS has been searched and
developed, and it is difficult to define BS strictly as it has been expanded so
greatly. As for the utility, the idea of the various application of BS has been
piled up so far.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">So, let's return to the improvement of quality and cost
reduction through bottom-up activity. Smaller improvement ideas are asked for
rather than the progressive idea because of the small range of authority of the
work in this activity. Bottom-up is being supported mainly by the person in
charge of the manufacturing work place. Generating a progressive idea is the
work of the research and the development department. Bottom-up activities, which
have been supported by work places, were QC circles, and VE activities in Japan.
It was BS or Osbron’s checklist that was used in the idea generation step
during such activities. Table 1 shows this.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, TRIZ is equipped with technique, process,
and knowledge-database as a comprehensive methodology of a creative solution of
problem. TRIZ is the methodology of synthetic problem solving not seeing an
example besides this.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p align="left">Figure 1: The structure of TRIZ<br>
<img border="0" src="01.gif" width="374" height="189"></b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Because TRIZ is the comprehensive methodology of problem
solving, it make possible to get a progressive idea through the step-by-step
process. Moreover, as for being fortunate, many scientific phenomena have
already become known by the predecessors' contribution. And, direction of
invention is known including improvement of the ideality were made clear by the
research of the technology evolution. Thanks to this research, TRIZ can get the
progressive idea, without leap thinking.</p>
<b><font face="MS Mincho" lang="JA">
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
</font></b>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>(3) The weak point of BS and TRIZ</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Difference between BS and TRIZ in the way of thinking has
been discussed in the above chapters, these can become both a strong point and a
weak point depending on user's requirement. There are many complaints that BS
can generate many ideas but most of them are not useful to solve problems. But,
it will be well explained in the followings reason why this good idea didn't
come out.</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Insufficient focusing on problems</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Free association couldn't be developed, and meeting ended
    in collection of the member's knowledge only</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Ideas drown were not refined</li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, discontents with TRIZ are as follows,
learning takes time, too many choices at each step, even if it gets suggestions,
it is not easy to connect with the idea.<font lang="JA">&#12288;</font>As matter
of fact, it takes 30 minutes to learn BS, while many hours to learn TRIZ. It can
be expected improve considerably by understanding the fundamental way of
thinking of TRIZ and how to use computer software, and so on. And an effort like
this cannot be spared if you think about the result of a solution. As pointed
out first, there still remains a problem. Even getting suggestions from TRIZ,
they cannot be connected with the idea. Step by step proceeding adds sureness
because an aim can be seen and finished by the little jump. But, a problem is
that some people cannot connect suggestion with idea. Then, what will happen if
this step is made more detailed? It becomes easier to connect the suggestion to
the idea. But the choices increase further, and a process becomes long. Even if
steps are dived into more small, directions still remain directions, and they
can't become answers. It falls into Achilles and tortoise competition paradox.
But if we cannot get it over, some of the misunderstanding and underestimation
against TRIZ won't be avoided.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Can we obtain a good idea using step-by-step TRIZ with free
association of BS? In other words, to get good idea, free associations which is
guided by step-by-step thinking is used.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p align="left">Figure2: A difference in the thinking process<br>

<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font lang="JA">&#65300;&#65292;</font>TRIZ supplemented by
BS</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">(1) Learn from the BS</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font lang="JA">&#12288;</font> Altshuller was negative to
BS. It is not known how BS was defined by him. For one reason, it seemed to him
that it was the counter situation to step-by-step thinking.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Without knowledge as a material to generate idea, only a
commonplace idea may come out certainly from the idea. If the rule of BS does
not work effectively, it will be no use. Whether or not you know the natural law
of the capillary action for moving water, the result will be different.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">But, there are some points to learn in the BS as well when
the above comparisons are taken into consideration. Take it for example, the
rule , strict prohibition of criticism, is important. Divergence thinking is a
type of thinking method to spread freely and convergence thinking is a type of
thinking method to put together. To think something, both types of thinking are
required. But to think effectively it should not be used together. The rule of
BS tells us to distinguish and to use the thinking method properly. And the rule
that ideas taken out is to be written down on a paper is very important and
meaningful. Furthermore, imagination for free association is indispensable to
creation. As mentioned earlier, TRIZ provides us many suggestions to generate
ideas in inventive problem solving; it leads us to the front door of the
solution plan but plan itself isn't provided. It is left for us ourselves to
change suggestions and knowledge into effective solution plan. The power of
imagination becomes necessary by all means for the transformation here. Though
BS expects a big jump in the free association, TRIZ proceeds logically, step by
step, and at the end small jump is expected. The power which supports these
jumps is imagination.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>(1) Development imagination</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There is a word to say “Imagination produces creation.”
This means that the source of the creation is the imagination. For example
please imagine how to make a cup. The methods are, a string of soil is piled up,
the lump of soil is shaved, which it begins to shave it into shape form, people
who know how to produce will be able to imagine variously. One who know the
methods of manufacture regenerates that knowledge, but it means that the first
step of the creation is really taken when he imagines &quot;Can I make it if I
do this way?&quot; without knowing. Besides above, the way, the center of the
lump is pushed, a little lump is piled up, some boards are made and combined are
taken. If that method has never been tried, it could be called a kind of
creation. An imagination and a daydream are driving force of creation, too. From
the viewpoint of the creative power training, just to imagine a smart little
people move around is good enough.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">To transform imagination into creation, a series of
imagination in our mind is necessary. First an image is to be drawn in our mind
clearly, and then image is to be operated in a certain direction, finally the
result is described clearly.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p align="left">Figure 3: Controlled imagination process<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="03.gif" width="303" height="65"></p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is knowledge database and the principle of the invention
in TRIZ that lead the image drawn in our mind in to one direction. Though
ability to judge is effective in choice of knowledge, imagination is necessary
for changing a suggestion into the solution plan. TRIZ is led in the step
by-step-process from problem recognition to concept making<font lang="JA">&#12289;</font>but
a goal is not connected in a straight line from the start. It is imagination to
connect the step by step.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Figure 4: Variety of segmentations<br>
<br>
</b><img border="0" src="04.gif" width="275" height="290"><br>
<img border="0" src="05.gif" width="313" height="434"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I adopt the training of imagination to the member driving
TRIZ application for the above reason. For example, an image doesn't appear on
“segmentation” of the invention principle as well to the persons of poor
imagination. It is such a thing that it is taken to pieces at most. When “segmentation”
is suggested, there will be two, three, and four, infinitely to molecule level.
Take a cup for example, even if two are suggested, it varies with left and
right, top and bottom, outside and inside of the body of the cup, the space of
the inside. Can you draw a vivid figure freely in your mind? This kind of
imagination brings you an idea.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>(3)&#12288;Improve insight</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Insight is also a part of the association power. It can be
described as reasoning power. As for insight, the word that came from the
meaning “to understand what happens before you see”. TRIZ, the structure is
analogical thinking, which tries to make use of the principle learned from the
past patents and inventions are of great use for the future invention. When the
commonness of the problem as an analogy and the principle of the solution are
led, insight is needed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Finding the solution plan not seen yet from the invention
principle presented as a suggestion is a sequence of an invention principle,
imagination and creation. The ability which ascertains the function and
perceives commonness is required here.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For example, a success of present plate glass mass production
system<font lang="JA">&#65292;</font>so called floating production system, is
the invention that lead from the oil dripped in the water by analogical
thinking. The oil dripped in the water and the plate glass manufacturing process
has commonness in principle. What is this commonness? It is the fact that film
oil = board or a lump of oil dripped becomes a board. Current manufacturing of
the plate glass, which is the main stream, is excellent for making flat sheets
in mass production.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">To look for the condition from other phenomena, sharp insight
is indispensable. TRIZ supports this most part. To understand the way of analogy
thinking and examples, the way of taking a function. How to take a function?
Though a function means the role of substance, it cannot be seen directly in the
eyes. Main function of glass is to hold water, and bottom of glass is flat to
stand itself as a secondary function. Form and material are chosen to attain a
certain function. There are many cases in the technology field where analogical
thinking is utilized in the light of function advanced. A functional point of
view is very important. The training of the power which sees through the way of
being functional and of catching it is necessary, as well as seeing common point
which supports insight.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">5, Conclusion</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As a premise, for the fundamental training of TRIZ and use of
software, I believe that effect is improved when the training shown above is
carried out. The contents shown here are good results in some of my own
experiments, it may be only a hypothesis in the point, that data are not
sufficient enough. I apply this only at the preparation stage of TRIZ training.
A strong tool of a methodology may be established. It still remains as theme for
continuous study for me to verify this hypothesis by more trustworthy data and
to enrich the methodology.</p>
