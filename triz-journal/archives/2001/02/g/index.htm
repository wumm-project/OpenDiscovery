<p>Conclusions</p>
</font></b>
<p>An analysis of the results supports the following conclusions:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>The IWB provided the highest number of Directions (Table 1, Category A),
    recommendations (B) and solution ideas (C) - in other words, it is the most
    exhaustive tool.</li>
  <li>The Containment ring problem (weight versus mechanical strength) can be
    considered as a rather typical problem, that is, frequently faced in various
    industries. Given the results (“the best ten” ideas distribution (Table
    1, Category D), time spent for obtaining solutions (F) and price of the
    tools, it is obvious that for a problem of that type, the Improver is the
    most cost /time /effective tool.</li>
  <li>All obtained ideas can be divided into groups according to the system
    (subsystem) they recommend to change. The table 2 (below) shows how these
    ideas are distributed between tools utilized:</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>The distribution above illustrates the fact that the largest amount of
  ideas is related to the containment ring improvement (in accordance with the
  original problem statement). At the same time, the IWB is also more effective
  when the possibilities to enhance an existing system are rather exhausted and
  a new approach to a long-standing problem is necessary (11 ideas versus 1-5
  for the other tools for the group #2).</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
  <li>The IWB (and, to a lesser extent, the Improver) is redundant - i.e., the
    idea/recommendation ratio for the IWB (Table 1, Category E) was 2.94 versus
    2.27 for the TechOptimizer. This redundancy can be characterized by the
    following positive and negative features:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <u>
  <p>Positive</p>
  </u>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Provides with the opportunity to nearly exhaust potential solution
      space, which is an important advantage in situations when it is critical
      to be sure that the best possible solutions are obtained (to secure
      intellectual property through obtaining patents, for example).</li>
    <li>When working with the IWB, different recommendations often lead to
      similar ideas. For this reason the user avoids missing good ideas that did
      not, at first, attract his attention. (This feature is especially
      important for new users who have little or no experience in TRIZ and
      TRIZSoft).</li>
    <li>New or inexperienced users often merely ‘browse’ through the
      software without paying adequate attention to the recommendations
      presented. A similar recommendation appearing again and again tends to
      result in (1) the user becoming more inclined to give it credence, and (2)
      the user gradually developing a solution (making a transition from feeling
      “There is nothing here “ to - Wait, there is something here” and
      finally - “Wow, this is great!”).</li>
    <li>Due to this redundant/recurrent structure, the user never finds himself
      in a situation of having explored every pathway to no avail, or having no
      idea how to continue with his problem-solving efforts. Additional pathways
      to explore are always presented (though after a while the number of new
      ideas generated will necessarily drop).</li>
  </ol>
  <u>
  <p>Negative</p>
  </u>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Exhausting all possible solution pathways takes time. For a problem
      similar in scope to the Containment Ring problem, carrying out this work
      using the IWB should take approximately 2-3 days, whereas it took about a
      day using the TechOptimizer. (The Improver takes about 1.5 days.)</li>
    <li>A new user may get a feeling that he/she is ‘going in circles.’ To
      optimize the results/time/exhaustiveness issue, the IWB was designed in
      accordance with the 80-20% rule (i.e., 20% of the total effort put forth
      should produce 80% of the results). If exhaustiveness is not mandatory,
      the time required can be significantly reduced, while promising ideas will
      surface during the first hours of work.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
  <li>Notwithstanding our efforts to create an unbiased comparative case study,
    we cannot completely exclude the influence of such factors as TRIZ
    expertise, adeptness or previous time spent in using the tools, etc. We
    invite others to conduct their own comparison using this or a similar case
    study, and gladly welcome the resulting data, recommendations, and
    critiques.</li>
