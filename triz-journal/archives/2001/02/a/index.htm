<p><b>ABSTRACT</b></p>
<p>Advances in technology, global competition, customer focus, and other factors
are influencing the manner in which many companies develop and structure
training systems and how they perform the training. The Theory of Inventive
Problem Solving (TRIZ or TIPS), is a methodology and set of tools that can be
utilized to study the evolution of training tools and systems and generate idea
concepts for future innovations and technology developments in the field.</p>
<p>The Ideal Final Result, patent analysis, and the Patterns of Technological
Evolution were applied to training systems and tools to determine the potential
innovations and uses of technology in the field. Based on the analysis, training
systems and tools seem to be evolving towards a decreased role for the trainer,
increased adaptability to the trainee, and increased control, analysis and
evaluation of the trainee and the system. Computers have contributed
significantly to the evolution and will continue to play a major role in
advancing training tools and systems towards ideality.</p>

<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>In Warner Brothers 1999 film <i>The Matrix</i>, Keanu Reeves stars as Neo, a
computer hacker who discovers that the world is not what it seems. He awakens
from the matrix to find the world ruled by intelligent computers who feed on
humans by imprisoning them in a simulated reality - what we know as everyday
life. In the film, Neo and his associates learn complex skills like martial arts
instantly by plugging into a computer-training program via a portal in the back
of their heads. Definitely science fiction, but could training systems really
evolve in this manner?</p>
<p>In nearly every industry, global competition, rapid advances in technology,
and customer focus are forcing companies to change the way that they produce and
market their products and processes, manage their businesses, and interact and
support their employee base. The average worker’s career is more dynamic today
than that of their counterparts of 30 years ago. Individuals are more likely to
transfer job positions and companies and less likely to spend their entire
career devoted to a single company or industry. These changes have also impacted
the types and amounts of formal and informal training that companies and
industries must provide to their employees in order to support their business
needs and maintain a competitive edge [US Department of Labor - Bureau of Labor
Statistics]. How will training tools and systems evolve to support the dynamism
that is ever present in industry and particularly manufacturing?</p>
<p>The evolution of training tools and systems can be evaluated through the
application of TRIZ, The Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving. TRIZ is a
methodology and set of tools, developed and refined by Genrich Altshuller and
his colleagues in the second half of the 20<sup>th </sup>century (and still
going!), that defines a systematic approach to creative problem solving,
invention and innovation.</p>
<sup></sup>
<p><b>EVALUATION METHODOLOGY</b></p>
<p>TRIZ enlists multiple tools and methodologies that can direct the study of
the evolution of training tools and systems and the generation of potential
innovations and technologies in the field. The tools to be utilized in this
instance are the generation of the Ideal Final Result, patent analysis, and the
application of the Patterns of Evolution.</p>
<i>
<p>Generation of the Ideal Final Result</p>
</i>
<p>The basic function of a training tool or system is to structure or contribute
to the transfer of knowledge/skills to a trainee. Ideality explores the notion
of attaining the desired function of the system without the existence of the
system. What is the ideal situation for the transfer of knowledge to a trainee?
Ideally, trainees should systematically, consistently, and thoroughly train
themselves to acquire the particular knowledge and skills necessary to perform
the desired actions without a formal training system or tool. From a time
perspective, the knowledge should be acquired automatically, or in a short
period of time.</p>
<i>
<p>Patent Analysis</p>
</i>
<p>A search for patents pertaining to training tools and systems in the archives
of the United States Patent Office resulted in some interesting trends. The
number of applicable patents was small (approximately 100), and the patents were
strewn across various industries, including education, medicine, and defense.
The earliest patent dated back to the 1960’s, and none of the patents reviewed
were particularly applicable to or originated from manufacturing.</p>
<p>In general, a pattern of increasing feedback and controllability, as well as
a decreasing role for the trainer was evident within the patents. Some of the
first patents protect rights to training aids that assist a trainer in
transferring the knowledge to the trainee. One such example is the lifeless
resuscitation dummy that is still used today in first aid training. More recent
patents described the use of audio and video aids to assist the trainer and
provide instruction to the trainee (Golf self-help videos are a perfect
example). In a different vain, one Honda facility is utilizing a simulation
board game to teach key employees the main principles of manufacturing, as well
as decision-making and strategy skills for defect management.</p>
<p>The introduction of computers to facilitate the transfer of knowledge
comprised the next generation of patents. These patents progressed from a
computer providing a programmed response to the trainee based on her/his input,
to the addition of computer monitoring of equipment that the trainee is
operating, to adaptation of the program to the trainee’s responses, progress,
and pace. Some of the latest patents explore real time feedback, interpretation
and analysis of the trainee’s responses and progression, networking, and the
use of virtual reality to facilitate the transfer of information. In all of
these patents, an individual may be present to manage or control the learning
environment, but not to singularly teach or transfer the required material or
skills. The material within the reviewed patents can be applied to the Patterns
of Evolution to trends and potential innovations within training tools and
systems.</p>
<i>
<p>Application of the Patterns of Evolution</p>
</i>
<p>The patterns of technological evolution are a series of eight guides that
represent the general manner in which many products, processes, systems, and
technologies develop and progress. Four of the eight patterns seem to be
particularly applicable to training system and tool evolution.</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Evolution in Stages - In the TRIZ methodology, the determination of the
    maturity of a system is aided by the analysis of particular metrics over
    time (performance, level of invention of patents, number of inventions,
    profitability). In the case of training systems, these metrics are difficult
    to evaluate. The patents are few and are spread across many different
    industries with varying needs and standards; thus, it is difficult to assess
    the inventiveness of the patent. Data is generally not specifically tracked
    or available to assess the performance or profitability of training tools
    and systems. However, given the general progression of the available patents
    as compared to the Ideal Final Result, I believe that training systems are
    in the childhood stage. The use of computers has significantly impacted the
    progression of the systems and tools, but training is still by no means
    completely controlled by the trainee and skills and knowledge are not
    transferred automatically.</li>
  <li>Evolution Towards Increased Ideality - As discussed previously, the Ideal
    Final Result is to transfer the skills and knowledge without a system. What
    are some of the implications of the Ideal Final Result? The disappearance of
    the trainer, the appearance of tools that enable the trainee to guide
    himself, simplified operations that eliminate the need for experience or
    long apprenticeships? Analysis of the patent literature indicates that the
    tools and systems are increasing towards ideality. Systems are slowly
    decreasing the role of the trainer by utilizing computers to take on those
    responsibilities. In addition, the systems are also transferring
    responsibility to the trainee for performing and controlling her/his own
    training.</li>
  <li>Evolution Towards Increased Dynamism and Controllability - This trend is
    certainly evident in the patent literature. The introduction of computer
    systems has established life-like simulation, real-time feedback, analysis
    of the trainee’s progress and pace, and evaluation of the impact and
    success of the system. Companies may have better control of their systems
    and the ability to adapt them quickly to meet the needs of the trainees.
    Adaptability may be a key trend and support a number of innovations in the
    field.</li>
  <li>Evolution Towards Decreased Human Involvement - In accordance with the
    Ideal Final Result, the computer technologies being applied to training are
    most definitely decreasing human involvement in the process. Computers have
    the potential to provide many of the useful functions of the trainer, while
    eliminating the variability and inconsistencies that may exist between
    trainers.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></p>
<p>In general, based on the analysis using the TRIZ methodology, training
systems and tools seem to be evolving towards a decreased role for the trainer,
increased adaptability to the trainee, and increased control, analysis and
evaluation of the trainee and the system. Training may soon be evolving towards
computerized systems which monitor an employee’s actions and make suggestions
and corrections based on a variety of inputs - bar code and movement sensors,
weight and force, keystroke inputs, voice response, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, the availability and development of technologies, cost factors,
and ultimate need, as well as a multitude of other factors, will determine how
quickly and in what ways companies will evolve their training systems and tools.
Who knows, one of these days, we all might plug in to learn a skill or a trade
like the characters in <i>The Matrix</i>. I could certainly use the help with my
golf swing!</p>
