paper introduces a model of a conflict situation developed in order to formulate
a comprehensive set of &quot;thinking directions&quot; for a conflict
resolution. It increases reliability of dispute mediation and helps disputants
to find mutually acceptable Win-Win solution. Proposed approach can be used by
most of conflict resolution techniques.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Most of conflicts might be resolved simply by disputants'
listening to each other, by clarifying expectations and complains. Sometimes a
solution is obvious, and people do not see it because they think of revenge
rather than resolution. However, some disputes are so complicated that the only
way to resolve them is invitation or intervention of mediator (<i>Gage, Martin,
Gromala, 2000</i>): a supervising manager, a lawyer, a policeman, a
psychotherapist, a priest, or a close friend.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Conflict mediation has its own rules, procedures, approaches
and techniques (<i>Moore, 1996</i>). The most of them consider the conflict
resolution as a process, with the following stages (<i>Potter, 1996</i>):</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Gathering information</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Solving a problem of the conflict</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Selection of mutually agreeable solution</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Implementation and follow-up</li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This process, if successful, should result in either Win-Win
or Walk-Away solution. Win-Win solution resolves the conflict by satisfying
interests of both disputants, and allows disputants to continue their
relationships. Walk-Away solution resolves the conflict by breaking
relationships between disputants, and allows disputants to satisfy their
interests on their own. The Walk-Away solution, in this case, might be
considered as a variation of Win-Win solution. Some authors (<i>Fisher, Ury,
Patton, 1991</i>) name it BATNA, the Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The third way to resolve the conflict, the Win-Lose solution,
is not likely to be implemented by disputants, and usually results in conflict
escalation.</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">1.2 Shortcoming of current approaches</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Special techniques and recommendations are developed for
proper gathering of information on the conflict, selection of the most suitable
solution, as well as for planning both implementation and follow-up (<i>Moore,
1996</i>; <i>Potter, 1996; Kreidler, 1984</i>). Following these suggestions
helps mediator to pass these stages of process successfully. Dispute mediation
is more likely to fail, as some authors admit (<i>Potter, 1996</i>), during the
problem-solving stage. Reasons for these failures are as follows:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">A mediator should avoid suggesting solutions; solutions
    should be proposed by disputants, otherwise they won't be implemented.
    Success of problem solving depends on creativity of disputants rather than
    on mediator's facilitation abilities.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Only Win-Win solutions beneficial for all disputants are
    acceptable. These solutions can be found by resolving contradictions
    embedded in the conflict situation. This requires substantial creativity on
    disputants' side.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Disputants are under stress, and their creativity is
    significantly impaired.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">People don't like to solve problems. &quot;Being faced
    with a problem becomes a problem&quot; (<i>Hicks, 2000</i>)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <b><i>
    <p>1.2.1 Avoid suggestions</p>
    </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </i></b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The reason for avoiding suggestions is as follows:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The ultimate goal of a conflict resolution is to change
disputants' behavior and relationships. Such changes expect significant efforts
on disputants' side. Disputant should be committed to apply these efforts. If
somebody else suggests solution, people are not so committed and try to find
shortcomings (&quot;Yes, but…&quot; reaction - <i>Potter, 1996</i>) as future
excuses for proposed scheme not being implemented, for efforts not being made,
and, finally, for conflict not being resolved.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A successful mediator facilitates rather than solves and
suggests. However, there is a trap. Whether or not the solution is found is
determined by creativity of disputants rather than by mediator's facilitation
abilities. Success is hardly under mediator's control, and this &quot;side
effect&quot; seems unavoidable.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <b><i>
    <p>1.2.2 Nature of Win-Win solution</p>
    </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </i></b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If disputant does not expect some benefits from the
agreement, efforts on its realization are not likely to be taken. All disputants
should really benefit from solution, so that benefits compensate for
inconvenience from making efforts.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Usually, disputants consider a conflict as a &quot;zero-sum
game&quot;: what one side wins, the other side loses. Win-Win solutions cannot
be achieved in this case: a benefit for one side always becomes a loss for
another side. Fortunately, our life is not a zero-sum game. People pursue
different goals, so they can always find a resource that meets the following
requirements (<i>Fisher, Ury, Patton, 1991</i>):</p>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">It is available and unimportant for
    one disputant</li>
  </font>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">It is unavailable for and highly
    desired by another disputant</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Transfer of this resource from one side to another is not
  considered as a loss by a giving side, but is considered as a gain by a taking
  side. If such a set of resources is found for all sides, the Win-Win solution
  is achieved.</p>

      <b><i>
      <p>1.2.3 Walk-Away solution</p>
      </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </i></b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Another way to resolve contradictions embedded in a
  conflict is separation of the disputants, termination of their relationships.
  Although it seems easy to do, in reality it isn't. People usually need
  somebody's help in achieving goals and meeting needs.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Ending some relationships means losing a chance to gain
  something. From this standpoint, Walk-Away solution is likely to be a
  Lose-Lose one.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Fortunately, it is not so sad. There are many people
  around, and there are many ways to satisfy needs. Some other people can do the
  same, without undesired side effects. Some other way does not assume these
  particular relationships to stay intact. Some other goals can equally or
  better satisfy the disputant's needs.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">So, even so sad thing like broken relationships can become
  a gain, not a loss.</p>

      </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </i></b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Win-Win or Walk-Away solution resolves contradictions
  embedded in the conflict situation. Resolving the contradictions usually
  requires substantial creativity.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Thorough look at any &quot;psychological&quot; approach to
  innovative problem solving brings to light one mutual key element: situation
  that is the most favorable for creativity is <b>stress-free</b>. Inventive
  thinking works only if the inventor's mind is freed of any worries, tensions,
  fears, etc. Successful facilitators are aware of importance of a friendly
  atmosphere inside a team.</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">Tip: Make your work place a fun place to be.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">(<i>von Oech, 1990</i>)</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">A conflict mediator has to facilitate people who hate or at
  least dislike each other, who prefer fight to friendship. The disputants are
  under stress that can significantly impair or even block ability of some
  people to make a decision (<i>Heller and Hindle, 1998</i>).</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Under such circumstances, facilitator has to set all hopes
  upon luck.</p>

    </blockquote>
  </b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">A mediator is always under risk to cross the fuzzy border
  between prompt and solution and violate the &quot;Don't suggest&quot; rule.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The above situation can be considered as a following
  contradiction:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">A mediator <i>should give</i> hints to disputants in
    order to activate and support their creativity, and <i>should not give</i>
    any hint to avoid suggesting a solution.</p>

  <p align="JUSTIFY">As any contradiction, this one can be and is to be
  resolved.</p>

      <b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">2.2 The Ideal Final Result</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The Ideal Final Result in this case looks like this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Disputants on their own, without any creativity on their
    side find the solution.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">2.3 A way to resolve the contradiction</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The contradiction can be resolved, for example, through
  separation of opposite requirements in time. Here, it means the following:
  prompts, hints are prepared by mediator in advance. These &quot;thinking
  directions&quot; are determined by ideality, ways to resolve contradictions,
  etc., and represent the practically comprehensive set of alternatives. These
  prompts help disputants in considering the available options.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">A new problem arises: if prompts are prepared in advance,
  they do represent all alternatives, but they are formulated in too general
  fashion. And, the more general is a prompt, the less effective it is in
  initiating the creativity.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Let us consider this new problem as a contradiction:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Prompts <i>should be</i> prepared in advance in order to
    represent all alternatives available, and <i>should not be</i> prepared in
    advance because they are too general and, thus, less effective.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">We can resolve it by separating opposite requirements
  between the entire object and its parts. In this case, it means that the
  entire prompt should be prepared in advance, but some of its parts should be
  prepared at the instant the conflict is discussed.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">A prompt should consist of two parts. A part formulated in
  advance describes the issue <i>in general.</i> Another part contains the
  specific information on the conflict being discussed. Combination of these two
  parts provides a mediator with issue formulated <i>in particular</i>.
  Practically comprehensive set of situation-specific issues can be developed (<i>TRIZ
  in Progress, 1999</i>).</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">2.4 Creative result of non-creative work</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">What's more interesting, consideration of these specific
  issues separately does not require any significant level of creativity.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Disputants are asked the questions so that they know how to
  answer to the issue. Then, these answers are combined according to simple
  rules into three Concepts: Win-Win solution for both disputants, and one
  Walk-Away solution for each disputant.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">This combination of several known &quot;ideas&quot; gives,
  sometimes, result that is not so obvious, i.e., creative output. It happens
  because some known ideas in this combination start supporting each other,
  providing each other with lacking resources.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">It means that the Ideal Final Result is accomplished.
  Creativity is necessary to find new resources for both Win-Win and Walk-Away
  solution. As soon as mediator gives the prompt what particular kind of
  resource should be considered, naming and listing the available resources
  becomes less creative work.</p>

      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </b>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Experts (<i>Kreidler, 1984</i>) distinguish the following
  major types of conflict:</p>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Conflict over resources</li>
  </font>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Conflict of needs</li>
  </font>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Conflict of values</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">When two or more people want to get something that is in
  short supply, such as orange, open or closed window, money, attention,
  respect, etc., this conflict occurs over the resource. When somebody's need,
  such as need for self-esteem, power, achievement, contradicts realization of
  need of another person, the conflict of needs takes place. When values,
  beliefs clash, we deal with the most difficult type of all conflicts to
  resolve, the conflict of values.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Though this classification seems very logical and clear,
  real conflict can seldom be categorized. First, the majority conflicts show
  themselves as conflicts over resources: people rarely can fight for something
  invisible. Second, each real conflict involves everything: sharing the
  resource, unmet needs and insulted values.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">It means that while dealing with any conflict, one should
  consider it as blend of all three types; the difference is in proportion.</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Disputant A and B need to achieve

      that it does not need the expected opponent's behavior&quot;.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">&quot;What other way can be used to achieve the
      [disputant's goal] so that the [disputant's expectation] is not anymore

    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">One should replace text in parentheses with the appropriate
  information on situation.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Analogically, such &quot;thinking directions&quot; can be
  formulated both <i>in general</i> and <i>in particular</i> to all changeable
  elements.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Some of these directions work for Win-Win solution, and

  known ways to take the opportunity should be developed. Everything that comes
  to disputant's mind must be listed without any criticism.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">If the disputant does not have any idea for some
  opportunity, additional prompts could be offered. These prompts are based on
  system approach.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">For example, if the issue</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&quot;How to improve the way to achieve the
      [disputant's goal] so that it does not depend on neither [disputant's

  </blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">is under consideration, the following prompts might help:</p>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">How the disputant's efforts can be
    intensified?</li>
  </font>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">What if disputant applies multiple
    similar or different efforts?</li>
  </font>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">What kind of action could intensify
    the disputant's efforts?</li>
  </font>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">How to concentrate or focus the
    disputant's efforts on achievement of this goal?</li>
  </font>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">What additional approach can help
    in disputant's efforts?</li>
  </font>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">What efforts seem to be more
    effective in accomplishing this goal? How to replace current efforts with
    more effective ones?</li>
  </font>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">What obstacles are on the way of
    disputant's efforts? How to remove them in advance?</li>
  </font>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">What kind of environment is more
    favorable for disputant's efforts? How to shift to such an environment?</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">As these lists of additional questions <i>in general</i>
  are developed in advance, a mediator can simply use an appropriate list at a
  proper moment. If a mediator possesses information what efforts a disputant
  was trying or going to apply, this information can be used to formulate each
  question <i>in particular</i>, to make answering easier.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Disputant should not be creative to answer these questions,
  though the answers obviously give a lead to the opportunity realization.</p>

alternative, both disputants should decide in this way.</p>

    each other in concept</p>
    </blockquote>

</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The general intent of combination is as follows:</p>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Any decision or agreement involves
    many actions, functions, events</li>
  </font>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Every function, action, event has
    many alternative ways to be accomplished</li>
  </font>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Every alternative needs many
    different resources to be properly accomplished</li>
  </font>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Every alternative brings its own
    set of resources that can be used to accomplish other event, function or
    action</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">It means that some combination of alternatives might become
  a self-supportive concept.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">The following visual model describes this idea.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Desired solution can be represented as a rectangle:</p>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<p align="left"><img src="02.gif" width="332" height="210"></p>
</font><font color="#000000">
<p align="JUSTIFY">Now, an idea is found:</p>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<p align="left"><img src="03.gif" width="348" height="242"></p>
</font><font color="#000000">
<p align="JUSTIFY">Looks ugly, doesn't it? This idea does not meet all needs and
requirements, i.e. it has drawbacks. Usually, such an idea is to be discarded.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Now, while working with different alternatives, several other
ideas have been found:</p>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<p align="left"><img src="04.gif" width="426" height="295"></p>
</font><font color="#000000">
<p align="JUSTIFY">They are not perfect, as well, although they cover other
areas of our need.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">What happens if all these ideas are combined?</p>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<p align="left"><img src="05.gif" width="423" height="295"></p>
</font><font color="#000000">
<p align="JUSTIFY">Combination covers the entire area, i.e. each idea
compensates for weaknesses of others.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This kind of combining does not need any creativity. The only
thing needed is to consider each idea as a support for others. However, the
result might be highly unobvious, though novelty is not a goal in dispute
resolution.</p>

and allows disputants to find mutually acceptable resolution of conflict
situation. This approach is complimentary to and compatible with most of known
conflict resolution techniques:</p>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">This approach is

    disputants</li>

    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">Its &quot;output&quot; delivers the
    solution that meets all requirements to the Win-Win resolution of a conflict</li>
  </font>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#000000">As all &quot;thinking
    directions&quot; and additional questions <i>in general</i> are prepared in
    advance, they support regular mediator's facilitating activities</li>

  neither unusual changes in her or his approaches nor any additional training.</p>
