Creation Supporting Tools&quot;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Prof. Susumu Kunifuji, Head of Center for Knowledge Science,</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Hokuriku</p>
<font face="?? ?????" lang="JA"></font><b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Abstract: </b>Man, organization, process, technology and
knowledge are essential for knowledge creation. Preparation of process,
technology and knowledge is essential as the infrastructure for constructing a
knowledge creation environment. There are three kinds of knowledge creation
supporting tools, namely divergent thinking supporting tools, convergent
thinking supporting tools and integrated thinking supporting tools. Awareness
and tangibility are now in spotlight because they support not only non-tacit but
also tacit knowledge.</p>

Policy Trend&quot;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Hidenori Yasuda, Safety Science and Policy Department,
Mitsubishi Research Institute</p>
<font face="?? ?????" lang="JA"></font><b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Abstract: </b>Since Clinton's speech on 21 January 2000, Nano-technology
holds the spotlight also in Japan. But, even in the United States, leaders in
nano-technology are using this term with different meanings. The national
strategy in nano-technology, which the United States government will conduct, is
overviewed, and a trial IM approach to nano-technology, which is a paradigm
shift of all the technologies, is discussed.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Abstract: </b>INAX began introducing TRIZ(TechOptimizer 3.0J)
in September, 1999. The laboratory has mainly been conducting in-house education
and enlightenment. It also has been trying to make TRIZ popular by generating
ideas for solving problems and building a simple TRIZ software tool that could
be used over the intranet. These TRIZ case studies at INAX and the opinion of
the promoter are introduced.</p>

Products&quot;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Prof. Haruhiko Iizuka, The College of Engineering, Kanto
Gakuin University</p>
<font face="?? ?????" lang="JA"></font><b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Abstract: </b>Case studies on &quot;PET(polyethylene
terephthalate) Bottle Collector&quot; and &quot;Bump Managing Wheelchair&quot;
applying various TRIZ tools are introduced from product development case studies
of graduation researches at the university. Through these case studies, it is
attempted to compare and investigate the design solution acquiring processes of
TechOptimizer, TOSC and ARIZ.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">16:30-17:30 - IMC Presentation</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Introduction to Semantic Processing Technology&quot;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Mikhail Verbitsky, Application Engineering Division,
Invention Machine Corporation</p>
<font face="?? ?????" lang="JA"></font><b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Abstract: </b>Nowadays, due to progress in utilizing
information, corporate data is increasing at an amazing speed, doubling its
volume every 6 months. Also, 5 million pages of information are added to the
Internet every day. Because of such information overload, it is getting very
difficult to find relevant (wanted) knowledge, thus leading to inefficiency of
information utilization. To cope with problems like this, Invention Machine
Corporation has developed an amazing semantic processing technology. Using this
technology, the structure of sentences can be analyzed and knowledge can be
extracted in a &quot;problem and solution&quot; format. Specifically, you can
create vertical knowledge bases (limiting to technologies in a certain domain)
and horizontal knowledge bases (focusing on functions across various domains),
conduct competitive analyses, novelty tests, intellectual capital management
(patent management) and searches for a new market (new usage for existing
technologies).</p>

Lights&quot;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Setsuo Arita, Power &amp; Industrial Systems R&amp;D
Laboratory, Hitachi, Ltd</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Abstract: Multiple concepts for determining light degradation
of navigation lights under aviation runways and guiding ways were generated
using TRIZ, and patents were applied for. A halogen lamp is used as the light
source of the navigation light. When the tungsten of the filament evaporates, it
adheres to and blackens the inner side of the bulb of the light source.
Consequently, the light degrades to make it difficult for the airplane pilots to
see it, thus the bulb has to be replaced. The light degradation should be
determined about once per day.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Fumio Suzuki, President, ABEL Systems</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Step 1 (Primary Search): In order to generate a strategic
patent net of a device, relevant patent net is searched for the main function of
the device and expected technologies realizing such function. Then, Knowledgist
is used to generate a general patent map broadly searching the acquired patents.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Step 2 (Secondary Search): Specific claim items thought of as
one's ideas are checked concretely whether they interfere other patents using
the patent net referred to in Primary Search.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Step 3 (Result Reflection): Claim items are drawn up (using
HyperTech's patent specification drawing assisting software tool &quot;Patent
Creator&quot;).</p>
