<p>Introduction</p>
</b>
<p>One of the problems commonly associated with the use of the system operator
tool emerges from the way we draw it or see it presented to us. Almost
inherently in either situation, we are separate from the 9-Windows; we sit above
them, looking down on them from a third dimension; we are outside, separate from
the windows, looking in. While this can sometimes be a very useful stance to
take (indeed in the next article in the series, we will be examining this vital
three dimensional aspect in some detail), it can also inhibit our understanding
of the reality of a problem situation, and -we will hopefully see here -
seriously impair our ability to solve a problem in the most effective way.</p>
<p>This article is thus aimed at examining the consequences of us looking at the
9 windows as outside observers versus what happens when we are able to enter the
windows and look at the problem situation from within.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p>One way to look at this is that we place ourselves ‘in’ each window and view
the other windows from this new perspective. Something like the 9-windows
picture shown in Figure 1.</p>

Perspective</p>

<p>If this picture is difficult to imagine (we do afterall live in a
three-dimensional world), some people find it useful to recast the windows as
‘rooms’ they become a part of, and from which they can see each of the other
rooms - Figure 2.</p>

</b></font>
<p>In any given problem or opportunity situation, any or all of the viewing
directions shown in Figure 1 may provide a valuable new insight into a solution.
Rather than look at all 16 of the viewing perspective possibilities, the article
examines some of the ones most likely to be useful in the greatest number of
instances. We start with a viewing perspective already likely to be familiar to
experienced TRIZ users - that found through the eyes of the Smart Little People:</p>
<b>
<p>Connections With Smart Little People (SLP) Tool</p>
</b>
<p>The Altshuller derived SLP tool - like its earlier precedents independently
derived from other sources (e.g. Synectics) - was developed as a means of
helping problem solvers to empathise with the problem situation by ‘becoming the
problem. This is in effect changing the viewing perspective of the problem
owner; the person (or rather the smart little people) ‘becomes the problem’. The
problem owner enters the sub-system and re-examines the problem situation from
that new perspective - Figure 3.</p>

</font><font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 3: SLP Is About Entering/’Becoming’ Part of the
Sub-System</p>
</b></font>
<p>A classic example of this kind of empathetic viewing perspective change is
Einstein imagining how someone traveling on a ray of light would view their
surroundings; viewing the bigger picture from the perspective of a small part of
it was crucial to the formulation of his theory regarding the speed of light.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate the value of the SLP tool and the new viewing
perspectives they force upon us, we choose to examine a problem somewhat closer
to the practicalities of engineering design; that of designing components that
are resistant to erosion damage. In trusting that readers will be able to
connect a specific example to a much more generically applicable situation, we
will examine the case of sand erosion of helicopter rotor blades (Figure 4). </p>
<font SIZE="2"><b></b></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

</font><font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 4: Helicopter Flying In Sandy Conditions</p>
</b></font>
<p>This is a potentially serious problem for helicopters expected to operate at
low altitudes in sandy or dusty conditions - the helicopter rotor blades rotate
at very high speed and stir up a lot of air. If the aircraft is close to the
ground, this air will cause sand to be lifted into clouds, and thus potentially
be struck by the high speed rotors. The relative size and strength of helicopter
rotors perhaps suggests that such impacts won’t cause problems, but the reality
of the situation is that the impact of hard silica-based particles onto a
plastic and fibre based composite rotor at velocities of several hundred metres
per second can cause rotor life to drop by several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>As recommended by the classic SLP tool, Figure 5 sees us zoom-in to the zone
of conflict - at a region of the composite rotor blade about to strike a sand
particle at very high speed. Although useful, this view is still not going to
provide us with too much assistance in developing effective solutions to the
problem. In fact the view drawn is quite likely to encourage us to maintain an
‘external’ view of the problem. A typical solution response to this kind of
problem view would be to stick a layer of protective material to the outside of
the vulnerable rotor surface. This is indeed a solution we can find many
examples of in the patent database, across many industries facing similar impact
erosion problems. In the large majority of cases, subject experts now know, this
type of solution offers little more than temporary relief, and may in the longer
term actually make the problem worse than if there had been no protective layer
added.</p>

</font><font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 5: Helicopter Rotor/Sand Zone Of Conflict</p>
</b></font>
<p>The SLP view, on the other hand, encourages us to take on a viewing
perspective in which we become the problem. In this case we become a group of
smart little people sat on the rotor, watching a sharp edged rock approaching us
at very high speed.</p>
<p>Given that situation, my response as someone looking at this big, sharp thing
hurtling towards me is three-fold; 1) I would like something to shield myself
with, 2) I would like someone around me to help, and, 3) I and they should brace
ourselves, and then try to absorb and/or deflect (turn the harm into a
resource!) the energy of the incoming projectile. Thinking about myself
surrounded by neighbours (I’m in the system, looking at the rest of the system
now) I imagine a situation like that illustrated in the sequence of figures
shown in Figure 6.</p>
<p>Translating this SLP solution concept back into the real world situation, I
might then imagine a blade construction in which a hard outer armour layer is
used to cover an inner layer which is able to ‘give’, elastically absorb energy,
and then use that stored energy to encourage the sand particle to be deflected
away from the blade. This hard layer/soft-layer concept in fact turns out to be
a protection technique used quite commonly within nature. It has yet to see any
significant inroads into the word of engineering yet, however, and so there is
probably scope for the generation of some significant intellectual property in
the concept.</p>

<b>
<p>What Happens If I Apply The Same Viewing Perspective Change in Different </p>
<p>Windows?</p>
</b>
<p>So we have seen the ‘becoming part of the system’ concept produce some
different solution perspectives via the SLP tool. What about when we place
ourselves in some of the other windows and view a problem from their
perspective? </p>
<p>The opposite of the SLP direction is the ‘becoming part of the super-system
looking in at the system’ view. Or, ‘what does my system look like, when I view
it from the perspective of the outsider?’ In crude terms, this perspective might
be seen as that of a customer looking at a product. More importantly, from a
problem solving perspective, it is not just about encouraging the problem solver
to recognize that the super-system exists (which is what the classic 9-Windows
tool is trying to do), but encouraging them to adopt the position of that
customer and to see the system from their perspective (including therefore, all
the things they are surrounded by). In some places, this is known as ‘empathy’.
To many the concept sounds so trite it shouldn’t require mentioning.
Unfortunately the plethora of ‘bad’ designs in the world suggests that problem
solvers (or more likely the system they are constrained to work within) do not
adopt this position as a matter of normal or even occasional practice.</p>
<p>Airports perhaps provide a good example. Most of the systems known as
‘airport’ appear to have little to do with empathy with the customer. This is
especially unfortunate when thinking about airports we might visit in other
countries for that establishment gives us our fast and last impression of the
country. Anyone unfortunate enough to have to use airports a lot will probably
feel that they are very much part of a super-system which has little to do with
the smooth running of the airport designed by the architects and managers who
organize how they operate. </p>
<p>What if there was a better way? What if the architects and managers saw
things from the perspectives of the super-system?</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Would they think it was a good use of passengers’ time to have them
  sitting doing nothing in a departure lounge and then moving them on to an
  aeroplane to do more nothing for several hours and then force them to endure
  another possibly several hours (a tie between Moscow and Atlanta for this
  author) passing through immigration?</li>
  <li>Would they recognize that passenger consumption of electrical power - for
  laptops, phones, personal stereos, etc - has risen phenomenally in the past
  five years but that battery power hasn’t matched the change? There are a host
  of passengers who would love (and may even be willing to pay for) recharging
  facilities.</li>
  <li>Would they recognize that more and more passengers are more and more
  likely to use carry-on luggage and are therefore less and less likely to want
  to check their baggage if they can possibly help it? </li>
  <li>Would they recognize that many business travellers travel to get to
  meetings and that these travellers would be as happy to have that meeting at
  the airport as locating appropriate ground transportation (in an unfamiliar
  location) to get them to a meeting somewhere else?</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. Not to mention the ‘empathy’ discussions we might get into if we
refocused on the system (‘instrument of torture’?) known as the airliner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Standing In The Future And Looking To The Present</p>
</b>
<p>A current favourite example of this kind of empathy comes from a possibly
apocryphal, but nevertheless hopefully instructive tale relayed at a recent
architecture conference. The story relates to an architect appointed by NASA to
help think about the design of a possible future manned base on Mars. Such a job
no doubt presents an architect with an incredibly enticing combination of
freedom and new design challenges - with a good many of the boundary conditions
found on earth (gravity, temperature range, atmosphere, etc) considerably
altered. The architect concerned apparently reveled in the challenge and was
very proud to eventually unveil his design solutions to all and sundry. Among
the audience were some astronauts. They were not too enamoured of the chosen
solution, however, especially since at no stage during the design process had
they or the equipment they would be wearing been included. Funny but
unfortunately also common (one famous architect - a different one by the way -
has been quoted on more than one occasion as saying customers should not expect
the structures he designs to be functional; his first and foremost role is to
make a ‘statement’. Oh dear.)</p>
<p>Other examples of benefits accruable from problem solvers standing in the
future and looking back - just about every recycling issue currently known
(“your customers are your grandchildren”), changing demographics (what will I
think about the pension system in twenty years time when I might actually become
the recipient?), maintenance issues (this author has direct personal experience
of designing small components and their ability to be maintained in the field
only to find out when actually out in the field that it could be -30°C and the
operators are wearing inch thick mittens on their hands), and, thinking about
future super-system, a whole host of contradictions that emerge as different
parts of society evolve at different rates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
</b>
<p>In its original form, the 9-Windows system operator, whether intentionally or
otherwise, separates us from the problem; we are encouraged to see it from
‘outside’ each of the windows; we look into the windows. On some occasions this
can be a very useful position to hold. On others, however, it separates us from
the problem in a harmful way.</p>
<p>The SLP tool is a way of getting ourselves to become a part of the problem,
but it only does so at the sub-system level; we become part of the sub-system
and view the bigger picture from that perspective.</p>
<p>We have hopefully seen that there is value in placing ourselves ‘inside’ the
other windows (‘rooms’) in the tool, and that our viewing perspective can have a
significant influence on both the problems we define and the solutions we reach.</p>
<p>In the next installment of this series of articles exploring the system
operator, we will be following one of the TRIZ evolution trends and examining
the implications and opportunities arising when we explicitly add a third
dimension to the 9-Windows.</p>
