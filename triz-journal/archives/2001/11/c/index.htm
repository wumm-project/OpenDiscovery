<p>Introduction</p>
</font></b>
<p>In this article, we draw comparisons between TRIZ and the tools and
strategies contained in Taguchi methods. Our aim is to identify areas of common
ground and differences between the two approaches which might enable users of
TRIZ to benefit from the findings of Taguchi methods. For those requiring a
basic introduction to Taguchi Methods, we recommend (1).</p>

<p>[1] Factor Effect Plots in relation to TRIZ Contradictions</p>
</font>
<dir>
  </b>
  <p>(a) Technical Contradictions :</p>
  <p>Referring to Fig 1, </p>
  <p>A2 <font FACE="Wingdings">à</font> Nominal value of Control Factor A</p>
  <p>If A2 <font FACE="Wingdings">à</font> A1, then QC2 improves but QC1 worsens</p>
  <p>If A2 <font FACE="Wingdings">à</font> A3, then QC1 improves but QC2 worsens</p>
</dir>
<font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="01.gif" width="250" height="316"></p>
<p align="left">Fig 1. Factor Effect Plots for 2 Quality Characteristics, QC1
and QC2</p>
</b></font>
<dir>
  <p>This points clearly to a “Technical Contradiction” between features QC1 and
  QC2. This connection between hyperbolic profile curves and technical
  contradictions has previously been described in Reference (2) for cases in
  which QC1 and QC2 are drawn on the two axes of the same graph. The connection
  with Taguchi factor effect plots hopefully serves to re-enforce the connection
  between this curve shape and the existence of technical contradictions.</p>
  <p>(b) Physical Contradictions :</p>
  <p>Referring to the top part of Fig 2: </p>
  <p>Best Value of QC is found at parameter setting A2 </p>
  <p>If A2 <font FACE="Wingdings">à</font> A1 or A2 <font FACE="Wingdings">à</font>
  A3, then QC worsens</p>
  <p>This clearly points to the fact that A2 is the best setting of parameter A</p>
  <p>Referring to the bottom part of the figure.</p>
  <p>Taguchi Statement : Best settings could be A1 or A3</p>
  <p>TRIZ statement : For best QC, A should be low as well as high</p>
  <p>This clearly points to a “Physical Contradiction”. The Feature associated
  with this contradiction is A. Again this parabolic-like graph shape has
  previously been seen to relate the existence of a physical contradiction - as
  described in Reference 1.</p>
  <font SIZE="2"><b>
  <p align="left"><img border="0" src="02.gif" width="249" height="316"></p>
</dir>
<p align="left">Fig 2. Factor Effect Plots for QC</p>
</b></font><b>
</b>
<p>The Taguchi method points out clearly the technical and physical
contradictions and thus helps TRIZ in the sense that identification of the
problem becomes easy. TRIZ tools can then be applied to resolve the
contradictions. Exactly in the opposite way, the innovative solution concepts of
TRIZ can be verified, evaluated, implemented by planning an experiment where
parameter settings can be optimized and best process can be selected.</p>
<b><font COLOR="#000080">
<p>[2] S/N Ratio (Objective Function) and relations to TRIZ</p>
</font></b>
<p>Taguchi methods are experimental statistical methods to optimize a given
process technology with respect to an objective function defined as</p>
<p><img border="0" src="03.gif" width="373" height="57"></p>
<font SIZE="2"><b>
</b></font>
<p>Variance is in fact reduced in presence of noise (variations in the control
parameters of the process) and thus the product/process becomes “robust” and
“low cost”. For both Taguchi and TRIZ the Ideal Value is <font FACE="Symbol">¥</font>
(infinity). </p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>(a) Since the ideal value is <font FACE="Symbol">¥</font> (infinity), the
    primary importance is shifted from “improving mean” (as in the conventional
    approach) to “reduction in Variance” to 0 (zero).</p>
    <p>(b) Identify an “adjustment factor” that has little or no effect on the
    variance but has a large effect on the mean</p>
    <font FACE="Wingdings">
    <p>à</font> use the adjustment factor to “put” the “mean-on-target”</p>
  </dir>
  <b>
  <p>COMPARISON with TRIZ :</p>
  <dir>
    </b>
    <p>(a) Objective functions of Taguchi Method, also called ‘Signal-to-Noise
    Ratios’ (S/N Ratios). While these objective functions bear little relation
    to the concept of ‘define the IFR and work back from it’ found in TRIZ, they
    are <u>similar</u> to the “Ideal Final Result” of TRIZ in the sense of
    providing a measure of system ideality: Improvement in S/N ratio takes us
    closer to the IFR. </p>
    <p>(b) In TRIZ, there are two main ways of moving an existing system forward
    towards ideality</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p>(i) ‘improving’ partial or inefficient useful action </p>
        <p>(ii) ‘eliminating’ harmful action/effects </p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>Both directions can be achieved using the S-Fields and Trends parts of
    the TRIZ toolkit.</p>
    <p>Harmful action can be eliminated in 3 possible ways,</p>
    <dir>
      <p>1. Eliminate the “root” cause (of harmful action)</p>
      <p>2. Eliminate the harmful “action” itself</p>
      <p>3. Eliminate the “effects” of the harmful action</p>
    </dir>
    <p>The “root” cause identification and elimination is ‘idealistic’ and so is
    removal of “action’ itself. Many times, this changes the S-Field model or
    its implementation completely. </p>
    <p>So, we look for more practical approach for eliminating the “harmful
    effect” while allowing the harm causing action to persist! (It may be
    performing some useful function). THIS is the core principle of Taguchi
    Method and ROBUST design. <font COLOR="#800000">Thus, Option-3 matches well
    with the Taguchi Method.</p>

<p>In the very simplest terms, the link between TRIZ and Taguchi comes in the
interface between having the idea and turning into a robust reality. TRIZ
continues to be unique in it’s ability to help problem solvers generate good
solution ideas (all other methods feature the ‘insert miracle here’ moment when
it comes to the part of the systematic problem solving process that involves
creation of ideas); Taguchi has near similar uniqueness when it comes to
transforming the idea into effective outcome. Links between the two methods have
been explored before (3), but, we hope we’ve begun to demonstrate here, there is
still much ground to be covered before the two methods are generating the
synergistic benefits we firmly believe are there waiting to be taken. We will
return, in particular, to the implications and opportunities for benefit when
TRIZ exploits non-linearities in a future article.</p>
