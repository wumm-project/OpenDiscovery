  Grace told us that he wanted to tell the story of introducing TRIZ to his
  company, but keep the company’s name private. We thought that the story was
  interesting for our readers, but we asked for some information, so that
  readers could compare their own companies to Frank’s. Here is the background:
  </font><i><font color="#008080">The company is a nonwoven/textile finisher,
  coater, and laminator providing specialized composite materials for a wide
  range of industries from automotive to apparel. There are approximately 80
  employees in two locations in the United States, one in the South and the
  other on the East Coast. Many employees hold degrees ranging from textile
  chemistry to operations management. Over 70% of the company's employees have
  been with the company for more than 20 years. Our annual US sales are 95% and
  we sell about 5% export. We have been ISO 9001:94 registered since 1997 and
  are currently in the process of working towards the high automotive quality
  standard known as QS-9000.</font></p>

<p>In the Fall 2000 semester at North Carolina State University, I had the honor
of taking a distance learning course entitled TE 589A - TRIZ (The Theory of
Inventive Problem Solving). Dr. Michael S. Slocum provided the televised
lectures for the course and Dr. Timothy G. Clapp provided support during the
semester via email.</p>
<p>For a more detailed study on what the class covered please see Drs. Slocum
and Clapp’s articles published in the TRIZ Journal:</p>
<p>November 1998 - <i>Theory of Inventive Problem Solving Pedagogy in
Engineering Education, Part I</p>
</i>
<p>December 2000 - <i>Theory of Inventive Problem Solving Pedagogy in
Engineering Education, Part II</p>

<b>
<p>My First Impression of TRIZ:</p>
</b>
<p>When I first received the syllabus for the course it stated that “This class
<i>will</i> change the way you solve problems”. To be honest my initial reaction
was “Yeah, right!” Little did I know that I was demonstrating my own
psychological inertia before the course even began. I had never heard of TRIZ
before signing up for the class. If I had never heard of it, how could it be
that good?</p>
<p>I work full time for a small company where we deal with plant problems on a
daily basis. Sometimes there seems to be so many problems that occur so often
that we are constantly “putting out fires”. It gets to the point that we now
call solving a problem “fire fighting”. With this background, I decided to give
the course a chance and see what it could teach me.</p>
<p>The outcome of the course culminated in a class project entitled “<i>A New
TRIZ Practitioner’s Experience for Solving an Industrial Problem using ARIZ 85C:
Increasing a Textile Kiss-Coat Operation Speed</i>” where using ARIZ I was able
to solve a major problem our company had been facing for quite some time. The
full paper can be found on the TRIZ Journal Archives in the January 2001
section. I also was able to solve other problems by using such TRIZ tools as the
Contradiction Matrix and the Separation Principles. Needless to say that TRIZ
has changed the way I look at problems and solve them. It has given me great
confidence in tackling problems in the company that have been classified as
“impossible to solve” because “we’ve tried everything”.</p>
<b>
<p>Introducing TRIZ to my company:</p>
</b>
<p>After the course was completed, I decided to spread the word throughout the
company to see if there was interest in the company as a whole learning about
TRIZ. There was and the company’s CEO asked that I teach an introductory class
on some of the basic principles of TRIZ.</p>
<p>Although I am not a TRIZ master I was persuaded to put together a small
seminar with upper and lower management and introduced them to TRIZ with the aid
of the course notes that were provided by Dr. Clapp. I covered such topics as
the Contradiction Matrix, Separation Principles, Inventive Levels of Solutions,
and Psychological Inertia. I also included small exercises and broke the class
up into groups. In one exercise I had them identify where the where the 40
principles are used in the company.</p>
<b>
<p>Using the Contradiction Matrix in the Seminar:</p>
</b>
<p>Another exercise I had the class do was to solve a company problem using the
Contradiction Matrix. The class was broken into two groups and they separately
came up with solutions to the problem that was posed. To my surprised (and to
theirs) both groups came up with the same solution!</p>
<b>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
</b>
<p>As a company, we have assembled a Problem Solving Team. This team includes
the members of our ISO 9001/QS 9000 Correction Action team. We have tied in both
teams and have started to use TRIZ tools to solve company problems. We are
seeing problems being solved and the manner in which we solve problems is
changing. We now discuss problems by identifying where the technical or physical
contradictions are and I can actually see the level of inventiveness improving.
People are starting to identify their own and other people’s psychological
inertia. The “fire fighting” is being reduced. It’s an exciting time!</p>

<p>The Seminar’s Feedback:</p>
</b>
<p>After the seminar, I had the attendees fill out a questionnaire to get their
feedback on their feelings of what the learned. You can find the results below:</p>

</font><i>
<p align="left">July 2001</p>

</p><ol>
  <li>Where do you think TRIZ can play a major role in our ISO-9001/QS-9000
  quality system?</li>
</ol>
<i>
</p><ul>
  <li>Help Solve Technical Contradictions, solutions to FMEA’s</li>
  <li>All aspects of the system</li>
  <li>Constant improvement and progressive thinking</li>
  <li>Organize our approach to problem solving as ISO organized the way we do
  what we do</li>
  <li>We can utilize TRIZ in our Corrective/Preventative Action process as well
  as use it as a toll in continuous improvement, hopefully eliminating the
  “Trial &amp; Error” portions of our daily existence</li>
  <li>Getting to root cause and CAR’s (Corrective Actions), continuous
  improvement</li>
  <li>To look at problems, processes etc. in a different way</li>
</ul>
</i>
<ol start="2">
  <li>How do you think the TRIZ method of tackling problems is different from
  the way we currently solve most problems at our Company today?</li>
</ol>
<dir>
  <i>
  <li>It pulls us in the right direction using generic problems that have
  already been solved instead of guessing using Trial &amp; Error or placing
  band-aides on problems.</li>
  <li>Quicker way of getting to root causes than Trial &amp; Error</li>
  <li>It will stop a lot of Trial &amp; Error, save time and money</li>
  <li>We would normally use the Trial &amp; Error methods coupled with our inherent
  psychological inertia. TRIZ opens up a new way of looking at problems that we
  normally would not do.</li>
  <li>By using an already established group of inventions (solutions) and
  finding how they would best apply to our problem, we eliminate much Trial &amp;
  Error</li>
  <li>We use Trial &amp; Error and have many psychological barriers</li>
  <li>It presents us with a different approach or tool to problem solving. It
  eliminates or reduces the problem with heading in many different directions</li>
  <li>New way of looking at attempting to solve a problem</li>
  <li>People need to change their way of thinking, try looking forward instead
  of always behind</li>
  <li>Yes, now mostly Trial &amp; Error, we be “general” solution &amp; error!!</li>

<ol start="3">
  <li>What did you find was the most interesting part of learning about TRIZ and
  what do you think will be the most helpful tool?</li>
</ol>
<dir>
  <i>
  <li>Looking at the problem solution at a high enough abstraction to get rid of
  noise or Psychological Inertia</li>
  <li>Breaking down an actual problem, re-figuring it and also including your
  preventative action when deciding what can go wrong if correcting something</li>
  <li>The table showing historical generic solutions, it works!!!</li>
  <li>A better way of solving problems</li>
  <li>That it is being used by others and it will allow us to think outside the
  box</li>
  <li>That creativity is not really “creative”. Its actually a learned
  step-by-step process</li>
  <li>The way it helps break down P.I.</li>
  <li>It makes you think outside the box</li>
  <li>Both groups came up with the same solution to speeding up the machine</li>
  <li>Was that anyone could use TRIZ to solve problems; you don’t need a college
  degree to use it or solve problems with it.</li>
  </i>
</dir>
<ol start="4">
  <li>What negatives, if any, do you foresee in getting everyone to use TRIZ
  tools at our Company?</li>
</ol>
<dir>
  <i>
  <li>Psychological Inertia</li>
  <li>I do not see any big problem, only we need to inform people and help them
  get out of their old ways of thinking</li>
  <li>Their P.I., also most people will feel they do not have the time to invest
  in it</li>
  <li>Setting aside time to use the system properly</li>
  <li>None, just another tool for solving problems</li>
  <li>Negativity (people’s feelings)</li>
  </i>
</dir>
<ol start="5">
  <li>What positives, if any, do you foresee in getting everyone to use TRIZ
  tools at our Company?</li>
</ol>
<dir>
  <i>
  <li>Less noise, overcome psychological inertia</li>
  <li>Change for the better</li>
  <li>A creative way to start solving problems</li>
  <li>There is a great advantage to having someone from within present a new
  concept versus an outsider</li>
  <li>Thinking outside the box</li>
  <li>Faster more efficient problem solving, enabling people to be more open
  minded</li>
  <li>Eliminated the wasted trials we are so accustomed to running and hopefully
  get us to the root causes of some of our major issues</li>
  <li>It looks like the way of the future to solve problems. It will save us
  time and money, it will pull us ahead of everyone</li>
  <li>Maybe we can stop putting out fires and finally solve some problems</li>
  <li>Changing the way people think to benefit the company as a whole</li>
  </i>
</dir>
<ol start="6">
  <li>Do you have any suggestions that will help or make it easier to implement
  using TRIZ at our Company? What are they?</li>
</ol>
<dir>
  <i>
  <li>The more people who practice using it, the easier this will become,
  example: presenting a problem once a week or monthly and let employees solve
  the problem</li>
  <li>Make it part of everyday life, use it in a team form when solving any
  problems, do not let it become just another problem solving class we’ve all
  taken</li>
  <li>Just that we should use it, the more we make it our daily work, the better
  we will get at it</li>
  <li>Select some product development projects and do TRIZ before</li>
  <li>Remind people they’re never too old to learn!</li>
  <li>Formally use it with teams involving operations and management</li>
