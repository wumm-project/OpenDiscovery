<p>1. Abstract</p>
</font></b>
<p>“Solve World Hunger” is frequently used as an example of an unsolvable
problem. But, TRIZ can generate creative, practical, realistic ways of solving
many of the components of the problem of world hunger. Specifically, more than
40% of the food that is produced does not reach the people or animals for which
it is intended. This will be used as a case study to demonstrate the use of
Su-Field modeling and the 76 Standard Solutions, using a variety of different
constraints for different conditions around the world.</p>
<p>The flow chart shown in Figure 1 will be used as the basis for the case
study, to illustrate how each of the 5 classes of the 76 Standard Solutions is
used. Various aspects of the food provision (production/protection/distribution)
problem will be explored.</p>

<p>2. Introduction</p>
</font></b>
<p>The 76 Standard Solutions (Ref. 1) are not new to the TRIZ community. As a
collection of methods to identify and apply proven problem-solving templates,
they can help the TRIZ practioner find solutions concepts for many kinds of
problems. The Standard Solutions are grouped by constraints, so they can help
the practioners find appropriate solution concepts quickly. They are more
accessible to TRIZ newcomers than ARIZ, since the user is liberated from the
ARIZ dictum of mastering every step before using any step. They are among the
fundamental techniques that provide the foundation for all three commercial
software products (Refs.2, 3, 4) that are used in conjunction with TRIZ. But,
judging from the case study presentations at earlier conferences (Refs. 5, 6)
the 76 Standard Solutions are not currently being used widely (in the
English-speaking TRIZ community) for problem solving.</p>
<p>People learning TRIZ need case studies that illustrate the principles of TRIZ
using terms and technologies that are familiar to them. The problem of providing
food around the world is used to illustrate the application of the 76 Standard
Solutions because it involves many technologies at many different levels of
development, and requires the application of a wide range of technical,
political, social and cultural constraints. It therefore provides a large family
of problems that can help many people learn how to apply the 76 Standard
Solutions, and it simultaneously offers an opportunity for the TRIZ community to
contribute to improving global welfare. We note this topic should be discussed
with a sense of caution. It is an arena where seemingly small changes can have
extensive effects. Potential effects on people, animals, and eco-systems should
always be examined with great care.</p>

<p>The 76 Standard Solutions</p>
</b>
<p>The “76 Standard Solutions” of TRIZ were compiled by G.S. Altshuller and
his associates between 1975 and 1985. They are grouped into 5 large categories
or classes as follows:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <td>1. Improving the system with no or little change</td>
    <td>13 standard solutions</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Improving the system by changing the system</td>
    <td>23 standard solutions</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3. System transitions</td>
    <td>6 standard solutions</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4. Detection and measurement</td>
    <td>17 standard solutions</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5. Strategies for simplification and improvement</td>
    <td>17 standard solutions</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="right">Total:</td>
    <td>76 standard solutions</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The standards may be used as templates to which problems may be matched: They
provide a concise description of the generic situation and generally include a
statement of high-level constraints or restrictions.</p>
<p>Typically, the 76 standard solutions are used as a step in ARIZ, after the
Su-field model has been developed and any constraints on the solution have been
identified. The model and the constraints are used to identify the class and the
specific solution. The 76 Standard Solutions can have broader application
outside ARIZ, and can be used especially in those situations where a rudimentary
model of the system can be developed. This model may be in classical Su-field
format, or may follow a simple functional analysis approach. The approach can
also be useful when there is no technical or physical contradiction observed.</p>
<p>The solutions in classes 1-4 frequently make the system more complicated,
since many of them require the introduction of new materials or new fields. The
solutions in Class 5 are methods for simplifying the system, making it more
ideal. After deciding on a solution from classes 1-3 for a performance problem
or class 4 for a measurement or detection problem, use class 5 to simplify the
solution. See Figure 1 for a flowchart showing in more detail the use of the
various classes of the 76 standard solutions for both problem solving and
technology forecasting.</p>
<p>Generally accessible English language references with listings and
explanation of the 76 Standard Solutions have recently become available. (Refs.
1, 7, 8, 9) They have also been compared and cross-referenced to the Inventive
Principles (Ref. 10) and to other TRIZ Heuristics. (Ref. 9)</p>
<b>
<p>Details of Flow Chart</p>
</b>
<p>The flow chart organizes use of the 76 Standard solutions into three main
pathways: System Improvement, solutions for Measurement and Detection, and use
of the Standard Solutions for Forecasting opportunities for change. The System
Improvement pathway typically begins with creation of a Su-Field Model of the
specific problem system. Alternate pathways are then followed depending on
whether system interactions are absent, inadequate, or even harmful.</p>
<p>Measurement and Detection applications are addressed by a single class of
standards that begins with doing no measurement or detection at all and
progresses through application of ferromagnetic particles and fields to system
transitions and evolution.</p>
<p>The Forecasting branch provides an approach to address possible changes to a
system, even when there is no specific need for improvement. Either or both
minimal change and system change to the sub or super system may be considered.</p>
<p>All three principal pathways provide for further refinement of the solution,
refinement of the problem statement and iterative application of the standards,
and ultimately for use of Class 5: Strategies for simplification and
improvement.</p>
<p>Three widely varied areas or segments of the World Food Supply Issue will be
explored in the remainder of this article to illustrate use of the 76 Standard
Solutions along these pathways. The examples in each of these segments are based
on recent developments in the food provision process and the technologies and
information systems that support it. Many of these systems, and the specific
examples provided, are in flux. The actual consequences of some of these
technology examples may be adverse and are still to be determined in the real
world. The Standard Solutions in Class 5: Strategies for simplification and
improvement, may be especially important for assuring that actions taken on
these systems are well thought out.</p>

<p>4. The World Food Supply --- What is the problem?</p>
</font></b><b>
<p>What is the hunger problem?</p>
</b>
<p>Nobody denies that hunger is a problem in our world today. Every year, hunger
and the diseases associated with it kill 12 million children under the age of 5<sup><a href="#1" name="1a">1</a></sup>.
At the same time, we are a world that produces enough food to feed everyone
amply, even while vast quantities of food are wasted<sup><a href="#2" name="2a">2</a></sup>.
There are many excellent organizations worldwide that are involved in generating
solutions to this complex problem.</p>
<p>Example: Hewlett-Packard advertisement in 12-18-2000 Business Week Magazine.
100 billion pounds of food goes to waste in the US each year, and 31 million
people go hungry. One problem is lack of communication. ResourceLink.org
connects food manufacturers with Second Harvest and with trucking companies and
other shippers. (<u><font color="#0000ff">www.resourcelink.hp.com &lt;http://www.resourcelink.hp.com&gt;</font></u>)</p>
<p>So while hunger, on a worldwide basis, can be addressed as the result of
production problems, it can also be addressed as supply, distribution,
information, and many other types of more specific problems.</p>
<p>To address these myriad problems, and to help define the “Zone of the
Problem” and the specific elements of the sub-systems we can improve, measure,
or make predictions about, we developed a focusing tool in the form of a
foodstuff lifecycle review.</p>
<p>Lifecycle stages were defined as:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><font size="2">DEMAND (Diet, Economics)</font></td>
    <td>
      <p><font size="2">PRODUCTION (Growing, Harvesting)</font></td>
    <td>
      <p><font size="2">DISTRIBUTION (Transportation, Storage)</font></td>
    <td>
      <p><font size="2">CONVERSION/ PREPARATION (Acquiring, Processing, Storage)</font></td>
    <td>
      <p><font size="2">UTILIZATION (Over / Under) (Delivery, Cooking,
      Consumption)</font></td>
    <td>
      <p><font size="2">DISPOSAL (Foodstuffs, Ancillary Materials)</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>And as any particular problem was identified by brainstorming and other
means, we identified it as a problem of Efficiency, Effectiveness, or
Capacity/Capability. An abbreviated example table of this Lifecycle model is
shown as Figure 2. This table proved very useful in identifying tangible
portions of the overall food provision and consumption system. Those tangible
portions or elements were much more amenable to focusing on the zone of the
problem and subsequent problem formulation. Entries are labeled “A” for
those to be treated as system improvements, “B” for those to be addressed by
through the measurement / detection standards, and “C” for those to be
addressed for forecasting.</p>

<p>5. Case Study Illustrative Applications</p>
</font></b><b><i>
<p>Case A. System Improvement Pathway - Illustrative Example: Insect Damage to
Grain.</p>
</i></b>
<p>Insect damage is a major source of loss of food. By some estimates, insects
and vermin together destroy 25% of the grain that is harvested. A separate
problem is the destruction of crops in the field by insects, either by damaging
the grain, or by damaging the plant that produces the grain. The first problem,
insects eating stored grain, is an important problem and an excellent
illustration of the System Improvement branch of the 76 Standard Solutions flow
chart.</p>
<p>Following the flow chart explicitly, at the step “Focus on the Zone of the
Problem,” there are several possibilities, as follows:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>The grain has been harvested and is not yet infested with insects</li>
  <li>Insects are in the grain, eating it</li>
  <li>Insects have been in the grain for some time, and have deposited their
    eggs in the grain.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first problem is an example of System Improvement when the interaction is
“absent”-that is, there is an incomplete Su-field model, with one object,
with nothing acting on it.</p>
<b>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="04.gif" width="133" height="106"><br>
FIGURE 4 Unprotected Grain</p>
</b>
<p>Follow the route shown in Figure 1 for “Interaction is Absent”, to the
solutions of Class 1.1, which says, “If there is only an object S<sub>1</sub>,
add a second object S2 and an interaction (field) F.” In this case the obvious
solution is to add something to protect the grain from insects, such as a grain
storage bin. We show this schematically with a method of drawing models which is
a derivative of the method developed by Zinovy Royzen as explained in J.
Terninko’s February 2000 article in Ref. 1. See also Z. Royzen, “Tool,
Object, Product (TOP) Function Analysis. “ September 1999 TRIZ Journal (Ref.
11)</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="05.gif" width="570" height="127"><br>
<b>FIGURE 5 Grain Storage</b></p>
<p>The next step in this path in Figure 1 is “Use Class 3 to refine the
Solution” and in Class 3 we find a variety of system transition suggestions,
such as the creation of the bi-system, which could lead to the idea of a storage
bin which both protects from insects and dispenses the grain.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="06.gif" width="170" height="127"><br>
<b>FIGURE 6 Grain Storage Bin</b></p>
<p>Next, the flow chart asks if this solution concept is sufficient. If it is,
could it be more ideal? This continues the path for System Improvement. The bin,
if properly constructed, is adequate to protect the grain from insect
infestation, but it is not very good for releasing the grain. Class 5 is used to
make the solution concept more ideal.</p>
<p>Solution 5.1 deals with introducing substances, 5.1.1 is indirect ways of
introducing substances, and 5.1.1.1 is the use of “nothing” such as voids,
vacuum, holes, air, hollows, clearances, etc. This stimulates the idea of using
an airspace to make it easier to dispense the grain, by lifting the bin off the
ground.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="07.gif" width="431" height="165"><br>
<b>FIGURE 7 Modern Grain Storage Bin</b></p>
<p>If the insects are already in the grain before it is stored, eating the
grain, the Su-field model is the harmful interaction model as shown:</p>
<p align="left"><b><img border="0" src="08.gif" width="511" height="134"><br>
FIGURE 8 Infested Grain</b></p>
<p>In this case, use the branch of the flow chart shown in figure 1 as “Interaction
is Harmful”, which leads to Class 1.2, “Eliminating or neutralizing harmful
effects.” Solution 1.2.1 says that if S2 and S1 do not have to be in contact,
introduce S3. (Note: in the classical situation there are both useful and
harmful effects. In this case, the insects do nothing useful, but they are
there. So, eliminating them entirely is another option.) S3 could be an
insecticide that kills the insects but does not harm the grain, and does not
affect humans or animals. Methyl bromide is the most commonly used substance for
this purpose, but it is thought to be harmful to the ozone layer, and
considerable research is underway to find substitutes. Phosphine gas has shown
promise against such pests as the lesser grain borer, the rice weevil, and the
rusty grain beetle.</p>
<p>Alternatively, solution 1.2.2 applies to the same situation, but in
circumstances where new substances cannot be added, and suggests that either S1
or S2 should be modified. The grain can be modified to taste bad to the insects.
Note that time sequence is important when suggesting these solutions. If the
insects are actively eating the grain, this solution won’t work. If certain
kinds of insects are common in an area, and the farmers in that area plant grain
that tastes bad to the insects, then this solution concept is not only useful,
it is ideal-the grain protects itself, provided that the nutritional value of
the grain is maintained.</p>
<p>Another approach is the creation of grain that kills the insects by
interfering with their metabolism. Corn has been developed that has the protein
avidin, which binds the vitamin biotin. Insects cannot convert their food to
energy without biotin, so they suffer delayed development and death. This
approach has been effective with maise weevils, indianmeal moths, Mediterranean
flour moths, and others.</p>
<p>Research is also underway in several areas that could be described as “modifying”
the insects, by infecting them with any of a variety of parasites and fungi. The
wasp Habrobracon hebetor, for example, attacks the indiameal moth and its
larvae, but does not harm the grain.</p>
<p>Solution 1.2.3 specifies the situation where a field causes the harmful
action, and suggests introducing an element S3 to absorb the harmful effects.
This could work regardless of the time sequence. If the aroma of the grain
attracts the insects, introduce a material that absorbs or neutralizes the
aroma. Alternatively, introduce something that interferes with the insects’
ability to smell the grain. Odor neutralizers are being developed now for use
against the red flour beetle.</p>
<p>Following the harmful interaction path on Figure 1, use Class 3 to refine any
of these solution concepts. For the first example, using a chemical insecticide,
Solution 3.2.1 suggests transition to a micro-level, which includes replacing
objects by fields. A variety of fields can be used to kill insects, including
ultraviolet and infrared radiation, heat, and ultrasound, depending on the
species of insect. Heat treatment above 55oC is a promising alternative to the
use of methyl bromide.</p>
<p>The path then continues through the decision whether the solution concept is
sufficient, to reformulation of the problem if it is not, or use of Class 5 to
make the solution more ideal, or use of the solution if the solution concept is
adequate. In this case, solution 5.1.1.1, the use of nothing, sounds like a
useful idea. Vacuum could be used to kill the insects, by pumping the air out of
the container.</p>
<p>This method is used on ships to kill rodents, but it has mixed success in
killing insects, since some species can endure long periods without breathing,
and have hard shells that protect them from the effects of depressurization. An
alternative is to pressurize the area with CO2 to drive out the oxygen, killing
the insects by suffocation. As with all TRIZ solutions, detailed data are needed
to validate any suggestion derived from the 76 Standard Solutions.</p>
<p>The relative level of ideality must also be tested. The cost of the vacuum
pump and the energy to run it might be more than the cost of the lights or heat
or ultrasound generator suggested in Class 3, or of the chemical insecticide
from Class 1. Certainly the light, sound, and vacuum or CO2 solution concepts
have the advantage of not leaving chemical residues that might harm the people
or animals that eat the grain or of dissipation into the atmosphere. The
Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) can be used to measure relative Ideality of
solution concepts. This method allows considering several criteria for selection
simultaneously. (Ref. 12)</p>
<p>Another Class 5 solution concept with no residues is from solution 5.3.3,
using the phenomena that accompany a phase change. In this example, lowering the
temperature of the grain below freezing will kill most insects when the water in
their cells freezes, rupturing the cell membranes due to the expansion of water
when it becomes ice. Once again the cost of the freezing mechanism and the
energy to operate it must be compared to the cost of alternate methods to
determine if an increase in ideality has in fact been achieved.</p>

<p><b>Case B. Measurement and Detection Pathway - Illustrative Examples: Soil
Fertility and Plant Genetic Modification.</b></p>
<p>System to be improved: Agricultural Production of Major Foodstuffs</p>
<p>Initial Problem Statement: Can soil fertility be enhanced and made to improve
the overall effectivness of food production, especially for growing grains such
as wheat, barley, soybeans, etc?</p>
<p>In the grain production areas of the U.S. and Canada, almost all grains are
produced in very large fields, with extensive use of fertilizers and
herbicides/pesticides. The maximum yield to be expected from each crop is
determined by the plant genetics. It is known that increasing the gross amounts
of fertilizers is effective up to a limit; beyond that limit further application
may be wasteful and may even become counterproductive. Some farmers are
beginning to see the need for increased fertilization to maintain yields because
of soil deterioration. It is also known that there are localized variations of
soil condition, microclimate, moisture levels, etc, within each field. These
localized variations may occur over areas as small as a few square feet, or as
large as several acres. Thus, the actual localized yields of grain may vary
significantly within a field. Historically, fertilizers have been applied at a
uniform rate across an entire field, and yields have been reported only in the
aggregate, e.g. bushels/acre. The result of these practices is that some areas
of a field may receive more fertilizer than is necessary, while other local
areas may not receive enough.</p>
<p>Modern large-scale farm equipment provides a variety of ways to apply seed,
fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Many of these provide means to vary the
application rate (pounds/acre) almost continuously as the appliance traverses
the field, or they at least provide for frequent adjustment. Various
fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides may be applied up to seven or eight
months before seeding, at the exact time of seeding, or during plant growth.</p>
<p>Large-scale harvesting of grain is done with “Combines” which cut the
plant stalks, separate the individual kernels of grain from the plant head, and
accumulate the kernels for transfer to a transport means for storage. These
devices frequently include the means to measure the bulk yield, in bushels, as
crops are harvested. Harvesting is done some four to five months after seeding.</p>
<p>To follow our flow chart and “Focus on the Zone of the Problem”, it is
clear that the pertinent events occur over long time cycles, and the problem may
be reformulated as an issue of:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Determining and recording the actual localized yield for each specific
    location in or area of a field,</li>
  <li>Determining the desired amounts of fertilizer, herbicides, and pesticides
    to apply to those specific areas,</li>
  <li>Controlling the application rate to the desired area.</li>
</ol>
<p>To re-state the problem: How to match the localized availability of
agricultural additives and treatments to a plant’s genetic ability to utilize
them throughout the growth cycle.</p>
<p>Thus, our analysis has clarified the immediate need: to achieve or improve
the measurement and / or detection methods for very localized grain yields and
fertilizer and additives application. This directs us to apply Class 4,
Measurement and Detection Standards.</p>
<p>The Resources Listing for this problem is extensive. An initial listing
focuses on the resources immediately available to the farmer:</p>

</div>
<p>We will see below through our application of the Standards of Class 4 that
there are actually additional resources routinely available to the farmer.</p>
<p>An initial Su Field Model is thus:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="09.gif" width="594" height="123"><br>
<b>FIGURE 9 Grain Production</b></p>
<p>And we desire to transform this model as follows:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="10.gif" width="600" height="134"><br>
<b>FIGURE 10 Grain Production</b></p>
<p>The standards in Class 4 offer us the following guides:</p>
<p>Standard Class 4.1. Indirect Methods</p>
<p>Standard 4.1.1. suggests we modify the system instead of detecting or
measuring so there is no longer a need for measurement.</p>
<p>This is in effect the original approach to fertilizer applications; simply
apply what fertilizers are available, and in the available amounts, with the
available equipment. If the results are economically satisfactory, there is no
need to perform measurement upon which more precise or sophisticated
fertilization or soil treatment could be based.</p>
<p>Alternatively, this standard could lead to modification of the seed stocks
themselves for the purpose of increased yield in low fertility conditions. This
is in fact being done extensively through plant genetics, hybridization and
genetic engineering.</p>
<p>Standard 4.1.2. suggests measuring a copy or an image, if 4.1.1 can’t be
used. Satellite Infrared photographic images of agricultural areas are used to
estimate the density and extent of actual plant growth. These images can be
measured to a fairly small scale and results correlated to previous applications
of fertilizing and/or other remedial agents. For wide spread use, this procedure
might require a rapid process time to make “real-time” information available
to the farmer. Further, it is expensive since it requires the acquisition and
transmission of large amounts of image data.</p>
<p>Standard 4.1.3. suggests use 2 detections instead of continuous measurement,
if 4.1.1 or 4.1.2 cannot be used. This suggests taking the satellite images and
processing them only at key times during the growth cycle, rather than on a
continuous basis for each geographic area.</p>
<p>Standard Class 4.2. Create or synthesize a measurement system. Some elements
or fields must be added to the existing system</p>
<p>Standard 4.2.1. If an incomplete Su-field system cannot be detected or
measured, a single or double Su-field system with a field as an output is
created. If the existing field is inadequate, change or enhance the field
without interfering with the original system. The new or enhanced field should
have an easily detectable parameter that correlates to the parameter we need to
know.</p>
<p>Systems for measuring the location of a farm implement in a field have been
developed based on lasers. These require a fixed reference location and some
equipment located to establish it. The yield data for each location in a field
can then be recorded onto a detailed map of the field, and thus provide a means
to determine where more fertilizers or other additives are required.</p>
<p>Standard Class 4.3. Enhancing the measurement system</p>
<p>4.3.1. Apply natural phenomena. Use scientific effects that are known to
occur in the system, and determine the state of the system by observing changes
in the effects. Inertial (gyroscopic) systems could be added to the harvesting
systems so that the effect of moving the equipment through the field would
record its position.</p>
<p>Standard Class 4.4</p>
<p>Standards in the class 4.4 provide guidelines for Measuring Fe-fields. We
have not observed or encountered Fe-field applications in the World Food Supply
cases we have studied, so we only mention these standards here for reference. It
is conceivable that these standards might find application in the detection
systems for soil micronutrients. The Standards in class 4.4 are discussed with
examples in Ref. 1.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Standard Class 4.5. Direction of Evolution of the Measuring Systems</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4.5.1. Transition to bi- and poly-systems. If a single measurement system
does not give sufficient accuracy, use two or more measuring systems, or make
multiple measurements.</p>
<p>This standard predicts what is now being done by a few advanced practioners
of “Precision Farming” such as in central Saskatchewan, Canada. A farmer
there advocates and practices taking a “soil probe” for the top 12 inches of
soil in a field for every 2 acre section. This data is accumulated into a “grid
map” with GPS location data and can be analyzed for insects, type of soil,
moisture, macro and micronutrients, organic matter, topography, and other
significant variables. . A further improvement would be to more precisely
measure the “yield”, which is now commonly collected only as bushels.
Measurements of the actual weight, moisture level, and protein content of the
grain could be taken by precise location. These measures are now routinely taken
only in the aggregate.</p>
<p>In addition, a new process, the measurement of electrical conductivity of the
soil, guides where to take soil probe readings, instead of simply using a grid.
Changes in electrical conductivity show where changes in soil conditions occur.
Correlation to yields data provides an additional source of information to the
farmer. (Ref 14)</p>
<p>Standard 4.5.2. recommends that instead of a direct measurement of a
phenomenon, we should measure the first and second derivatives in time or in
space. As in 4.5.1, this standard predicts data based analysis of the time and
spatial trends of factors affecting yields, and their response to remedial
efforts. This information can then be utilized in the planning of future
remedial actions.</p>
<p>The flow chart for applying the Standard Solutions recommends using class 3
to refine the measurement systems that have been developed through use of the
Class 4 Standards. In Class 3 we find a variety of system transition
suggestions, such as the creation of the bi-system, which could lead to the idea
of correlating the crop yields to more than just the application rate of
macro-fertilizers. As we have discussed, this is now being done for
micronutrients, and also for measurement of soil physical condition and local
topography, organic matter content, and even insect population levels. (Ref. 15)</p>
<p>We now consider use of Standard Class 5 to make solutions more ideal.</p>
<p>Standard Class 5.1. Introducing Substances, includes 5.1.1.2 which recommends
using a field instead of a substance. This has been done through use of the
fields making up the Global Positioning System, as discussed above. Standard
5.1.1.5 suggests concentrating the additive at a specific location. This is now
being done as agricultural implements are continuing to be developed to more
precisely apply fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides in specific relation to
the individual seed.</p>
<p>Standard 5.1.2 calls for dividing the elements into smaller units. The use of
GPS systems, improved application implements, and increased usage of computers
for data storage and control reflects the application of this standard.</p>
<p>Other standards in Class 5 offer further suggestions for refinement of the
solutions and concepts already considered. One separate example illustrates the
importance of effective measurement / detection to the current state of
refinement of today’s agricultural production practices.</p>
<p>The process of modifying the genetic structure of plants is actually done in
bacterium that has the ability to be assimilated by the target plant to generate
a genetic modification. The gene desired to be introduced into the plant is
inserted into the genetic material of the bacterium. This process is
inefficient, because of the requirement for specific spatial alignment of the
nucleic acid structures involved, and complexities of cellular mechanisms, and
may be successful in only one in 10 Million (or worse) individual organisms. The
burden of searching for these successful transformations would require hundreds
of researchers.</p>
<p>In state of the art practice, the gene with the desired effect is coupled
with a gene known to cause resistance to an antibiotic, before insertion into
the bacterium. This is a known and easily reproducible process. After the
insertion of the genetic material into the bacteria, the organisms are cultured
in plates with growth media containing the antibiotic. Only the individual
organisms in which the transformation has been successful survive, all others
are killed by the antibiotic. This makes detection of the desired organisms
self-evident.</p>
<p>The successfully modified organisms are then cultured and applied to the
target plant, which incorporates the modified genetic material from the
bacterium.</p>
<p>This is an excellent example of applying Standard 4.1.1, modification of the
system so there is no longer a need for detailed measurement. (Ref. 16)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Case C: Prediction Pathway - Illustrative Example: Food Distribution
Processes</b></p>
<p>The problem of hunger (the problem of meeting the nutritional needs of every
individual) will become more complex as the world population grows. Even those
who argue that there is enough food production capacity to match expected
population growth agree that we need to more effectively manage food production.
The effective utilization of food will mean making sure that the right foods are
grown/manufactured, and that they get to the people who need them, thus
eliminating waste. &quot;Right foods&quot; means that the food meets the
nutritional needs, is considered culturally and socially appropriate by the
individual(s) using them and can be stored and prepared within the context of
that individual's resources. (There is a wide variability in the level and types
of these resources (cooking fuel, refrigeration, storage capacity, water, etc.)</p>
<p>At a high level, the current system looks like Figure 11. Please note that
from a Systems Dynamics point of view, information could also be considered a
substance:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="11.gif" width="502" height="141"><br>
<b><br>
FIGURE 11</b></p>
<p>How should the system be modified as a result of the increasing requirement
for efficiency and effectiveness?</p>
<p>Following the Flowchart for Using the 76 Standard Solutions, one is led to
the “Forecasting” Pathway that begins with Class 2 Solutions, those which
will require minimum change to the system.</p>
<p>2.2.1 suggests looking at a poorly controlled field that might be replaced or
modified.</p>
<p>In our problem, the information field is often weak, perhaps including only
population and aggregate caloric needs of the people. Could it be enhanced to
include more information about individual needs? As the Human Genome Project
continues, we will be able to more easily glean specific information about these
nutritional requirements. Can we look for ways to effectively use that
information?</p>
<p>Other improvements in this field might include the following considerations:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>How many people have special dietary needs due to health conditions such
    as Diabetes or AIDS?</li>
  <li>What are the food storage conditions in an area?</li>
  <li>What are the modes of food storage and preparation that are available?</li>
  <li>What is the current level of food production in the community?</li>
  <li>Are there any new circumstances (weather conditions, disease) that are
    impacting the food needs or the food production of the community?</li>
</ul>
<p>A change in the Food Delivery System from a macro level to a micro level is
suggested by 2.2.2. This leads to the following ideas: Consider the delivery
model in terms of its components: growers, manufacturers, food, shipping
vessels, people, distribution stations. In doing this, we might begin to ask if
trucks could be better utilized to carry multiple items that more closely match
the needs, rather than large quantities of bulk items. Instead of large, single
bay trucks or containers, could smaller compartments be used or smaller
shipments? (Although Class 2 solutions are not meant to generate larger systems
change ideas, one might ask here: Can we better utilize other delivery modes:
air drops, pipeline, etc.)</p>
<p>Consider the food itself at a micro level: raw materials, in-process
materials and finished goods, macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients
can be further broken down to carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Instead of a
food being called simply &quot;rice&quot;, could it be coded to contain more
information that would include details about its nutritional value (This has
been done with Nutritional Labeling in many countries.)? i.e., the so-called “protein”
is actually a combination of several amino acids. Thus diets of combinations of
rice and beans or corn and beans offer enhanced nutrition. A more extreme
example of this concept is the so-called macro-biotic diet. By thinking of food
at the micro level, we might be able to solve storage problems. A well-known
example is milk, which has a short shelf-life, but when water is removed to
create powdered milk, the shelf-life is significantly extended.</p>
<p>Consider the concept of need at a micro level: critical (preventing death),
short-term sustainability (ongoing food supplies that prevent getting to the
critical level) and long-term sustainability (providing the self-sustaining mode
of food production/acquisition to communities).</p>
<p>Can we target food aid at a micro level? Instead of donating gross quantities
of food to &quot;Africa&quot;, can we move toward donating the &quot;right&quot;
foods to individual communities?</p>
<p>Take a micro look at &quot;aid&quot;. What are its forms? What are the
specific information needs for each form? Do aid givers need to know how
productive their efforts are? How can we get that information back to that level
the Food Delivery System? If we get that information back, does it encourage
more giving, in addition to improving the effectiveness of the system? Is the
correct aid to provide fish for consumption, or to teach how to fish? Or even to
teach how to produce fish? There are now organizations that focus their efforts
on providing locally sourced reproducing livestock, and training, rather than
actually distributing foodstuffs. (Ref 17)</p>
<p>The idea of changing S2 to something porous or capillary suggests making
physical improvements. Can existing warehouses be better utilized? What more can
be carried in the transportation vessels? Can the food itself be arranged to
reduce the need for bulky packaging? Can the food delivery system accommodate
other important non-food items (medication, clothing, etc.)?</p>
<p>As new infrastructure is built, do we need to think about smaller warehouses?
This is an idea that goes beyond the Class 2 level of change, but one could
certainly note it for future consideration.</p>
<p>Similarly, 2.2.1 asks how the system can be made more flexible or adaptable.
How can intermediate storage facilities and shipping systems be utilized to
accommodate a frequently varying mix of items, with their individual temperature
and handling requirements? Can we apply the information gained from an
organization like Webvan to the system of world food distribution?</p>
<p>As we begin to think about the more effective use of data, 2.2.1 leads to the
thought of capturing this data in a predetermined format that can be used by the
multiple actors in the food distribution system - growers, manufacturers and
distributors. Nutritional data for food should be standardized in a way that
matches nutritional needs of individuals.</p>
<p>Once food is delivered, 2.3.1 leads to consideration of the downtime of the
individual resources used for that delivery (the people, the trucks, etc.) How
can they be utilized?</p>
<p>What can be carried back in the truck? Perhaps the community ships its
produced goods (food that it does not need, or any other manufactured items).
Could the trucks provide transportation to people? Can the truck be left at the
delivery site and used for some purpose - then later picked up when the next
delivery is made? Perhaps the truck has refrigeration capacity that could
continue to be used as the food is distributed over a period of time.</p>
<p>Moving on in the “Forecasting” pathway to considerations of a change to
the super system or subsystem, Class 3 Solutions are considered. Immediately,
3.1.1 leads one to wonder how the Food Delivery System can be strengthened by
merging with other systems? Can water delivery somehow match up with this
system? Certainly, information about water needs is a part of the information
needed to determine the best form of the food. What else is physically delivered
to varying parts of the world? Are there new areas where these systems can work
together synergistically? Do systems of information exist that can combine with
the Information System regarding the needs of people?</p>
<p>What kind of control systems is needed when we link the information systems
to the delivery systems? One can imagine the &quot;food traffic report&quot;.
Where is there a jam? What are the alternatives? At what points can changes be
made to the &quot;plan&quot;? These are suggested by 3.1.2, which considers
linking systems.</p>
<p>Consideration of the timing of the interaction of the information from the
user and Food Distribution System is pointed to in 2.3.1, and the idea can be
expanded when looking at 3.1.2. The Food Distribution System needs to be
responding to current information about the needs of people. It also needs to be
coordinated within the large network of its members. How do these individual
users know when this information has been &quot;consumed' and acted on by
various members of the network? (Think of an Internet-based wedding gift list.
Once you have selected one of the desired items on the list, it is marked as
such so that there is no duplication of that purchase.)</p>
<p>These ideas might then lead to a more refined problem statement having to do
with creating an information system that weaves together many different
technologies. Could voice transmission, paper records and electronic data roll
up into one central Information System that can inform the Food Delivery System?
Of course, this is a problem that has been tackled in many industries.</p>
<p>Working this specific problem through Class 3 solutions makes sense because
Class 3 deals with trends of technology evolution.</p>
<p>The linkage of these various forms of data is looked at in 3.1.2. Scanning
paper data into a computer system, and, where phones are available, converting
voice to digital systems are two ideas that immediately come to mind. Once all
data is in digital form, it can easily be manipulated and then produce output in
a variety of forms.</p>
<p>When a solution is found, make it more ideal by applying Class 5 solutions.
If we choose the idea of moving from large, rigid storage facilities to more
flexible storage, a number of ideas emerge by reviewing Section 5. 5.1.1 suggest
using &quot;nothing&quot;. Is it possible that some of our food items can be
stored outside? Could we use existing space for storage? Could we store the food
in the ground? 5.1.3 suggests using a storage structure that can eliminate
itself after use. In some parts of the world foodstuffs are safely stored in the
open air, in a frozen state. The storage system does effectively eliminate
itself at the end of winter.</p>
<p><b>6. Conclusion</b></p>
<p>“Solve World Hunger” is frequently used as an example of an unsolvable
problem. But, the methods of the 76 Standard Solutions in TRIZ can generate
creative, practical, realistic ways of addressing many of the components of the
problem of world hunger. We invite the TRIZ community to join us to expand and
make use of the Food Supply Lifecycle Matrix that defines elements of the
problem, to develop solutions to those specific problems using any of the
techniques of TRIZ, and to propagate the solutions to the companies, charitable
agencies, governmental agencies, and people who can put them to use to truly END
world hunger.</p>
<p>We have not addressed any examples from the initial “Demand” phase of the
lifecycle model we presented above, even though this area clearly offers great
opportunity for TRIZ application. Many of us as children were urged to “clean
your plate”, and were perhaps trained to over consume. Our future population
growth, social customs and consumption patterns may well be considered as
processes to which we should apply the 76 Standard Solutions.</p>
<p>The Food Supply Lifecycle Matrix and discussions about this challenging
opportunity are accessible through a TRIZ-World Hunger E-Group. We invite you to
contact any of the authors via our addresses below to join that group. Your
comments, suggestions, and shared problems and solution concepts will be
accessible through the TRIZ_Journal.</p>
