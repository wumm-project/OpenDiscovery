<p><font color="#006600" face="Century"><font size="-1">I wrote this paper
during my work of Japanese translation of Yuri Salamatov's TRIZ textbook &lt;</font><font size="1">http://www.osaka-gu.ac.jp/php/nakagawa/TRIZ/eTRIZ/electures/eSalamatovTextbook001122/eSalamatovTextbook001122.html</font><font size="-1">&gt;</font></font><font size="-1" color="#006600" face="Century">
&quot;TRIZ: The Right Solution at the Right Time&quot;, being stimulated by one
of its exercise problems.&nbsp; Problem 43 of the textbook describes the
difficulty of escaping from and rescuing people from fire of modern high-rise
buildings, and shows a design of&nbsp; Vilchinsky's 'gravitational elevator' for
urgent evacuation seeking for your further improvement.&nbsp; While working on
the brushing up of our Japanese translation, I was thinking that we should have
some more basic and essencial improvement for preparing against fire.</font>
<blockquote>
  <font size="-1" color="#006600" face="Century">Note:&nbsp; For a breif
  introduction to TRIZ and USIT, see (D) of this paper.</font>
</blockquote>
<font size="-1" color="#006600" face="Century">Many years ago I saw an American
movie &quot;Towering Inferno&quot; (1974) on TV.&nbsp; It delt with a fire of a
skyscraper and gave a shock to the world.&nbsp; On fire, the elevators stopped
working, staircases got fire and smoke due to the chimney effect, and people
were confined in the top floor lobby while the burning fire was getting
closer.&nbsp; I thought, among many other people, that we should have some
secure ways to safely escape from fire of high-rise buildings.</font>
<p><font size="-1" color="#006600" face="Century">While doing the translation
work, I thought that we should, first of all, keep the staircases as the safe
evacuation routes and that we should avoid the staircases from becoming a
chimney in case of fire.&nbsp; Then I came up with the simple idea that for
preventing the chimney effect we should just have big windows on every floor of
the staircases.&nbsp; I wrote it down on a small piece of scratch pad at
hand.&nbsp; It was on August 1st, this year.</font>
<p><font size="-1" color="#006600" face="Century">The idea written on the pad
gradually grew in my mind, and I became confident that the idea of setting large
openings on every floor at the starcases is simple yet very effective solution
to this problem.&nbsp; So I started to write down my idea in the morning of
August 7&nbsp; at home during the summer vacation.&nbsp; Soon after starting, I
began to use the format of &quot;Description of an Invention&quot; which we
used&nbsp; at Fujitsu Labs for showing inventive ideas to patent specialists for
their help.&nbsp; Following the format, I wrote down my idea with a numbr of
small goes and backs; it took me about six hours for the work.&nbsp; The
&quot;Description of an Invention&quot; is posted here in Section (B).</font>
<p><font size="-1" color="#006600" face="Century">During this writing work, I
considered various points and wrote them down in the manuscript.&nbsp; If you
ask me &quot;Did you use TRIZ and/or USIT process?&quot;, I feel some difficulty
to answer.&nbsp; I did not use formal processes of TRIZ/USIT, but I certainly
used many principles and thinking ways of TRIZ and USIT together with many other
experiences and background knowledge in my mind.&nbsp; I just used all my
ability during thinking and writing, without explicitly following any single
methodologyexcept the format itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, the following two
points are clear:</font>
<p><font size="-1" color="#006600" face="Century">Fist, in defining the problem,
I chose &quot;To keep the staircases safe for evacuation preventing from
becoming like a chimney in case of fire&quot;.&nbsp; This problem definition has
determined the whole problem solving process for the present work.&nbsp; I feel
I used the USIT way of thinking for this problem definition process.</font>
<p><font size="-1" color="#006600" face="Century">Second, I solved the problem
with the final solution: &quot;In ordinary times, the staircases are convenient
and confortable, located inside the building, and in cases of fire, they are
wide opened to outside, serving as the safe evacuation routes and as the bases
for firedistinguishing and rescue activities.&quot;&nbsp; This solution clearly
reflects the TRIZ' Separation Principle in time.&nbsp; During solving, I had
clear recognition of a technical contradiction (between convenience/confortability
and fire-preparation) and a physical contradiction (i.e., staircases should be
located inside and simultaneously outside the building) of this problem.&nbsp;
And I was also well aware of my using the TRIZ way of solving the
contradictions.&nbsp; I became aware of these points right after starting the
description work.</font>
<p><font size="-1" color="#006600" face="Century">After finishing the
'Description of an Invention', I thought this solution could become a
patent.&nbsp; So I searched the patent database of Japanese Patent Office on the
internet.&nbsp; Using the keywords 'evacuation AND staircase', I got 56 hits of
Japanese patents.&nbsp; Quickly reviewing the patent abstracts, I found nothing
relevant.&nbsp; Furthermore, I have never seen buildings whose staircases are
designed in the sense of the present idea.</font>
<p><font size="-1" color="#006600" face="Century">It was certainly of some
interest for me to obtain a patent on this idea, if possible.&nbsp; But I
declined to do so, considering the tedious work of&nbsp; finding some
appropriate collaboration company for filing the patent and of fighting in
courts to realize the benefits of the patent.&nbsp; Moreover, if I should seek
for the possibility of patent, this idea would have to be kept secret for a
certain period, and would be much delayed and limited in being realized in
society.&nbsp; So having thought for a week, I have decided not to try to file a
patent on this idea but to publish it as widely as possible so as to be realized
in a huge number of buildings in Japan and in the world.&nbsp; Fortunately, I am
in a position to be able to publish this idea freely without requesting any
permition from others.</font>
<p><font size="-1" color="#006600" face="Century">For this purpose, I am posting
the present paper publicly in my Web site &quot;TRIZ Home Page in

<p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Century">1.&nbsp; Exercise Problem in
Salamatov's TRIZ Textbook</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">As described above in the Preface, the
present work happened to start during my work of translating Yuri Salamatov's
TRIZ textbook from English into Japanese.&nbsp; This textbook explains a wide
range of aspects of TRIZ in a systematic way, and the translation work gave me a
precious chance of studying the textbook very closely.&nbsp; Among many problems
in the textbook, Problem 43 (pp. 66-67) is read as follows:</font><br>
&nbsp;
<blockquote>
  <font color="#000000" face="Century">Problem 43.&nbsp; New buildings are
  getting taller, 20-, 30-, 50-, 100-storied buildings appear.&nbsp; But
  survival craft remains practically with no change.&nbsp; The longest
  telescopic ladder available today only reaches the 12th floor.&nbsp; At the
  same time one can only rescue people through windows, because staircases and
  elevators turn into gigantic chimneys.&nbsp; Fire can spread very quickly
  turning a skyscraper into a burning candle.&nbsp; You should not count on the
  rescue service with their ropes, ladders, automatic elevators and even the
  hi-tech 'flying saucers', or mini-helicopters manufactured now in Japan.&nbsp;
  There should be one simple and reliable method of urgent evacuation from a
  building on fire.</font>
  <p><font color="#000000" face="Century">A 'rescue hose' was invented.&nbsp; It
  was made of elastic cloth and armoured with glass fiber.&nbsp; When the hose
  is not used, its diameter is a bit smaller than the average thickness of
  man.&nbsp; One can regulate fall speed by expanding one's elbows and moving
  one's knees together.&nbsp; Unfortunately, not everyone can use this bright
  idea.&nbsp; The system cannot be recommended to elderly people and children
  even after long training.</font>
  <p><font color="#000000" face="Century">The system was improved by G.
  Vilchinsky (Soviet Patent no. 1 024 098).</font><center>
  <p><img src="gravelev.gif" nosave width="310" height="339"></center>
  <blockquote>
    <font color="#000000" face="Century">Gravitational elevator, invented by G.
    Vilchinsky.</font><br>
    <font color="#000000" face="Century">[When a person gets on,] Elastic
    chambers (1) shrink, driving excessive pressure through the pipe line (2)
    into the reservoir (3).&nbsp; The piston (4) moves, compressing the spring
    (5).&nbsp; When a person exits the receiving chamber (6), the spring brings
    the piston to its initial position, air enters the crushed chambers (1)
    expanding them.</font>
  </blockquote>
  <p><br>
  <font color="#000000" face="Century">We suggest that you improve it further:
  the process of technical system development is endless.&nbsp; What is bad
  about the system?&nbsp; Try to make it more effective, decrease it in size and
  mass, add new functions to it, for the fire may not happen at all the system
  will be out of use.</font><br>
  &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<font color="#000000" face="Century">The introduction part of the Problem is
written vividly to urge readers' attention.&nbsp; But the device for urgent
evacuation, especially the one illustrated in the above figure, does not seem to
work effectively, even reading the explanation many times.&nbsp; &quot;Something
is wrong in this idea&quot;, I have had such a vague impression for over a year
since I read it first.</font><br>
&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Century">2.&nbsp; Background Knowledge and
Experiences</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">My background knowledge about the fire
of high-rise buildings is at the level of common sense but still large.&nbsp;
You readers would have similar or even much more knowledge.&nbsp; Some of my
background knowledge reminding me with strong impression are described&nbsp;
below:</font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">(1)&nbsp; American movie &quot;Towering
Inferno&quot; (1973):&nbsp; I saw this movie on TV many years ago.&nbsp; A
skyscraper in US has got a fire.&nbsp; Sprinklers do not work well. The fire
extends through the ducts towards upstairs much more rapidly than
expected.&nbsp; People who try to go down with the elevator are locked in
between the stories and have to get out of it by breaking the top of the carrage.&nbsp;
Staircases get flame and smoke like in a chimney and can not be used for
escaping.&nbsp; A fire-man who goes up in the emergency staircases has
nearly&nbsp; been caught by the flame.&nbsp; Many people are forced by the fire
to go up to the roof top.&nbsp; Helicoptors are not accessible to the roof top
because of the heat and strong winds induced by the fire.&nbsp; The water
reservoir on the roof top has been broken by the explosives and it has
extinguished the fire finally.&nbsp; --&nbsp; This movie gave a big impact on
people around the world.&nbsp; It has vividly described possible situations when
a skyscraper gets fire.&nbsp; What sort of solutions can we find out to this
kind of disasters?</font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">(2)&nbsp; Emergency devices for going
down:&nbsp; My office at the university is located on the 4th floor of an
eight-story building.&nbsp; An emergency device, named Slow-Down, is equipped
inside the window at the rounge near the elevator hall.&nbsp; In case of
emergency, we are supposed to put its belt around our waist and go down by
hanging on a rope.&nbsp; I have read its instruction written on the box several
times, but have had no experience of using it.&nbsp; Except for the emergency
cases, no one should handle it, thus no one in the building has made an exercise
on it.&nbsp; In case of a real fire, and of having no other ways, we will have
to use it in a &quot;do-or-die&quot; situation. We recall that recently during
an on-air TV program for demonstrating the usage of this kind of device, a woman
TV caster accidentally dropped from fifth floor and seriously wounded, because
the end of the rope slipped from the fixed furniture.&nbsp; I know some other
emergency escape devices like a tube, in which we slide down.&nbsp; It must be
terrifying for us to use it from 10th story of a building.&nbsp; Is it still
useful to slide down from 20th story of a building?</font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">(3)&nbsp; Staircases in high-rise
buildings:&nbsp;&nbsp; In tall buildings, having several or more stories, it is
common to use elevators for going up and down in ordinary situations.&nbsp; In
such buildings, it is sometimes difficult for us to find the staircases for
going up/down to the adjacent floor.&nbsp; Staircases are built at a place
almost hidden, and the fire-door to them are closed with the sign of 'emergency
exit'.&nbsp; Using such staircases, I feel a strange atomosphere as if someone
regards me going through a confidencial place like a theft. In most cases, such
staircases do not have windows and look like in a warehouse.&nbsp;
Staircases&nbsp; in hotels are more or less the same.</font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">(4)&nbsp; In Japan, there was a
disastrous fire at the Hotel New Japan in 1978.&nbsp; Many hotel guests were
burned without finding their ways out.&nbsp; Newspapers reported that a man
escaped from the fire by traversing on the outside wall from the windows to
windows.&nbsp; Later, I was surprised to meet one of my old university
classmates who declared that he himself was the person.</font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">(5)&nbsp; Buildings with three, four
stories often install emergency staircases outside on the side walls.&nbsp; The
emergency exit doors can be opened only from inside.&nbsp; But the emergency
exits often become the weak point in preventing from thefts, because some people
living in the building may leave the doors unlocked for various reasons, e.g.
making shortcuts, coming back after the closing time, etc.</font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">In addition, concerning the chimney
effects, I have various background knowledge.&nbsp; During my childhood, I
burned woods for heating bath water; thus I learned the effects of chimney and
wind for burning.&nbsp; I have read and seen industrial problems for burning in
furnaces and for cooling electrical equipments by introducing natural air flow
using the chimney effect, etc.&nbsp; -- By the way, I now notice that we have
experienced a number of problems for introducing and intensifying the chimney
effect but seldom experienced the problem for reducing the chimney effect.</font><br>
&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Century">3.&nbsp; Getting the Idea on the
Problem</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">While reading the above mentioned
Salamatov's problem and examining the figure, I was thinking that this figure is
not clear in its mechanism and this device would not work well.&nbsp; This
thought was the initial point of the present work.</font>
<blockquote>
  <font color="#000000" face="Century">&nbsp;-&nbsp; Making the device as a
  vertical straight column, it would become a chimney just like the
  staircases.&nbsp; -- At that time I thought so.&nbsp; But if the device is
  attached on the outside wall of the building, it may be avoidable from
  becoming a chimney, I now think.</font>
  <p><font color="#000000" face="Century">-&nbsp; How many passenger carrages
  are installed in this device?&nbsp; There should be a carrage wherever people
  want to get on, while empty carrages should not block the passenger carrage to
  go down.</font>
  <p><font color="#000000" face="Century">-&nbsp; How should we do after one
  person gets off?&nbsp; We should lift up the carrage for rescuing the next
  person.&nbsp; --&nbsp; We may install many carrages in a loop-form way, I now
  think.</font>
  <p><font color="#000000" face="Century">-&nbsp; The idea of reserving and
  reusing the air pressure does not seem to work.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font color="#000000" face="Century">&quot;The idea in this figure seems too
much sophisticated to work.&nbsp; Even if it works, no body would use it in
practise.&nbsp; We should reconsider this problem in a more essential way, I
thought.</font>
<p><font face="Century"><font color="#000000">Elevators should not be used
because of their risks of being stopped and being locked in.&nbsp; Then, we
should better use the staircases, because we can act there for ourselves and by
our own decision.&nbsp; We should better make the staircases more useful in case
of fire emergency.&nbsp; But staircases could not be used due to the chimney
effect, ...&nbsp; </font><font color="#3333ff">Then, we should just prevent the
staircases from becoming a chimney!&quot;</font></font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">When I came up with the idea of
&quot;preventing the staircases from becoming a chimney&quot;, the solution to
it was trivial.&nbsp; If we make large openings in the staircase, the chimney
could be interrupted. Even though we have a sequence of staircases from the
ground to the top, we should just put large openings on every story of the
staircases. Then the staircases would not become a chimney, by breaking the air
flow and smoke at every story.&nbsp; This idea is based on a simple knowledge
which pupil in elementary schools or junior highschools learn in classes.</font>

Problems</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Century">2.1&nbsp; Application Areas of the
Invention</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The present
invention concerns with the design of high-rise buildings with several or more
stories, especially with the design and structure of such buildings taking prior
consideration of emergency escaping means in case of fire and earthquake, and
particularly with the design of staircase rooms of such buildings.</font>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Century">2.2&nbsp; Conventional Means</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As ordinary
means to go upstairs or downstairs in high-rise buildings, (a) elevators, (b)
escalators, and (c) staircases are widely used.&nbsp; As emergency means to go
upstairs or downstairs for escaping in case of fire and earthquake, however, the
elevators are usually prohibited to use and the escalators are not convenient
even in operational cases, thus the staircases should make a major role.</font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staircases for
such emergency escaping are usually installed on the outside walls of buildings,
because the staircases built inside the buildings would often become like
chimneys by themselves.&nbsp; However, the staircases on the outside walls bring
different problems of possible invasions and thefts in ordinary days.&nbsp; Thus
staircase design should be considered to overcome these new problems as well.</font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From these
points of view as emergency escaping route, the structure of staircases of
high-rise buildings may be classified in the following categories:</font>
<blockquote>
  <font color="#000000" face="Century"><b>(A)&nbsp; &quot;Internal
  Staircases&quot;</b>:&nbsp; staircases built inside the buildings</font>
  <blockquote>

    Staircases&quot;:</font><br>

    Staircases&quot;:</font><br>
    <font color="#000000" face="Century">Staircases which are separated from the
    rooms of the floor in the sense of fire protection and are formed as
    separated rooms by themselves.</font></p>

  <font color="#000000" face="Century"><b>(B) &quot;External Staircases&quot;</b>:&nbsp;
  staircases built or attached outside the buildings</font>
  <blockquote>

    Staircases&quot;:</font><br>
    <font color="#000000" face="Century">External staircases which should be
    used only in case of emergency and are prohibited to use in ordinary days by
    locking the door between the staircase and the floor room.&nbsp; The
    emergency-exit doors can be unlocked easily only from inside.&nbsp; The
    staircases are regarded as being outside the buildings in the sense of theft
    and invasion protection.</font>

<font color="#000000" face="Century">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the
ordinary means mentioned above, there can be various means for rescuing people
who are left at higher stories of a burning building.&nbsp; They include
emergency descending devices, fire engines with long telescopic ladders,
helicopters, etc.&nbsp; These emergency means, however, are to be used for
rescuing people who have failed to escape safely at the earlier stages of
fire.&nbsp; The present invention intends to make larger chances of escaping
from fire safely at the earlier stages.</font>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Century">2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; Problems of the
Conventional Means</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High-rise
buildings have been built higher and larger and in ever increasing
numbers.&nbsp; Once such a building gets fire, the fire spreads not only
horizontally at the floor but also vertically to the neighboring floors.&nbsp;
The fire spreads upstairs through ducts for air-conditioning and pipes and
cables, and through vertical spaces for elevators, escalators, and staircases
due to the chimney effects.&nbsp; The speed of upward extension of the fire is
often surprisingly fast, and it becomes difficult to rescue people who are left
at the floors higher than the burning floor.</font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In case of fire
or earthquake, it is the general policy of today to prohibit the usage of
elevators for emergency escaping.&nbsp; This is because the elevator may
abruptly stop its operation due to some damage in the driving or controlling
system and may confine people locked inside it, and because people in the
elevator have a high risk of being exposed to heat, smoke, and toxic gases
coming in due to the chimney effect of the elevator shaft.</font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Escalators may
be operational at the initial stages of fire, but probably not when the damage
of the fire spreads.&nbsp; Staying escalators can be used just like staircases,
but are slippery and not so convenient.</font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it has
much significance in case of fire whether the staircases are available as safe
escaping routes or not.&nbsp; If they are available and safe, people can make
their own ways out for themselves judging the emergency situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So let us examine the problems in staircases of each of the above mentioned
categories.</font>
<p><b><font color="#000000" face="Century">(A1)&nbsp; &quot;Non-separated
Internal Staircases&quot;:</font></b>
<blockquote>
  <font color="#000000" face="Century">At the floor where the fire starts
  burning, flame, smoke, and toxic gases can easily enter into the open
  staircase.&nbsp; Consequently the fire can quickly extend towards
  upstairs.&nbsp; Thus, this design of staircases is usually avoided in
  high-rise buildings.&nbsp; Apparently-open-style escalators and staircases at
  shopping floors of high-rise buildings usually have fire-doors or shutters
  installed to separate them from the floor rooms in case of fire.</font>
</blockquote>
<font color="#000000" face="Century"><b>(A2)&nbsp; &quot;Separated Internal
Staircases&quot;</b>:</font>
<blockquote>
  <font color="#000000" face="Century">In preparation against fire, this type of
  staircase are separated with firewalls from the rooms of the floor and are
  installed with fire-doors at the entrances to the inside passages.&nbsp; Being
  separated from the floor rooms, the staircases are built as separated rooms by
  themselves and forming a vertically-arranged sequence.&nbsp; This is the
  typical structure of staircases in today's high-rise buildings.&nbsp; However,
  if the fire-door is not closed tightly at the burning floor due to some
  failure, defect, or damage, then enter flame, smoke, and toxic gases into the
  staircases and go upwards all through.</font>
  <p><font color="#000000" face="Century">In today's high-rise buildings, this
  type of staircases are often built in a somewhat hidden space near the
  elevator hall, and are built with solid walls often without windows.&nbsp;
  This closed structure may come from necessity of air-conditioning in ordinary
  days.&nbsp; However, the closed and vertical hollow structure of this type of
  separated staircases causes the chimney effects in case of fire.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font color="#000000" face="Century"><b>(B1) &quot;Emergency-Only External
Staircases&quot;</b>:</font>
<blockquote>
  <font color="#000000" face="Century">This type of staircases are to be used
  only in cases of emergency.&nbsp; Thus the staircases are built with simple
  and humble structure, and are often maintained poorly.&nbsp; The management of
  locks of these emergency exit doors is often the problem concerning to the
  invasion and theft protection.&nbsp; The locks must allow to be opened easily
  and freely from inside at any time expecting the emergency cases, but must not
  be opened without keys from outside.&nbsp; If someone leaves an emergency door
  open for some reason, the problem of invasion and theft arises.</font>
  <p><font color="#000000" face="Century">This type of staircases are usually
  built on the outside wall without cover; so they do not involve the chimney
  effects, and are not suffered from being filled with heat, smoke, and toxic
  gases.&nbsp; This is a big advantage as an emergency-escaping route.&nbsp;
  From the viewpoints of style and invasion protection, however, this type of
  staircases are rarely adopted in modern high-rise buildings.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<b><font color="#000000" face="Century">(B2) &quot;Free-Access External
Staircases&quot;:</font></b>
<blockquote>
  <font color="#000000" face="Century">The advantage of this type of staircases
  is similar to that of (B1); since its structure is not closed, it does not
  involve the chimney effects, and is not suffering much from flame, smoke, and
  toxic gases in case of fire.</font>
  <p><font color="#000000" face="Century">Since this type of staircases are used
  every day and regularly and are freely accessible from outside, the means of
  regulating the entrance into the floor rooms must be provided.&nbsp; If the
  floors or the individual rooms are used or operated more or less independently
  by some limited number of people, they may be managed to lock
  separately.&nbsp; But such a locked-door system might be inconvenient if rooms
  at multiple floors are used by a large number of people such as those
  belonging to a business unit.&nbsp; Since the areas of staircases are outside
  the buildings, they are not air-conditioned and sometimes exposed to wind and
  rain.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  &nbsp;
</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summarizing these analyses, we find the main problem is
how to make compatible the two types of requests: they are the requests for
convenience, comfort, and safety from invasion and theft in everyday ordinary
situations on one side and the requests for availability, safety, and
effectiveness in emergency cases of by fire.&nbsp; Generally speaking, the
internal staircases of the (A1) and (A2) types are adapted primarily for the
ordinary situations but poorly for the emergency situations.&nbsp; The external
staircases (B1), on the other hand, is to be used only in emergency cases while
leaving useless in ordinary everyday situations; thus it is regarded as an
additive but not the main facility of the high-rise buildings.&nbsp; The (B2)
type external staircases have much advantages as the safety means against fire,
but seem to have limited applicability because they are uncomfortable and
inconvenient in ordinary situations.
<p><b><font color="#ff0000">2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; Tasks to Be Solved</font></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staircases of high-rise buildings have to be
designed and built so as to be not only convenient, comfortable, and safely
guarded for everyday ordinary use but also safe and secure as emergency escaping
routes in cases of fire and earthquake.&nbsp; In particular, they must be
designed not to cause the chimney effects in case of fire and not to get
suffered from being filled with flame, smoke, and toxic gases of fire.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also desirable to have subsidiary functions
that at the staircases people can stay safely on a temporary basis even during
the fire, look around and judge the current situations of the building and fire,
and moreover that the staircases serve the firemen and rescue team as their
bases for carrying out their full activities.<br>
&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#ff0000">3.&nbsp; Means to Solve the Problems</font></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the analysis of the problems as described above, we
have obtained the following solution for the staircase design:
<p>(1)&nbsp; To fulfill the convenience in ordinary time, the staircase should
basically be a kind of 'Internal Staircase'.
<blockquote>
  The staircase should be for every-day use, not exposed to wind and rain,
  comfortably air-conditioned, and safely guarded.
</blockquote>
(2)&nbsp; The staircase should be of a 'Separated' type of 'Internal Staircase',
in order to prevent the extension of fire and to ensure it as an emergency
escaping route.
<blockquote>
  The staircase must be separated from the rooms of the floor with firewalls and
  fire doors.<br>
  Even if the rooms of the floor are burning, the fire should be kept from
  entering into the staircase.<br>
  The fire door should block the flame, smoke, and toxic gases, as surely as
  possible.<br>
  The staircase must be built with non-inflammable materials, which should not
  produce toxic gases in fire.<br>
  It is suggested to set a fireproof window in the fire door at a low position
  near the floor.<br>
  It may be recognizable as the emergency exit in the darkened room.<br>
  It will guide people towards the lower position.<br>
  Firemen and rescue team can look into the room without opening the fire door.<br>
  The window at such a low position will not be attacked with fire so much.
</blockquote>
(3)&nbsp; In case of fire and earthquake, the windows of the staircase are
opened widely.
<blockquote>
  This means that the Internal Staircase changes its structure into that of the
  External Staircase only in case of fire.<br>
  For this purpose the staircase must be located towards the outside of the
  building.<br>
  Opening the windows performs the role of eliminating the chimney
  effects.&nbsp; The Internal Staircase which was a hollow cylinder (i.e. like a
  chimney) from the bottom to the top inside the high-rise building now has the
  openings at every floor and effectively loose the structure of the
  chimney.&nbsp; With the elimination of the chimney effects, the staircase now
  plays less role of letting the fire extend towards upstairs.<br>
  The smoke and toxic gases getting into the staircase may go out through the
  openings, without densely filling in the staircase on the burning and the
  neighboring floors.<br>
  At the staircase people can breathe the fresh outdoor air.&nbsp; Thus people
  may be allowed to stay there safely for the time being even during the fire.
</blockquote>
&nbsp;(4)&nbsp; The open windows and the halls of the staircase may be used as
the entrance and action bases for fire-distinguishing and rescuing activities
during the emergency.
<blockquote>
  The people escaping from fire and needing rescue can call help from there to
  the rescue team outside the building.<br>
  Devices for emergency exit may be equipped there.<br>
  The firemen and rescue team can get into the building through the open windows
  at the staircase (maybe with the help of a ladder or a helicopter).<br>
  It is suggested to make it possible for the escaping people to look around the
  outside walls of the building from the staircase.<br>
  This helps people understand the current situation better and escape from fire
  more safely.<br>
  To look around the outside walls, the staircase itself may be stuck out from
  the wall; but as an alternative, some concave mirrors may be set outside the
  staircase to see the walls (only in case of fire).
</blockquote>
(5)&nbsp; The windows of the staircase should be able to be opened in case of
fire remotely at the control center of the building.
<blockquote>
  The windows of the staircase may be opened by hand on site.&nbsp; But this
  hand operation may not be effective in case of emergency.&nbsp; So the windows
  should better be opened remotely at the control center.<br>
  The windows may be opened either on site or at the control center; they may be
  closed on site.<br>
  If any window of the staircase is opened by hand in ordinary situation, an
  alarm should be shown at the control center of the building.<br>
  The openings should better be made of transparent glasses, so that the people
  who use the building easily recognize them as the emergency openings.<br>
  The glasses of the windows should be reinforced so that once they break they
  are broken into small round pieces without the danger of injuring people.
</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, the present invention proposes the solution
that the ordinary &quot;Separated Internal Staircases&quot;, which have been
used most widely for high-rise buildings, should be turned into the
&quot;Free-Access External Staircases&quot; by opening the windows
simultaneously in case of fire.&nbsp; This opening of the windows results in
elimination of the chimney effects of the staircases, ensuring of the staircases
as safe escaping routes, and serving the staircases as the basements for the
escaping, firedistinguishing, and rescueing activities during the emergency
cases of fire.<br>

</blockquote>
<font color="#000000" face="Century">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the result of
the reasoning illustrated above, the exercise problem proceeds towards an
improvement of the means of emergency escaping.&nbsp; But the future of such a
device seems not bright enough.</font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we should go
back to the starting point of this problem and reconsider the solution for
escaping and rescuing people from fire.&nbsp;&nbsp; We think it most important
for us to escape or be rescued from fire in its early stage.&nbsp; This urges us
to find some effective solution on the basis of 'escaping with ordinary means';
it must be practical and widely applicable.&nbsp; Examining the reasons why such
means were rejected above, we find it &quot;because the elevators and staircases
turn into chimneys in case of fire&quot;.&nbsp; We should think over this
reasoning again.&nbsp; &quot;Do they necessarily become like a
chimney?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Is there any means of avoiding them from becoming a
chimney?&quot;&nbsp; This way of thinking was the key to the problem definition
in the present work.</font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As described
above, it is most important to think over the whole problem (i.e., 'the means of
escaping and rescuing people from fire' in the present case) and to find the
overall structure of the problem (i.e., 'the problem system') including various
conventional approaches.&nbsp; The specific problem currently requested (i.e.,
&quot;the improvement of Vilchinsky's emergency escape device&quot; in the
present case) should be examined again in the perspective of the whole problem
system.</font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This way of
thinking corresponds well with the USIT method in its problem definition
stage.&nbsp; USIT recommends to think the problem as a system.&nbsp; Sickafus
advises to select such a problem that the solution to it can bring significant
profit and to focus on the biggest and most essential issue in the
problem.&nbsp; In the problem definition stage of USIT, these points are
considered through the discussions in the problem solving team (and the guidance
by the leader).&nbsp; As a result of such discussions, USIT often guides the
team to much improve the initial problem definition by the person who brought
the problem and to come closer to the essence of the problem.</font>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, in
its initial stage of problem definition, USIT guides the team to consider and
discuss: &quot;What is the problem?&nbsp; What are the plausible root
causes?&nbsp; What is the (physical) mechanism of the problem?&quot;&nbsp; In
the present case study, USIT has guided me to consider &quot;Why escaping and
rescuing people from fire is so difficult?&quot;&nbsp; So it has made clear to
me &quot;Escaping from fire is difficult because elevators and staircases may
become unavailable in case of fire.&quot;&nbsp; Then I asked to myself &quot;Why
do they become unavailable?&quot; and get the answer &quot;Because they turn
into a chimney&quot;.&nbsp; Further I asked to myself &quot;Then, why do they
turn into a chimney?&nbsp; What is the physical mechanismof it?&quot;, and I
came to understand the problem of the staircase in the shape of a chimney, i.e.
a tall hollow cylinder without openings.&nbsp; As a result of these series of
questions, I have obtained the problem definition of the present case quite
naturally and have come up with the initial idea very easily.</font><br>

</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present case, I started to draft the document
directly on a PC with putting nearby the small piece of paper of the initial
idea scratched a week ago.&nbsp; I wrote the document&nbsp; in the normal order
of the above format.&nbsp; The actual process of drafting, however, went on back
and forth many times.&nbsp; When I wrote several sentences or one or two
paragraphs, I often noticed that the latter portion of the newly written part
should be placed not in the current section but in the next section of the
format.&nbsp; Thus I moved the latter portion to the next section and wrote some
more extension in the current section.&nbsp; I had to repeat this kind of
corrective work in the drafting.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most important work in drafting was to write
down the conventional means in a systematic way.&nbsp; I tried to write down my
knowledge and experiences, i.e. those similar to the ones everybody has, in a
systematic and logical way as much as possible.&nbsp; Eventually I classified
the structure of staircases into two categories of the escaping routes and then
into four categories in total.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are:
<blockquote>
  (A)&nbsp; Staircases inside the building&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A1)&nbsp; Not
  separated from the rooms of the floor<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  (A2)&nbsp; Separated from the rooms of the floor<br>
  (B)&nbsp; Staircases on the outside walls of the building&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  (B1)&nbsp; To be used only in emergency cases<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  (B2)&nbsp; To be used regularly all the time
</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This kind of classification of the staicases may seem
trivial, but very important.&nbsp; Classification is the process of defining
concepts.&nbsp; The classification should be able to sort various staircases of
different shapes and structures smoothly and properly.&nbsp; I tried to recall
the images of a large number of high-rise office buildings, department stores,
hotels, university buildings, apartment buildings, shopping center buildings,
etc. in Kasumigaseki, Shinjuku, and many other areas and tried to categorize the
features of&nbsp; their staircases.&nbsp;&nbsp; The system of classification
must be able to accept any conventional staircase in one of the
categories.&nbsp; Furthermore, the classification system should be able to state
that the staircase design newly proposed in the present invention demands a new
category in the classification framework.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the sections of conventional means and their
problems, I first describe various convnetional means for escaping and rescuing
people from fire in its overviews and then put stress on the necessity of
effectively using the staircases.&nbsp; This corresponds to the problem
situation and its focus; the thought for the problem definition must be
explained here logically.&nbsp; By stating the problem situation thoroughly, the
significance of the problem and the possible merit obtainable as the result of a
good solution will become more convincing.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problems of the conventional means are further
analyzed for each of the four categories of staircases.&nbsp; Problems of
staircases as the escaping routes in case of fire are pointed out as
follows:&nbsp; Category (A1) is&nbsp; defective becasue the fire can spread
easily.&nbsp; The separated internal staircases of Category (A2) aim to prevent
the fire from extending and to serve as escaping route, but in fact have the
drawbacks of becoming useless once the fire or smoke comes in due to the chimney
effects.&nbsp; From the view point of escaping route in case of fire, the
staircases (B1) and (B2) built on the outside walls of&nbsp; the buildings are
perfect.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, should we just adopt such external
staircases?&nbsp; No, unfortunately.&nbsp; Staircases built on the outside walls
of the building have their own problems concerning the safety in ordinary
days.&nbsp; The emergency-only staircases (B1) have the risks of being left open
either intently or unintently.&nbsp; The free-access external staircases (B2)
are often used at apartment buildings, where every flat is managed and locked
independently by the residents.&nbsp; Such scheme of safety management may not
always be convenient for big buildings of varaious usage.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This process of analyzing and describing the
problems of conventional means is close to the analysis process in TRIZ.&nbsp;
In practice, I made this analysis work with full usage of a number of TRIZ
methods in my mind.&nbsp; Thus, the actual way of my thinking while I drafted
the sections of 'Problems of the conventional means' and 'Tasks to be solved' is
explained in the next section with explicit reference to TRIZ concepts.<br>
&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#ff0000">3.&nbsp; Deriving Contradictions by the Use of TRIZ</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The analysis described in the
previous section has clearly shown the following points:&nbsp; For the purpose
of making the escaping routes in case of fire, the staircases should be built
not inside the building (i.e. Category (A2)) but outside the building on the
outer wall (i.e. Categories (B1) and (B2)).&nbsp; However, from the viewpoints
of the safety in ordinary days and the convenience and confortability for
everyday use, staircases inside the buildings are much superior to those
outside; thus the staircases outside the buildings may be adopted only for
buildings of limited types of usage.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This statement corresponds
exactly to the definition of a 'Technical Contradiction' in the TRIZ
theory.&nbsp; We now consider a building as a system and are dealing with a
staircase as its subsystem.&nbsp; In the staircase system, if we want to improve
the system's function as an escaping route (by locating the staircase on the
outside wall), the system's functions of convenience, confortability, and safety
become intolerably worse.&nbsp; Namely, we are faced with a type of
contradiction where &quot;If we improve one aspect of the system, some other
aspect gets intolerably worse.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; This type of contradiction is
called a 'Technical Contradiction' in TRIZ.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being faced with such a
contradiction, practical engineers often try trade-offs.&nbsp; Since no good
compromise has been found in this case, however, most buildings of several
stories adopt emergency-only external staircases while high-rise buildings adopt
separated internal staircases without preparing for the emergency
escaping.&nbsp; Hence breaking this contradiction is the task to be solved in
this case study.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you consider the above
technical contradiction more carefully, you may naturally notice another
view.&nbsp; It is the view distinguishing the time of emergency from much longer
ordinary days.&nbsp; We want staircases to be convenient, sheltering from wind
and rain, air-conditioned, and safely-guarded for the use of ordinary
days.&nbsp; Emergency case of fire is the special period of time, when we want
to ensure the staircase to be the route for escaping safely from fire.&nbsp;
During this special time of fire nobody cares sheltering from rain and wind and
safety from theft, etc.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consideration of this kind of
characteristics is always performed in the USIT method at the stage of 'Analysis
of space and time characteristics'.&nbsp; There continues a long period of
ordinary time of everyday life, and suddenly the emergency of fire may
arise.&nbsp; What and how to do during the ordinary days in preparation against
unforeseeable emergency is the task of disaster preparation.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After thinking in this manner,
the requirements for the design of staircase can be described as follows:&nbsp;
&quot;In order to be convenient, sheltering from wind and rain, air-conditioned,
and safely-guarded against thefts in ordinary days, the staircase should be
built inside the building, whereas the staircase should be built outside the
building so as to keep it as the safe escaping route in case of fire.&quot;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above statement
corresponds exactly to that of a 'Physical Contradiction' in TRIZ.&nbsp; The
situation where &quot;An aspect of a technical system is requested toward
positive and toward negative at the same time&quot; is called a 'Physical
Contradiction' in TRIZ.&nbsp; In the present study, the staircase system is
requested to be built inside the building to fulfill various requirements in
ordinary days, whereas it is requested to be built outside the building for the
requirements in case of fire.&nbsp; Namely, a staircase is under the
contradictory requests that it should be built inside the building and outside
the building at the same time.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TRIZ recommends us to solve
problems by reformulating the problem into the Technical Contradictions and then
further into the Physical Contradictions.&nbsp; Especially, TRIZ provides very
clear and powerful principles for solving the Physical Contradictions.&nbsp;
They are the 'Separation Principles'.&nbsp; When we are faced with the
contradiction where one aspect of the system is requested to be made in the
positive and negative directions at the sametime, TRIZ asks us &quot;Do the two
opposite requests need to be fulfilled <i>really</i> simultaneously?&quot;&nbsp;
It urges to to think more closely:&nbsp; &quot;Can't you separate the two
requests with respect to space? with respect to time? or with respect to some
other condition?&quot;&nbsp; In the present case, it is quite trivial that the
two opposite requests (i.e. to be built inside/outside the building) refer to
separated time periods, i.e. ordinary days and emergency time in case of fire.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guideline in TRIZ to solve
a Physical Contradiction with the separation principle is clear as
follows:&nbsp; &quot;In case the two requests are separated by the time, then
during the time period when the request is positive we should fulfil the
positive request, wheras during the time period when the request is negative we
should just fulfil the negative request.&quot;&nbsp; In the present case this
means: &quot;During the ordinary days the staircase should be built inside the
building so as to be convenient, protecting from rain and wind, and
air-conditioned, whereas during the emergency time of fire the staircase shold
be built outside the building so as to keep it as the escaping
route.&quot;&nbsp; We must think over the real meaning of this message and how
we can realize it, as the next step.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this step of TRIZ method,
to realize the stated requirement, some physical principle (or chemical,
biological, social principle) need to be introduced, says Salamatov.&nbsp; In
our case, we have to introduce some physical principle to realize the puzzling
requirement, i.e. &quot;To build the staircase inside the building during
ordinary days and outside the building in case of fire&quot;.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present case, such a
principle (or a clew to solve the&nbsp; puzzle) is easily found among common
sense knowledge of ordinary people:&nbsp; &quot;To equip big windows (i.e.
openings) at every floor of the staircase and open them widely in case of fire,
so as to achieve the effect similar to that of rebuilding the staircase outside
the building.&quot;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This clew has come from the
common sense knowledge, but in fact is based on a physical principle of the
chimney effects.&nbsp; The staircases inside the buildings have the demerits of
quick extension of fire and smoke because of the chimney effects and of becoming
unavailable as the escaping routes.&nbsp; The external staircases, on the other
hand, have been designed for the intention of avoiding the chimney effects.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chimney effects can be
described in a more scientific way as follows:&nbsp; If there is a hollow
cylinder stretched long in the vertical direction and if the bottom (or middle)
part contain hotter air, then a strong airflow is induced in the cylinder from
the bottom to the top.&nbsp; If an opening is made in the middle of the
cylinder, the &quot;chimney&quot; is effectively cut into two halves, making the
airflow localised and weak as a whole.&nbsp; Since we know well about this
physical effect, the naive idea of making windows at the every floor of the
staircase is understood to have some scientific basis and is expected to work.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As explained above, TRIZ
supposes to refer, after formulating the (physical) contradiction, to some
scientific and technical principles for finding a solution to the
contradiction.&nbsp; However, the consideration with scientific and technical
principles should be made not only in such a late stage of problem solving
process.&nbsp; In fact, in the USIT method, i.e. a simplified TRIZ method, the
physical mechanism of the problem is examined and the plausible root causes are
searched at the early stage of the problem definition.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in the USIT approach, at
the initial stage of considering the present problem, the essence of the problem
is found to be &quot;Staircases built inside the buildings behave like a chimney
in case of fire and become unavailable as escaping routes&quot;, and then its
physical mechanism is considered.&nbsp; The (scientific/engineering)
consideration about the chimney effects lead us to understand that the long
hollow structure in the vertical direction causes the effects.&nbsp; &quot;If
it's the case, we should just make windows as openings and divide the hollow
cylinder into smaller ones.&quot; -- this idea will come out at an easy step.</font><br>
&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#ff0000">4.&nbsp; Constructing Solutions and Implementing
with Technology</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now solved the
contradictions and obtained a basic idea clearly.&nbsp; Hence at the next step,
we should extend the core idea and make various technical considerations to
construct a united and practically feasible solution.&nbsp; I carried out this
stage of work by drafting the section &quot;Means to solve the problems&quot; of
the 'Description of an Invention'.&nbsp; I wrote the section with a number of
minor revisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The orders of the ideas coming out were not the
same as their orders written in the final document, of course.&nbsp; However,
the main process of thinking was nearly the same in order as the final document.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main ideas of the solution
are as follows, as extracted from the document:</font>
<blockquote>
  (1)&nbsp; To fulfill the convenience in ordinary time, the staircase should
  basically be a kind of 'Internal Staircase'.<br>
  (2)&nbsp; The staircase should be of a 'Separated' type of 'Internal
  Staircase', in order to prevent the extension of fire and to keep it as an
  escaping route.<br>
  (3)&nbsp; In case of fire and earthquake, the windows of the staircase are
  opened widely.<br>
  (4)&nbsp; The open windows of the staircase may be used as the entrance for
  fire-distinguishing and rescuing activities during the emergency.<br>
  (5)&nbsp; The windows of the staircase should be able to be opened in case of
  fire remotely at the control center of the building.
</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These ideas are written in a top-down style from the
main principle of design to some details.&nbsp; First the new design of the
staircase is specified as an 'Internal Staircase', and then of the 'Separated'
type, similar to the (A2) type of the conventional design.&nbsp; At item (3), it
is further specified that the windows of the staircase should be opened widely
in case of fire.&nbsp; This specification is the essence of the solution in the
present invention.&nbsp; The items of (1) and (2) describe the basic design of
the staircase in the ordinary days, and form a unified solution together with
the item (3).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The specification (4) makes the openings of the
staircase serve as the entrance and action basis for the fire-distinguishing and
rescuing activities, and claims the function as an additional merit.&nbsp; TRIZ
recommends that, after the introduced of a new solution into a part of the
system, one should examine other parts of the system to make full use of the
merit of the new solution and further improve the supersystem.&nbsp; In case of
fire, the newly-designed staircases are available not only to go down for
escaping but also to stay there safely for some time even while the building is
burning.&nbsp; The space of safe staircase should be used actively for fire
distinguishing and rescuing people.&nbsp; The widely opened windows make it
easier for the firemen and rescuing teams to perform their activities with
keeping communication with the staff outside the building; it is a merit that
the controlling staff of the fire-fighting troop can observe their teams'
activities and guide them.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The item (5) specifies how to control this facility
of windows.&nbsp; In the design of technical systems, it is essential to
describe how to control them.&nbsp; Here I wrote about the control system after
imaging modern high-rise buildings.&nbsp; It also specifies the control scheme
so that the people there can take their best ways after their judgement in the
emergency.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process of drafting the present solution, the
'Analysis of space and time characteristics' method in USIT was very useful and
illustrative for me.&nbsp; USIT recommends to analyse the characteristics of the
system in accordance with the 'time axis' specifically taken for the
system.&nbsp; Thus, various possible situations in case of fire are considered
along the time axis:&nbsp; Ordinary days without fire; the first stage of a
small fire (and getting out of the floor/building); the second stage of a fire
beginning to burn in a floor (and emergency evacuation of the floor/building);
next stage of fire burning in multiple stories (and emergency escaping from the
building and rescuing people); more serious stage of fire when the smoke and
fire enter into the staircase (and emergency escaping and rescuing people); and
so on.&nbsp; Consideration about these stages of fire step by step was helpful
to think of the problems and necessary solutions in different stages.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present study, the solutions described above were
obtained through knowledge in the level of common sense.&nbsp; If one deals with
different problems, one may certainly need much more knowledge in technical
specialities.&nbsp; Even so, I feel there may be rather large areas where the
essence of solutions can be found by non-specialists.
<p><b><font color="#ff0000">5.&nbsp; Concerning the Uncompleted Parts in the
'Description of an Invention'</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three main parts
which I have not completed in the above 'Description of an Invention'.&nbsp; The
first part is '</font>Examples of Application'.&nbsp; As a document for applying
a patent in this case, we should just show basic drawings of design; it is not
requested to actually build a high-rise building with the staircase of such a
design.&nbsp; I suppose most readers can imagine a staircase of the present idea
without showing the drawings.&nbsp; To implement the idea and further improve
the design of the solution, it is of course desirable and necessary to get help
of specialists in architecture and in fire fighting and to examine in practice.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second uncompleted part is the description of
'Effects'.&nbsp; The effects and performance of the new design must be tested by
model experiments and confirmed in practice.&nbsp; It is also desirable to
derive a designing guideline for achieving the effects as expected.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last part uncompleted in the document is the
statement of claims as patents.&nbsp; To fill this part, one should survey
conventional techniques and previous patents thoroughly and write down what is
claimed as new original ideas in the present request of a patent.&nbsp; It is
usually advised to write in general terms, so as not to restrict the claims
unnecessarily, and to make the claims cover as widely as possible.&nbsp; Since
it is difficult to write this part well, it is usually recommended to write down
the drafts and ask patent specialists to brush them up.
<p><b><font color="#ff0000">6.&nbsp; What To Be Done in Future To Establish the
Solution as New Techniques</font></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As written in the preface of this page, I have
just formed and documented the present idea, and decided not to try to file a
patent but to publicize it as widely as possible.&nbsp; It is desirable and
necessary to do some model experiments for checking the performance, to design
and implement in real high-rise buildings, and to make design guidelines if good
performance is achieved; all these work will need commitments by specialists in
the fields of architecture, fire fighting, etc.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should appreciate it very much if readers of this
article would examine the present idea and improve it further into good
solutions for safe escaping from fire.

A brief Introduction to TRIZ and USIT</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Aug.
24, 2000) </font><font size="-1" color="#006600">[English translation by
Nakagawa, Dec. 22, 2000 (posted on Feb. 28, 2001)]</font></font></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TRIZ (as pronounced like &quot;trees&quot; in
English) is the abbriviation of Russian &quot;Theory of Inventive Problem
Solving&quot;, i.e. a methodology for technical innovation developed first in
the former USSR.&nbsp; Mr. G. S. Altshuller obtained its first idea in 1946 and
have developed the methodology through the fifty years of collaboration with his
students/followers in the grass-root organizations.&nbsp; After the end of the
Cold War, TRIZ has become known to the West by a number of TRIZ specialists who
emigrated to USA and Europe.&nbsp; It has been accepted in the West with much
excitement and surprise.&nbsp; TRIZ has been introduced into Japan since 1997.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By reviewing the system of science and technology in
the bottom-up manner from technological practice, TRIZ has developed new system
of laws, such as the laws of evolution of technical systems, the principles of
invention, standard solutions for invention, etc.&nbsp; It recommends us to
analyze any technical problem to formulate contradictions, and then to solve the
contradictions without making any compromise.&nbsp; It gives us a new way of
thinking for achieving break-through solutions.&nbsp; The excellent and huge
knowledge-bases accumulated in the study of TRIZ have already been installed
into software tools which can work smoothly on PCs.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TRIZ is a powerful methodology having a huge system
of knowledge base and methods.&nbsp; So it takes rather a long time to penetrate
into industrial engineers.&nbsp; Thus there has been a number of attempts to
simpify the process of problem solving by fully adopting the essence of
TRIZ.&nbsp; USIT (i.e. 'Unified Structured Inventive Thinking') is one of such
simplified methodologies developed in USA.&nbsp; It recommends a simple yet
powerful process of problem solving, composed of three stages, i.e. Problem
definition, Problem analysis, and Concept generation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Japan, TRIZ has been introduced and promoted by
Nikkei Mechanical Journal, Mitsubishi Research Institute, Sanno Institute of
Management, Professor Hatamura's group at the University of Tokyo, and the
present author.&nbsp; There now appear a number of pioneering engineers in
various Japanese industries.&nbsp; The present author has established a Web site
for promoting TRIZ and USIT on a not-for-profit purpose and has been publicly
posting a number of information.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For reference to information on TRIZ, please visit
my Web site named 'TRIZ Home Page in Japan', which has English and Japanese
pages in parallel.&nbsp; Introductory articles on TRIZ posted in the Web site
would be useful for beginners in TRIZ.&nbsp; URL:&nbsp; http://www.osaka-gu.ac.jp/php/nakagawa/TRIZ/eTRIZ/<br>
