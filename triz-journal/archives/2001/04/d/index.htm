<p>ABSTRACT</p>
</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>Few if any dot-com businesses have attained profitable status. Most are still
riding a wave of massive investor confidence and happily talk about ‘burn-rate’
as a measure of success. This situation is unlikely to last for too much longer,
and sooner rather than later, someone is going to have to work out how to
engineer a sustainable profit from operating in a virtual environment. The paper
examines current e-business paradigms with respect to some of the contradictions
present, and suggest strategies emerging from ideality, the use of resources,
trends of evolution and TRIZ-derived Inventive Principles which may offer means
of breaking out of the current loss-making paradigms. Included are case studies
examining how paradigm-breaking solutions are beginning to be successfully
deployed in a number of forward thinking e-companies.</p>
</font><font size="2"></font><b><font face="Arial">
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>Like traditional businesses, dot-com companies need to attract increasing
numbers of prospects and keep customers away from the competition. However,
unlike their brick-and-mortar counterparts, they must do so in the digital
domain where customers can click to the competition instantly. They must
transact business at Internet speed, and many have started with inadequate
operational infrastructure in place to support the service that their customers
demand. Failure to provide that level of service has led to the somewhat
surprising success of the “bricks-and-clicks” enterprises over the pure dot-coms.</p>
<p>While much of the business-to-business environment is comprised of virtual
supply chains and innovative Web-based trading communities, dot-coms still need
to tap into the traditional infrastructure to keep business flowing. To relate
across the digital and the brick-and-mortar domains, they need to harness,
unite, and share information with everyone involved in their business processes.</p>
<p>Making money off the Web is more complicated than
&quot;point-and-click.&quot; E-business has concentrated on Web order capture.
Now it is in need of a ready-made connection between the Web order and the
logistics muscle capable of fulfilling that order. The paper explores some of
the conflicts present and suggests the contradiction-breaking types of IT
infrastructures businesses are likely to need in order to succeed in the
fast-moving, high-volume, high-expectation world of electronic commerce.</p>
<p>The Internet alone cannot currently transform business relationships and
bring about the electronic marketplace. What is needed in this scenario is a
strategic order-fulfillment process, including customer-focused steps such as
order generation, order receipt, order selection and prioritization, order
independence, and coordination of packing, shipping, and invoicing. Web-merchant
sites integrated with software that can efficiently manage high-volume order
fulfillment environments will be the first to establish flexible customer
response centers on the Web that not only fulfill orders for customers anywhere
in the world but do so profitably.</p>
<p>Logistics and supply chain management are critical success factors for every
electronic commerce company that plans to turn its business into a profitable
operation. Building a solid, yet flexible foundation will allow an e-business to
conduct full-scale electronic commerce today and well into the future.
Establishing the convenience and service levels customers demand, while
carefully integrating the supply chain efficiency and scalability businesses
need to drive revenue and remain competitive, will propel the next wave of
e-business leaders and position them for future success only if the current
contradictions can be eliminated.</p>
<p>The paper explores some of these contradictions, and the alternative
e-business scenario in which Internet-only solutions might be made to become a
viable option. An important element in this regard surrounds the contradiction
between ease of access to the Internet and the consequent ease of being copied
by a competitor. The paper examines this and other related contradictions and
explores how TRIZ may be used to create suitable ‘barriers to entry’ to ward
off competitors.</p>
<p>The paper includes example scenarios illustrating how dot com companies might
be expected to evolve and grow in the light of the new operating paradigms
suggested by TRIZ strategies.</p>
<p>TRIZ tools and rules have emerged from studying how people solve problems.
Reference Drucker’s definition of a customer, E-businesses have been created
to solve their customers’ problems. Therefore, it should be no surprise that
successful e-businesses look like examples of TRIZ applications. We have,
therefore, sequenced the sections of the paper in order of the different TRIZ
tools, looking at case studies from different e-businesses along the way.</p>
</font><b><font face="Arial">
<p>IDEAL FINAL RESULT</p>
</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>If we accept the concept of increasing ideality as the over-riding trend of
technology evolution, then we must see moves from ‘bricks and mortar’ based
business towards increasing use of virtual solutions as being a highly logical
progression. The ultimate limit of ‘ideality’ is the Ideal Final Result (IFR)
concept. The IFR is a simple and yet profound concept which says that systems
will evolve to deliver all of the customer desired benefits, without any costs
or harms. Without actually using the term IFR, the concept lies at the very
heart of the <i>book ‘Free, Perfect and Now</i>’ (Reference 1).</p>
<p>‘<i>Free, Perfect &amp; Now</i>’ centres around Marshall Industries -
essentially an intermediary in the supply chain between manufacturer and end
customer. If IFR says there ought to be no place for intermediaries, the book
provides an object lesson in how such organisations survive and thrive in the
market by essentially delivering to end users the new function of ‘navigation’
- i.e. they manage the complexity which results from a rapidly globalising
market-place and the ensuing availability of massive numbers of manufacturers
offering massive amounts of information about the products they produce. We will
return to the issue of the navigator when we look at how the Contradictions part
of TRIZ might effect the role and/or existence of intermediary companies.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we examine a number of other examples of ideality and the
IFR concept in action in the e-business community:</p>
<p>A modest example of the generation of a strategy directly from the IFR is
Barnes and Noble’s holiday delivery policy. The IFR (from the customer’s
point of view) is:</p>
<div align="left">
  <center>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
    <tr>
      <td><font face="Arial" size="2">
        <p align="left">I buy books with no effort.</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>Implicit in this is that the cost is equal to or less than the “effort.”
By offering a policy of no delivery charges during the holiday season, B&amp;N
gives the customer to opportunity to buy books without the effort of visiting a
bookstore, and without the delivery cost that usually makes the on-line purchase
equal the price in the stores. Of course, as with all on-line shopping, the site
must be easy to use and the delivery process flawless to meet the customers’
full IFR.</p>
</font><font face="Arial"></font><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>Another example of the direct generation of a product concept from the IFR is
the emerging technology of fuel cells for portable telephones. The IFR is:</p>
<div align="left">
  <center>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
    <tr>
      <td><font face="Arial" size="2">
        <p align="left">I want to communicate anytime, anyplace, with no
        effort.</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>The wireless phone satisfies the “anyplace” requirement, if enough
antennas and switching stations have been built. But, the “anytime”
requirement is not met, since the phone requires recharging, and the charging
station is either stationary or attached to a vehicle. Battery technologies have
been improving rapidly, with shorter recharging times and longer time between
charges announced almost weekly.</p>
<p>An alternative to batteries was recently developed, attempting to move closer
to the IFR. SRI announced a fuel cell technology that uses PEM, Proton Exchange
Membrane technology, using methanol as the fuel, in exchangeable cells
(Reference 2). The first version lasts five times as long as a typical battery.
Although the need to change and recycle fuel cells does not fulfill the IFR (the
phone is unavailable during the change, and the user must carry the spare cell,
or be restricted in his/her location for use of the phone) this technology is an
alternative way of achieving the IFR.</p>
<p>In another example, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the founders of search engine
e-business Google.com define their mission as “We want to access everything
available, all over the world, in all languages.” (Reference 2). To achieve
this ideal final result, they have just added Chinese and Korean language
capability to their system, which uses 6000 computers in the world’s largest
Linux installation to search over 1 billion (10<sup>9</sup>) Web pages in one
second. For reference, they point out that if these Web pages were printed out,
they would make a stack 100 Km high!</p>
<p>For the future, their research team is defining the ideal search engine. “It
will be a smart tool that understands exactly what you want, understands all the
information on the Web, and then it gives you exactly the right thing.” Their
research has generated a list of improvements needed to move from their present
method to this ideal system, and their development strategy is to work their way
through the list.</p>
<p>In a humorous aside, they acknowledge the technical contradiction of their
management (2 27-year old technical guys running the top search company on the
web, with lots of algorithm and networking experience but no management
experience.) They express it as a trade-off between “technological savvy and
organizational savvy” and, for now, they and their investors are not resolving
the contradiction; they are sticking with technological savvy.</p>
<p>Other e-business paradigms so far appear to have paid less heed to the
concept of IFR, at least from the perspective of the customer. On-line grocery
shopping is perhaps a good example of a sector where although ideality has been
increased (assuming web-sites have achieved an acceptable level of use-ability)
over physically having to visit a supermarket, it is still some considerable
distance away from what might be classified as an IFR.</p>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="index.1.gif" width="470" height="316"><br>
</font><b>Figure 1: IFR and ‘Grocery Shopping’ from a Customer Perspective</p>
</b><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>Figure 1 illustrates the strategy of first defining IFR and then stepping
back from this only when it is deemed that it cannot be achieved. In the case of
grocery shopping, we might see the important word ‘self’ as a key driver,
i.e. ideally, I would like the shopping to do itself - the store works out what
I need and delivers it to me, when I want it, at the price I’m prepared to
pay. While some supermarkets may be seen to be making tentative steps in this
general direction (e.g. on-line accounts which recognise that most customer
grocery orders are made up of over 80% staple, regular order items and thus
contain ‘you are low on sugar, I have added some to your basket’
algorithms), none have as yet made a very good link to the ultimate function
being delivered. What we mean here is that a carrier bag full of items from the
store is not the ultimate (customer) functional requirement; a better customer
IFR requirement is to have a specified meal on the table for a specified number
of people on a specified date, at a specified time. The first on-line shopping
facility offering translation of a meal specification into a basketful of
delivered ingredients might provide for itself a significant value-adding edge.</p>
<p>If most e-businesses are failing to make profit at the moment, it may be seen
to be in large part due to the fact that they are trying to evolve things from
left to right - the way we usually do things - on the Figure 1 picture, rather
than starting from the right and working left. In other words, e-business cannot
hope to prosper by replicating the traditional bricks and mortar business model,
but at a lower cost. Instead it must seek to add value - increase ideality - by
offering customers tangible benefits that do not or cannot exist in the
non-virtual world.</p>
<p>Priceline.com and similar companies perhaps offers some insight into how this
concept might begin to work in practice. With Priceline, the customer defines
his or her own ‘IFR’ by defining how much they are prepared to pay for a
given product or service and then soliciting bids from prospective suppliers.
While this is an obvious step in the right direction as far as customers are
concerned, the business model is currently too limiting and clearly still doesn’t
work in certain sectors (e.g. groceries, fuel) where fixed costs are a small
proportion of total cost. For airline seats, hotel rooms, cinema seats, concert
tickets, etc - where fixed costs are a high proportion of total cost - and
suppliers have a much greater incentive to fill all empty seats the model
appears to have the potential to work much more effectively. Perhaps this
scenario suggests that evolution towards ideality will happen most quickly when
the conflict between the IFR of the supplier and the IFR of the customer is at
its smallest.</p>
</font><b><font face="Arial"><sup></sup>
<p>CONTRADICTIONS</p>
<p></font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">Use of the IFR thought process often
helps to identify the contradictions which prevent the IFR from being achieved.
A classic example emerges from the work of Evans and Wurster in their book ‘<i>Blown
To Bits</i>’ (Reference 3). The book considers how the information-age affects
the ability of companies to target information, like google.com above,
specifically to the needs of every individual customer. <i>Blown To Bits</i>
identifies the contradiction between ‘richness’ (the quality and relevance
of information received by each individual) and ‘reach’ (the number of
individuals the information reaches. Figure 2 illustrates how the richness
versus reach contradiction is traditionally viewed as a one-or-the-other
relationship, such that the more I have of one parameter, the less I must accept
of the other.</p>
<sup></sup></font><sup><b></b></sup><b>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="index.2.gif" width="576" height="340"><br>
Figure 2: Richness versus Reach Contradiction for Share Dealing</p>
</b><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>The figure is drawn for the example given in <i>Blown To Bits</i> of share
dealing. Traditional richness versus reach trades mean that when Schwab
introduced telephone broking in the 1970s, it was an inherent compromise - more
people had access to share dealing services, but the quality of information (‘richness’)
they received from a phone operator as opposed to a full-service broker was
inherently compromised. Further evolution to 24 hour, touch-tone dial-in from
the late 1980s was a further step towards greater reach by further compromising
richness.</p>
<p>TRIZ, of course, tells us not to accept the compromises, and a large part of
the message of <i>Blown To Bits</i> is that the Internet is the thing that has
broken the contradiction not just for share dealing - Figure 3 - but for a
variety of other industry sectors as well. In the case of Schwab’s share
dealing activities, <i>Blown To Bits</i> argues that Internet dealing now offers
enormous reach with a richness (thanks to data mining and on-line data
acquisition strategies) that is better than that available from just about any
individual full-service dealer. In other words, the Internet has made available
to the general public just about all of the data available to the full-service
dealer when he or she is making decisions on the behalf of a client.</p>
<sup></sup></font><sup><b></b></sup><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="index.3.gif" width="403" height="334"><br>
</font><b>Figure 3: Richness versus Reach Contradiction Broken by the Internet</p>
</b><font face="Arial" size="2"><sup></sup>
<p>Figure 3 shows how the Internet has shifted the traditional contradiction
inherent in the hyperbolic curve. The idea of shifting the curve rather than
accepting its position was first discussed in Reference 4, in describing ‘Contradiction
Chains’. The main thesis of the Contradiction Chains article was that the
shifting curves idea extended well beyond just two curves, and that the
elimination of one contradiction merely serves to bring to the fore other
contradictions. Thus although the Internet has to a large extent ‘solved’
the richness versus reach contradiction, Contradiction Chains say that the new
paradigm also eventually hits a new contradiction which has to be solved if
ideality is to increase further. Figure 4 illustrates the concept and suggests
that the new contradiction emerging from the Internet solution of the richness
versus reach contradiction is the ‘too much information; too little time to
process it’ contradiction.</p>
<p>At the present time, this contradiction is being handled (as opposed to
solved) by a wave of e-businesses offering navigation capabilities to customers
without the ability or will to navigate the massive amounts of information
available themselves.</p>
</font><sup><b></b></sup><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>Navigators beware though, because it would appear likely that the emergence
of ‘semantic processing’ capabilities offer the potential for if not
completely solving the contradiction, at least shifting the hyperbolic curve
closer to overall ideality. We await the next contradiction emerging from
semantic processing with interest.</p>

</font><b><sup></sup>
<p align="left">Figure 4: Solve One Contradiction and Another Emerges</p>
</b><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>The world of e-business abounds with physical as well as the technical
contradictions seen above. A basic one is:</p>
<div align="left">
  <center>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
    <tr>
      <td><font face="Arial" size="2">
        <p align="left">I want lots of inventory but I want no inventory.</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>I want lots of inventory to have many choices for my customers ready to ship
as soon as the customer orders something, but I want no inventory to have no
carrying costs, no warehousing costs, and no surplus inventory if a particular
product is not popular.</p>
<p>A large family of solutions called “b-webs” for “Business webs” have
been created to resolve this contradiction, using the solution method of going
to the super-system. A b-web consists of customers, suppliers and the organizing
company, linked so that a customer order triggers suppliers to provide the parts
needed to build that specific order. The organizing company holds no inventory,
and the suppliers hold much less inventory than in conventional relationships.
Dell Computers is considered the archetype of the b-web business. They hold less
than 3 days inventory at any time, and ship orders less than 24 hours after they
are received. Office Depot claims that switching to the b-web model saved it
US$600 million the first year (Reference 5).</p>
</font><sup></sup><b><font face="Arial">
<p>40 Inventive Principles</p>
</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>Previous work (Reference 6) has shown that the business world appears to
require the same 40 Inventive Principles used to solve technical problems. This
paper continues the theme by suggesting that the same 40 Principles are relevant
in an e-business context. We also submit that we have not identified a
contradiction breaking principle being used by any e-business that does not fit
the framework provided by the current list of 40.</p>
<p>Below are some of the examples found of Inventive Principles being applied in
an e-business context:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>The above richness versus reach contradiction has been solved by the
    Internet adopting Principle 6, Universality (i.e. the Internet offers a
    truly universal communication medium), and a Parameter Change (Principle 35)
    from a physical to a virtual infra-structure.</li>
  <li>The semantic processors which hopefully begin to solve the ‘amount of
    information versus time to process it’ contradiction are using Inventive
    Principle 2, Taking Out - in that they are separating the useful information
    from the noise.</li>
  <li>Navigators, like Marshall, are examples of Principle 24 - Intermediary.</li>
  <li>Reference 7 describes how Ford are using Principles 5 - merging, 20 -
    continuity of useful action, 24 - intermediary, 3 - local quality -
    adopt/adapt/reject based on local conditions in their RAPID programme for
    enabling all parts of their global organisation to have access to (and the
    ability to filter for local relevance) the good practices developed in other
    parts of the organisation.</li>
  <li>eyetracking.com uses a sensor to examine where, how and when our eyes
    travel around a computer screen filled with information in order to help
    web-site designers to identify the best places to position different aspects
    of the data required to be presented - in other words, to provide
    eye-tracking data provides Inventive Principle 3, Local Quality information
    (eyetracking.com itself is using Principles 23 Feedback, and 28 Replacement
    with a field). One eyetracking finding, for example, is that when a new
    screen full of information appears, our eyes tend to start at the centre of
    the screen, and so we should position the information required first in a
    sequence to be positioned in this area.</li>
  <li>The concept of viral marketing as pioneered by Hotmail.com (also Reference
    7) - i.e. the offering of free e-mails to users where the free e-mail comes
    with a (subtle) advertisement for hotmail is a good example of Principle 25,
    Self-Service, being a clever way of targeting a highly focused audience of
    relevant users.</li>
</ul>
</font><sup>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</sup><b><font face="Arial">
<p>76 STANDARD SOLUTIONS</p>
</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>The idea of viral marketing described above also serves to illustrate the
relevance of Su-Field analysis techniques when considering e-business issues.
Reference 7, for example describes how viral marketing, starting from a Chained
Su-Field to create demand, then goes too far such that a harmful effect (privacy
invasion) emerges - this in turn creates a new Su-Field problem.</p>
<p>Viral marketing is an e-business technique that is spreading like the common
cold. It is successful, and it is being used to market everything from
telecommunications plans to personal products like soap and shampoo. The
originators may have been the free e-mail Hotmail system, which went from
concept to 11 million users in 18 months by adding a message at the bottom of
each e-mail that advertises the service.</p>
<p>But, some viral marketers have gone too far. They have used the data from the
referrals to study the purchasing patterns of their customers in ways that
customers consider invasion of privacy. In TRIZ terms, they have linked Su-field
models</p>
<div align="left">
  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">

        collection of data</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>Companies that have been successful with viral marketing have avoided this
last step. Some have tried to provide such high value that the customers
contribute the data themselves, with mixed success. Viral marketing is in its
infancy, and its practitioners are still searching for the “X factor” that
can make these chains of functions all succeed.</p>
</font><sup></sup><b><font face="Arial">
<p>PATTERNS OF EVOLUTION</p>
</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>The richness versus reach contradiction and the desire for rich bespoke data
to be delivered to every individual customer is highly consistent with the trend
of evolution in which systems evolve from the macro to the micro-scale. This
trend is dominant across a massive range of business systems in the form of ‘mass
customization’ (Reference 8)</p>
<p>Many e-businesses are also following the trends of evolution of the pattern
called “decreasing human interaction” or “increasing automation”
(Reference 9). The pattern can be summarized as follows:</p>
<sup></sup></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
</p><ol>
  <li>Human does the work</li>
  <li>Human with tool does the work</li>
  <li>Human with tool set, selects the right tool and does the work</li>
  <li>Human directs tool; the tool does the work</li>
  <li>Tool works, modified by human when needed</li>
  <li>Tool adapts itself to situation; tool does the work, learns from the
    experience, and modifies itself and the work it does as needed</li>
</ol>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">
<p>The PointCast system was an example of levels 4, 5 and 6 of this pattern. The
basic premise underlying PointCast is that the customer designates what news she
wants to receive during the day. A typical request might be prices of certain
stocks, news of particular sports teams, news that affects her business issues,
and local politics for her city. The PointCast system updated a personal “newspaper”
with these topics throughout the day (hence the name “PointCast” as opposed
to “Broadcast” news.). But, PointCast took the system further. It would
include articles on subjects related to the requested subjects, but not
specifically requested. If the customer spent time reading these, the system
would send more on those subjects. Likewise, if the customer did not spend time
on these extra subjects, the system would try different subjects. Also, if the
customer did not read the articles that she had requested, the system would
gradually stop sending them, and substitute additional articles on other
subjects.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the PointCast model is economically viable.
Although highly consistent with the trends of evolution and an increase in
overall user perceived ideality, it is not clear how the company can earn enough
revenue to meet the cost of providing what is undoubtedly a powerful capability.</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">
<p>Many if not all e-businesses are evolving in directions consistent with the
strategies suggested by TRIZ trends of evolution. They are all to varying
degrees changing the business paradigm through the use of Inventive Principles 6
and 35 to ‘eliminate’ contradictions associated with bricks and mortar
centred businesses. This paradigm shift alone however, is patently not enough
because few if any e-businesses have yet returned a profit.</p>
</font><sup><font size="2" color="#000000"></font></sup><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">
<p>Financial success of e-business may not be well correlated with technical
success because of the immaturity of the business models. Utterback’s book <i>Mastering
the Dynamics of Innovation</i> (Reference 10) illustrates a common historical
trend regarding major innovations and new markets which shows that the number of
offerers in the market increases markedly during the infancy period of a market
and that very few expect to turn a profit until the market begins to mature. It
is at this point also that the number of offerers begins to decline sharply. The
correlation between market maturity S-curve and ‘number of players is
