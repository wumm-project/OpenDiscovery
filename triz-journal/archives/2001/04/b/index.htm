<h1>The TRIZ Challenges</h1>

<p align="left">Ian Care</p>
<p>As an experiment, we are setting some &quot;TRIZ challenges&quot; to
challenge you to use your TRIZ skills and your knowledge to help to solve a
humanitarian or social problem.</p>
<p>We hope that you will submit your results for publication in the TRIZ
journal. Comments on any of the challenges are welcome. If you are a student,
you may want to take and research a challenge to solve as part of your course or
project work.</p>
<p>Send your results, ideas, comments and suggestions for future challenges to <a href="mailto:challenge@triz-journal.com">challenge@triz-journal.com</a>.</p>
<p>Genrich Altshuller gave us TRIZ for free, now it is our turn to use TRIZ for
the benefit of the world and our fellow creatures. We hope that you all will
rise to one of our challenges this year, and that you will enjoy solving the
problems.</p>
