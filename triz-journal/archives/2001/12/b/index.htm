<p>Introduction</p>
</b>
<p>In the last article we discussed some of the problems that can occur when we
place ourselves ‘outside’ the 9 windows of the system operator, and how we can
overcome those problems. In this article, we look at why this separation takes
place and how our understanding of this ‘why’ can influence a range of problem
and opportunity situations. In examining this situation, we will also see how
TRIZ can benefit by integrating similar but in many ways more fully developed
tools from Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), and how this integration can, in
turn, influence how we define and solve problems. </p>

<p>Another Dimension</p>
</b><font FACE="Times New Roman"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p>We use an isometric view of the classical 9 Windows - as illustrated in
Figure 1 - to begin examining what might happen when we follow the advice of the
TRIZ geometric evolution trend, and move out of the two-dimensional model
perspective and begin to actively use the third dimension.</p>

</b></font>
<p>A useful first question, then, might be, what can we usefully use this third
dimension to express? A very good answer comes from NLP and the work of Robert
Dilts (1) who first drew a version of the picture reproduced in Figure 2. If the
classical 9 windows describe a SPACE - TIME plane, then Dilts suggested that the
third plane should describe the different levels of human awareness. The first
plane represents physical actuality. Successive planes then represent a
hierarchy of awareness of the way we perceive and are affected by that physical
reality, from first the way we behave in response to the actuality, right up to
how our identity is affected by the actuality. </p>

</b></font>
<p>A detailed discussion of the deep philosophical issues potentially raised by
this picture is somewhat beyond the scope of this article; the reference is a
far better next step for anyone interested. We, on the other hand will see what
we might extract from the image that might help us in a practical problem
solving sense. </p>
<p>(By way of a short intrusion, however, Dilts actually uses first, second and
third person to represent what the system operator defines as sub-system, system
and super-system respectively. This too can add an interesting perspective to
the way we use the 9-Windows, albeit one also beyond the scope of this article.)</p>
<p>Many engineers are instinctively comfortable with the 9-windows, ‘thinking in
time and space’ idea. Indeed, the design of physical things is highly amenable
to this kind of world-view. Many management and ‘people’ problems, on the other
hand are not so amenable to successful treatment by such a two-dimensional
perspective (this is not to say that engineers make bad managers of course!).
Such ‘people’ related problems demand that all of the issues associated with
human behaviour have to be considered if we are going to successfully define and
solve the real problem. In the NLP view, this means looking at all five levels.
In terms of management type problems, just using two would represent a
significant advance on the way most problems are viewed and dealt with today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>The Map and The Territory</p>
</b>
<p>Using the bottom two of the five system operator ‘levels’ - the ‘physical’
plane and the ‘behaviour’ plane (Figure 3) - should straightaway get us to
recognize that potential for differences between the ‘actual’ and our perception
of that actual. In more common parlance, the two planes represent the
‘territory’ and a ‘map’; the territory is what actually exists, while the map
represents an opinion of what the territory looks like. Sometimes these two
things are closely aligned, and sometimes they are not. When they are not, we
have the basis of a contradiction. And once we have a contradiction, we have the
ability to use TRIZ and other tools to help improve the situation.</p>

<p>Common ‘Map versus Territory’ Differences</p>
</b>
<p>The management literature is literally full to brimming with examples of
contradictions emerging as a result of differences between map and territory. A
particularly fine collection of examples may be found in the ‘decoding the
corporate culture’ chapter in Reference 2. Author Eileen Shapiro describes the
‘internal game’:</p>

<p>Awareness of the ‘internal game’ contradictions is not a solution of course;
but recognition of the map-territory contradictions is at least a start.</p>
<b>
<p>Marks and Spencer</p>
</b>
<p>M&amp;S have traditionally positioned themselves at the high-end of the high
street chain store market. The map of their customer base has traditionally
consisted of the aspirant middle-class family, and their competitors are other
high street chains. In terms of the classic benefits versus price trade-off of
the retail sector, they hold a solid middle-ground position.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in recent times, it has become apparent that the
benefits-versus-price map for high-street stores - the map drawn by M&amp;S - is
somewhat different from the substantially bigger retailing benefit versus price
territory. The difference is highlighted in Figure 4.</p>
<font SIZE="2"></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p>By no means uniquely - in fact we can observe very similar maps drawn by
companies in a variety of markets from household to bodycare, from automobiles
to airlines - the territory turns out to be a threat to the middle ground
business. In the case of M&amp;S, the territory actually also contains private-label
goods at the low-price end of the benefits-price spectrum, and a number of
niches, but most notably ‘little luxuries’ at the other end (see Reference 3 for
more detailed discussion of this trend). In this bigger picture context, M&amp;S is
actually a rather small player, and, unless it recognizes the difference between
their map and the territory, will get smaller as the private label and
‘little-luxury’ players gradually encroach further and further onto the M&amp;S map
as all associated trends say they will.</p>

</b>
<p align="left">(the blue oval is taken to represent the M&amp;S super-system in
its most general sense in terms of past, present and future definitions of time)</p>
<b></b></font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(A simple yet surprisingly effective remedy to the type of situation M&amp;S now
finds itself in is to use Principle 13 and ask the question ‘<font COLOR="#0000ff">who
doesn’t buy our products?</font>’ The roots of increased market share usually
exist outside the existing customer base.)</p>
<b>
<p>John - The Insensitive Line Manager</p>
</b>
<p>By way of another example of the problems that can be caused by the
differences between map and territory, we look again at a well known TRIZ case
study - the insensitive line manager problem first discussed in Reference 4.
Essentially the problem comes about as a result of the causal map described in
Figure 5.</p>
<font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="02e.gif" width="500" height="214"></p>
<p align="left">Figure 5: The Insensitive Line Manager </p>
</b></font>
<p>The core conflict is that John channels all resources under his control
towards meeting the group’s goals but he does this in a style that demoralises
and renders ineffective other organisational goals. The previous TRIZ analysis
detailed in Reference 4 presents a rather crude application of Inventive
Principles to try and solve the contradiction ‘John should be present and
not-present’. As subsequently discussed in Reference 5, stronger solutions will
emerge by obtaining a better understanding of the root causes underlying the
contradiction. It is suggested here that understanding of the problem can be
further improved by recognising the differences between not just ‘map’ and
‘territory’, but also that different participants draw different maps. The point
is illustrated in Figure 6 below.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="02f.gif" width="500" height="215"></p>
</font><font SIZE="2"><b>
<p align="left">Figure 6: The Insensitive Line Manager - Multiple Maps of One
Territory</p>
</b></font>
<p>Given this picture, it should become possible to provide a basis for allowing
everyone involved in the problem to see what is happening. It also helps us to
identify not just the ‘John should be present and not-present’ contradiction,
but also other - perhaps more appropriately tackled - contradictions like John’s
map versus the territory, and everyone else’s map(s) versus the territory. Given
the scenario, for example, in which the map versus territory picture is used to
point out to John that the ‘optimization’ of his part of the business has a
negative part on other parts of the other business with potentially net negative
effect, it is difficult to see how he could continue doing what he is doing -
certainly if his wish to do his best for the organisation is true. Rather than
using the issue to berate John, the map-versus-territory concept also presents
the opportunity to let him see a ‘bigger-picture’ view of the total business -
i.e. the situation can be resolved in a win-win manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Discussion</p>
</b>
<p>In its original form, the 9-Windows system operator, whether intentionally or
otherwise, separates us from the problem; we are encouraged to see it from
‘outside’ each of the windows; we look into the windows. This outsider’s
perspective can be very useful, but what we have discussed here is that the
outsider’s perspective is a <i>map</i> of a <i>territory</i> - and is therefore
coloured by personal perspectives.</p>
<p>Different people will draw different maps of the territory. ‘Different maps’
represent the root of disagreement and contradiction. Awareness of these
differences - through awareness of a third dimension in the system operator -
offers at least the potential of better understanding of how conflicts arise,
and thus how we might apply TRIZ and other tools to resolve them.</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</b>
<p>In the final installment of this series of articles exploring the system
operator, we will be examining how some other non-TRIZ tools can be integrated
with the 9-Windows concept to the mutual benefit of users of both TRIZ and those
non-TRIZ tools.</p>
