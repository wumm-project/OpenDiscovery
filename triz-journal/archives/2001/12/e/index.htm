<p>The first conference of the European TRIZ Association was held in Bath, in
the UK, November 7-9, 2001. I participated in the conference, and regard it as a
great success. The TRIZ Journal’s most prolific author, Darrell Mann, was the
chairman of the event, and Professor Julian Vincent at the University of Bath
was the sponsor. The TRIZ community owes a great vote of thanks to them for
making it possible for more than 50 people from Europe, Korea, Japan and the US
to get together to share their TRIZ stories and to develop more knowledge of how
to use TRIZ</p>

<p>For those of you who were not there, you will have several ways to learn
about what happened in the beautiful city of Bath.</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>The TRIZ Journal will publish many of the papers. ETRIA was generous in
  arranging for each author to own his/her copyright, so that arranging for
  re-publication is easy. We start in this issue with the paper by Bruno Ruchti
  (see photo) and Pavel Livotov, and plan to have 2-3 papers in each issue for
  the next several months.</li>
  <li>Professor Toru Nakagawa (see photo, below) has published a summary of the
  meeting, and summaries of many of the papers in English on his TRIZ Home Page
  in Japan,

<p>Start planning now to attend the Altshuller Institute Conference,
TRIZCON2002, in St. Louis, MO, USA, in April, 2002, and the second meeting of
ETRIA in Strasbourg, France, in November, 2002 (See the Calendar Page of The
TRIZ Journal for information, and the Welcome Letter for frequent nagging from
your editors.) Reading the papers does<i><b> not</b></i> give you the same
experience as attending the conference. The mix of TRIZ experts, TRIZ beginners,
and TRIZ practitioners from industry, consulting, and academia gave rise to many
discussions of the way people use (and misuse!) TRIZ, the future of TRIZ, and
the relationships between TRIZ and other disciplines, which will be the start of
ongoing dialogue and learning. </p>

<p>Su-Dong Park has started a Korean TRIZ portal,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.triznik.com">http://www.triznik.com</a>.
This site is in the Korean language only, and is intended to help people learn
TRIZ. Mr. Park is a graduate student in the Technology Innovation Laboratory of
the Department of Industrial Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University. Anyone with
questions about the site can contact Mr. Park at

<p>Darrell Mann announced at the ETRIA meeting that the Journal of Creativity
and Innovation Management will feature one TRIZ paper in each issue, and will
have a special issue on TRIZ later this year. For more information, or to submit
a paper, write to him at <a href="mailto:ensdlm@bath.ac.uk">ensdlm@bath.ac.uk</a>.
The first issue will have a paper from TRIZ Journal co-editor Michael Slocum and
his collaborator Catherine Lundberg of the Ontro Corporation (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ontro.com">www.ontro.com</a>).
They have expanded the article on Technology Forecasting that appeared in our
special issue on Food Technology, October 2001, to include a review of eight
other methods of technology forecasting.</p>
