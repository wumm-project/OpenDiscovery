<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This body of work was undertaken as a four-month final year
project for an Engineering student under the tutelage of Darrell Mann at the
University of Bath. The following article is therefore condensed from a larger
report entitled “An investigation into new approaches to the design of economy
flight cabins”, available at the university.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. INTRODUCTION and BACKGROUND</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aircraft passenger flight at its first inception in the
1910’s and 20’s was a luxury afforded to few and conditions for passengers were
primitive and uncomfortable. However, the swift technical development of
aircraft and in particular, propulsion systems, during this period allowed for
the use of progressively larger payload bays and therefore greater opportunities
for air transport companies. By the early 1950’s the jet engine had been
introduced to commercial aircraft and airlines thus recognised that the
economics of flight now favoured cheap fares and increased throughput. Passenger
numbers since have steadily increased and so far show no signs of levelling off.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To accommodate this growing demand, the size of the passenger
cabin must grow or the number of passengers per cabin must improve. In the first
case, increasing the cabin size requires more powerful engines, larger
fuselages, larger airports, and so on. Eventually, a fundamental limit is
reached in that the aeroplane outgrows the theoretical 100m<sup>2</sup> docking bay
area restriction at each of the worlds’ airports. Alternatively, packing the
cabin with as many fare-payers as possible has clear drawbacks: more rows of
seats means less space per row, and therefore cramped conditions, long periods
of immobility and difficult access to and from the aisle.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only limited research on cabin design has been undertaken,
and is often difficult to locate.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Approach</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was decided that TRIZ was a suitable method to apply to
the problem of economy flight cabins, and it was hoped that such an
investigation might indicate the effectiveness of TRIZ in this situation and
therefore highlight any limitations of the method.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In light of passenger comfort issues, it seems apparent that
the aircraft seat would be the focus for research. TRIZ psychological inertia
tools indicate that <i>the environment in which the system operates</i> and also
<i>features of the system</i>, should also be considered. Hence, there are three
‘system levels’ (figure 1.1):</p>
      <i>
      </p><ul>
        <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Super-system</i> - the seat environment, i.e. the
      aircraft fuselage</p>
        </li>
      <i>
        <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">System</i> - (the seat)</p>
        </li>
      <i>
        <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sub-system</i> - features of the seat, e.g. armrests,
      food trays etc.</p>
        </li>
</ul>

</font>
<p align="left">figure 1.1</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An existing aircraft design with fixed major fuselage
dimensions/features was used as the basis for research. For the purpose of
brevity, the discussion here will be limited to consideration of super-system
and system level analyses.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. THE ‘SUPER-SYSTEM’ LEVEL</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Passenger cabin functionality increased considerably
throughout the 1920’s. A decrease in development since the 1960’s has left the
cabin subsequently unaltered: seats are typically arranged facing forwards in
uniform rows and columns. It seems that aircraft manufacturers have concluded
that this is the best solution to the problem of accommodating passengers within
the fuselage shape.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The s-curve indicates that the super-system is at a mature
stage of its life-cycle (figure 2.1).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contradictions</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aircraft fuselage is a highly optimised system - most of
the available space has been utilised and therefore available floor area
problems arise for passengers due to this volume restriction in the cabin. A
relevant super-system contradiction is therefore:</p>

</blockquote>
</i></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interpretations of inventive principles included the
following:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<i><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Asymmetry</p>
</b></i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Asymmetry was found to be the most useful and productive
trigger of the four solutions suggested. The aircraft cabin is a highly
symmetrical system and it follows that by experimenting with asymmetry many
interesting and novel solutions are discovered.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The starting point is a standard seat layout with all seats
arranged in rows facing forwards (6 seats are shown, figure 2.2, N<u>o</u> 1).</p>
<p align="left">
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<img SRC="Image188.gif" width="537" height="134"></font></p>
<p align="left">figure 2.2</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing asymmetry (N<u>o</u> 2) is beneficial since
facing passengers can ‘share’ legroom and have more space. Increasing asymmetry
by offsetting the facing rows such that the legs will mesh (N<u>o</u> 3) solves
problems due to the clashing of knees across opposing passengers. Hence, the
shape occupied by each person improves and it is easy to imagine how this
intelligent use of the available space may have increased benefits. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this layout were deployed in a familiar straight row
manner, one seat is lost per row due to the wasted space at the end of each row
caused by offsetting the seats (equating to around 45 fewer seats in a 747 - an
unacceptable loss). Extending asymmetry principles to the <i>aisle</i> helps to
overcome this. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Figure 2.3 shows that other layouts can be achieved by
altering the asymmetry further. However, any added value over previous schemes
is countered by an increase in complexity.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<i><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another dimension</p>
</b></i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The layout of seats in an aircraft is usually imagined in
plan view (as above), thus ignoring the third dimension, <i>height</i>. Although
the contradiction matrix suggests that this might be exploited, the creation of
concepts is greatly hindered by constraints on the absolute height within the
cabin. Thus, any solutions whereby passengers are tessellated in the vertical
plane soon prove unachievable except if the ‘lay the object on its side’ trigger
is employed: From this it was decided that a segmented sleeping section of the
plane could incorporate ‘sleeping capsules’ similar to those found in Japanese
‘capsule hotels’ (figure 2.5), since passengers can be tessellated more ideally
whilst lying horizontally.</p>

<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nested doll</p>
</i></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ‘nested doll’ inventive principle implies the movement of
objects in relation to or inside one another, or, more abstractly, if space has
already been used <i>once</i>, the key to solving the comfort problem might lie
in using it <i>twice</i>.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A typical 10-abreast economy seating arrangement from a
Boeing-747 is shown in figure 2.6. The gap in front of each seat is highlighted
in yellow and the aisle in orange. All seats face forwards.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left">
<img SRC="Image191.gif" width="591" height="256"></p>
</font>
<p align="left">figure 2.6</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The gap in front of each seat and the aisle can be combined
by seating the passengers sideways. Unfortunately, anybody using the aisle would
have to pick his or her way through a long row of legs- a clear disadvantage.
This may be solved, however, by re-applying the ‘another dimension’ trigger and
<i>raising the aisle</i>. The legs of passengers are accommodated underneath
(‘within’) the aisle (figure 2.7). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some benefits of this scheme are:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">greatly increased legroom - <i>legs can extend to
      underneath the opposite seat on reclination </i>(figure 2.8)</p>
      </li>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">instant access to/from aisle - <i>accessing the toilet
      causes no disturbance to others, exercise becomes easier</p>
      </li>
      </i>
      <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">improved access to passengers for cabin crew - <i>only
      minimal reaching required</p>
      </li>
      </i>
      <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">four aisles rather than two- <i>decreased evacuation
      time, more space for exercise, decreased blockages</p>

<font COLOR="#ff00ff"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trends</p>
</b></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A <i>mono-bi-poly</i> trend was recognised in that functions
offered by ‘cabin components’ such as lounges, bars, restaurants etc. have
become merged with that of the passenger seat over time. Passengers nowadays
typically sleep, work, and are entertained in their chairs. An example of how
further developments might be made, is passengers ‘preparing’ their own food (by
bringing it onto the plane from a selection in the waiting lounge or by
pre-storage of food in food-tray vacuum cavities) and thus allowing removal of
the galley. This can be seen as an example of trimming (figure 2.9).</p>

<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. ‘SYSTEM’ LEVEL</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Development of the aircraft seat itself has not been
extensive by any means. What started as a bamboo or wicker chair has evolved
only so far as an aluminium frame covered with foam padding, and this has
remained the same for perhaps twenty years. This increase in strength of the
chair has largely been a response to tightening safety regulations.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The system-level ‘seat’ s-curve remains in a position of
neither infancy or maturity, and problems have emerged because the function is
not being satisfactorily delivered: many can sympathise with the annoyances
caused by cramped leg room, limited width for the hips and inadequate back
support during long flights.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Presented with this situation, TRIZ knowledge[1] is vague in
that it states that the sequence of tools is probably unimportant. Using
experience a less random approach was devised:</p>
<i>
</p><ol>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trends -since evolutionary information is easy to
      extract from research</p>
      </li>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Knowledge - to see if the function can be/has been
      achieved in other ways</p>
      </li>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contradictions - if they exist they can be tackled</p>
      </li>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other tools - as/where appropriate.</p>
      </li>
      </i>
      </ol>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The study of the ‘system’ level of the passenger cabin is
interesting because the use of the various tools can be shown to produce similar
results, perhaps suggesting an indication of their validity. Below are some of
the potentially useful design directions identified</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trends</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beginning with a standard airline seat made of aluminium and
covered with foam blocks, a trend of increasing <i>dynamisation</i> is instantly
recognisable. </p>
<font SIZE="2">
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left">
<img border="0" src="06a.gif" width="400" height="61"></p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the current seat design has only developed insofar as
gaining a single joint in the form of a pivoting backrest, the scope for
improvement suggested by trends is considerable. A number of concepts around the
basis of improved dynamisation can be imagined, each with benefits over those
offered by existing designs:</p>
<dir>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A many jointed seat to better adapt to the passengers
      body</p>
      </li>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An ‘elastic’ mesh seat for greater comfort</p>
      </li>
  <li>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Liquid, gel or air-filled seats for ‘infinite’
      adaptability</p>
      </li>
</dir>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Investigating the opportunities presented by adding more
joints alone produces many interesting solutions (figure 3.1)</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left">
<img SRC="Image197.gif" width="591" height="187"></p>
</font>
<p align="left">Figure 3.1- chair dynamisation</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Knowledge</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The knowledge tool was applied by researching where the
desired function (“comfortable seating”) might have been delivered successfully
in another application. The notion of comfort is perhaps subjective, but by
considering office chairs, bean-bags and even bicycle saddles, <i>knowledge</i>
correlates exactly with what <i>trends</i> tells us about the dynamisation of
seats by utilising mesh, polystyrene balls and gels respectively. A mesh seat
has the added advantages that it is much less bulky than the conventional seat,
so providing more space for the passenger, and also that it will weigh less and
prevents the build up of moisture/heat.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These conclusions are similar to those of the British design
consultants Seymour-Powell[2], whose recent study of the airline seat produced a
lightweight mesh-based design (figure 3.2) which also incorporates a new
‘sliding’ reclination method whereby the knees of the passenger behind are less
affected.</p>

<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contradictions</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ was also used at the system level to optimise the
solutions suggested in the super-system analysis. An example of this is with the
‘sleeping capsules’ (figure 2.5). </p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It occurs that a uniform rectangular capsule is not ideal to
house a non-uniformly shaped passenger. Applying <i>asymmetry</i> to the
capsules in a similar manner to that used to solve the super-system
contradiction is useful (figure 3.3). N.B. The red arrow shows the point of
entry/exit to the capsule and is the end that accommodates the passenger’s head.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 3.3 - top view of adjacent cabins</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whereas it is not necessary for the leg-end to be wide, the
extra width provided at the head-end by doing this would greatly aid the feeling
of comfort and reduce the tendency for claustrophobia whilst also allowing
individual capsules to be more usefully tessellated within the fuselage.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hand luggage might be stored above the passenger’s legs
within a cabin of asymmetric shape (figure 3.4), but access to the luggage from
inside the limited cabin space is awkward. The contradiction is:</p>

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Conclusion</p>
    </blockquote>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The judgement of individual solutions is a long-winded
process that is in any case difficult without the use of appropriate models,
analysis and simulation. From an ideological perspective though, TRIZ can be
used to determine whether the ‘value’ of the system has been increased, where:
</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left">
<img SRC="Image202.gif" WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="56"></p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Success’ can therefore be defined as any worthwhile increase
in the value of the system, when either the benefits increase, or the ‘costs +
penalties’ decrease. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The majority of solutions suggested by TRIZ during the
investigation exhibited an increased value in this manner, and the reader is
invited to draw their own conclusions about the individual solutions presented.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In any case, it was shown that the aircraft cabin
super-system is highly optimised and problems emerge due to the limits on
absolute volume within the fuselage. The system, however, is less optimised and
various opportunities for advancing the technology using ideas suggested by TRIZ
are available. Problems here emerge largely because of problems adapting the
seat to the passenger’s body.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In simple terms, where TRIZ was required to solve problems
that were put to it, the solutions produced were reasonable, practical and
useful, and therefore it was thought that the application of TRIZ to economy
flight cabins was a justifiable exercise. </p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Constraints</p>
</b>
<p>This report has concentrated on the idea generation aspects of TRIZ rather
than the downstream ‘idea evaluation’ parts. During the evaluation elements of
the actual project, various social and legislative constraints (CAA/FAA
certification issues, etc) were brought to bear on the ideas developed earlier.
These constraints will inevitably have a bearing on any eventually practicable
solutions emerging from the work.</p>
<p>The work conducted deliberately sought to keep constraints out of the picture
until after the idea generation process was over. This was done in line with the
way our brains work - the act of ‘creation’ using a physically different part of
the brain to that used for ‘evaluation’[4]. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In purely ‘creative’ thinking mode, then, TRIZ assumes that
the system components have the freedom to be altered in any way necessary to
accomplish the solution (for example, re-orientation, separation, thermal
expansion etc.). Although acceptable for most simple mechanical systems, these
principles cannot always be applied to <i>humans</i>, and it was thus very
difficult to put aside the conditioning of many years of inherently building
these ergonomic considerations into the creative process. The simple answer to
this would be to build constraints into the TRIZ process <b>before</b> the idea
generation mode is entered, but this would in turn be fraught with difficulties
and hazards.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no obvious solution to this ‘constraint management’
process, and this is felt to be an area where TRIZ could be improved. It would
seem that this is the sort of area in which the ‘hard’, structured approach of
TRIZ would benefit from the incorporation of some of the findings of
psychology-based creativity research.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overall, for this project, ignoring the constraints was found
to be detrimental to the use of the contradictions tool, but, interestingly, was
found to be <i>essential</i> for the adequate operation of the ideal final
result tool. In fact, Virgin Atlantic have used a method similar to ideality
which they call ‘preferred futuring’[5].</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Formulation of Contradictions</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In certain circumstances it was found that ‘correctly’<i> </i>
formulating the contradiction for a problem such that a useful solution could be
obtained was difficult. Experience is clearly an advantage when formulating
contradictions in an explicit manner, and the guidance of someone with
considerable contradiction-formulating expertise was, at times, essential. It is
thought that relatively inexperienced problem owners attempting a similar
investigation without this level of support face a formidable challenge.
Additionally, the benefits of using TRIZ in pairs can be imagined. Experience
was also necessary where TRIZ knowledge is vague in deciding which tools to use.
An alternative approach is of course to use <i>all</i> of the tools available,
but this tends to dilute the consideration given to each method.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Flexible Shells and Thin Films’</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The TRIZ methodology is being continually revised as new
developments emerge. During the system analysis, a dynamisation trend proposed
that a seat using mesh to support the occupant would be an improvement.
Seymour-Powell also recognised this, and the advantages are clear: support is
improved, the seat occupies less space, moisture and heat build up are reduced,
etc. Flexible shells and thin films clearly offers a very effective solution
direction for the airline seat problem. However, the inventive principle was not
returned when any of the possible contradiction combinations that this solves -
<i>volume vs. adaptability</i>, <i>strength vs. weight, object generated harmful
factors vs. weight, etc -</i> is referred to in the matrix. The use of this
principle in solving the above contradiction suggests that there is a case for
updating the method accordingly - a worthwhile outcome from the investigation,
and something that concurs with previous analysis of how biological systems
solve similar problems[6].</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overall</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the most interesting conclusions, however, are shown
when comparisons between this research and other investigations are made. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The work of Seymour-Powell is the most relevant recent study
uncovered on the issue of economy seating in aircraft. They were asked by
Swissair management to somehow improve on-board comfort for their passengers,
and naturally set to on redesigning the seat. It is believed that by completely
ignoring the real cause of fundamental problems within the cabin, that of the
configuration and nature of the passenger seating, a classic case of inadequate
problem definition was experienced.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, at the system level many of the TRIZ tools do point
towards the type of chair that Seymour-Powell suggested. Whether this is
significant because Seymour-Powell were able to produce the solution without the
help of TRIZ or because a relatively inexperienced user has been able to derive
the same designs as two experienced design consultants is arguable. Both studies
do at least concur that this is how the state of the art should proceed.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This investigation may be notable as it acknowledges the fact
that the <i>configuration</i> of the seats is primarily to blame for the
discomfort of passengers and attempts to address this. The most important
concepts developed are therefore those from the super-system analysis. Indeed,
to the passenger with a choice of airlines, the factors affecting his/her
decision will increasingly be based around super-system features, i.e. legroom,
access to aisle, amount of seat recline, etc., as opposed necessarily to
features of the system.</p>
