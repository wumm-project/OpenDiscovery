<p>Abstract</p>
</b>
<p>These days, management decisions have to be made faster than
ever before but still be of high quality. Managers often have a lot of
information but with little structure and lack of time. Decisions still have to
be made NOW. Instead of really accept and handle the complexity of the problem
case managers quite often tend to simplify the problem - and then decide. Most
of the time managers won't follow a problem solving process. They decide purely
based on their intuition and business experience. Many other business areas such
as marketing, development, supply chain and production today use highly evolved
methodologies and data processing power. Why not the top management of the
company?</p>
<p>The TRIZ Technology with its unique thinking offers a
well-structured and high power problem solving process. The competence of fast
and optimized decision making in business and management can be achieved and
enhanced by using a TRIZ-based approach for non-technical problems.</p>
<b>
<p>1. TRIZ for Business and Management</p>
</b>
<p>Applying the TRIZ ‘thinking’ tools of inventive problem
solving in engineering successfully replaces the unsystematic trial-and-error
method in the search for solutions in the everyday life of engineers and
developers. The majority of organisational management decisions made by the
executives and managing directors however are still based on their intuition and
personal experience. Therefore often complex contexts are extremely simplified,
alternatives ignored, constraints avoided, risk not evaluated correctly and
resources, knowledge and potentials not utilised for the best problem solving at
the right time. </p>
<p>This is part of the reason for the growing demand from
management people for systematic and powerful thinking tools, which assist the
executives processing the information and making the right decisions in time.</p>
<p>The TRIZ Innovation Technology offers such thinking tools
(1-5). TRIZ knowledge and professional TRIZ application experience together with
TRIZ-based thinking for management tasks helped to identify the technology tools
which come into play:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
  <p>TRIZ tools, such as Innovation Principles for Business and
  Management as well as Separation Principles for resolving organisational
  contradictions and conflicts, for example. </li>
  <li>
  <p>Substance-Field Analysis for visualizing highly complex
  systems.</li>
  <li>
  <p>Procedures and checklists of the anticipatory failure
  recognition for prediction and evaluation of risks. </li>
  <li>
  <p>Operators for revealing and utilising system resources as a
  basis for effective and cost-saving decisions.</li>
  <li>
  <p>Patterns of evolution of technical systems to support
  systematic and multi-dimensional thinking. </li>
</ul>
  <b>
</b>
<p>Today commercial TRIZ-tools for electronic data processing
allows to build a specific idea and data base including own case processing (6).</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Components of the demanded management thinking structure
</p>
</b>
<p>If agreement is obtained that management decisions should be
based on more methodology, the TRIZ knowledge base along with its analytic
methods can effectively be used. TRIZ for business and management basically use
these five components:</p>
<p></p>
<b>
<p>2.1. Identification and theoretical exaggeration of conflicts</p>
</b>
<p>Non-technical conflicts such as organisational or
administrative contradictions and conflicts on different levels (personnel,
team, company area, entire company, branch of industry etc.) should be
identified, theoretically exaggerated and then resolved in the next stages. The
desired result is to substantially decrease or even eliminate all unwanted
tendencies and features, while at the same time keeping and intensifying all
positive and useful factors. </p>
<p></p>
<b>
<p>2.2. A positive attitude towards complexity </p>
</b>
<p>Instead of simplifying complex combinations and interactions
when analysing a task, the TRIZ method allows even highly complex and
multi-dimensional interconnections to be clearly explained. The complexity of a
task itself becomes the prerequisite to finding the best solution.</p>
<p></p>
<b>
<p>2.3. Consideration of patterns of evolution</p>
</b>
<p>The hierarchic (systematic) consideration and evolutionary
development of the conflicting entities and factors play an important role in
the analysis and evaluation of possible decisions. Further TRIZ evolutionary
criteria such as adaptability, controllability and periodic occurrences complete
the systematic approach to the problem.</p>
<p></p>
<b>
<p>2.4. Anticipatory evaluation of risks</p>
</b>
<p>Decisions and strategies are tested by the method of the
Anticipatory Failure Identification. The strength of this method is to find
weaknesses within the proposed management solution by systematically trying to
“prove them wrong”. All available resources are utilised deliberately to cause
the concept failure. Hidden risks of a decision are effectively revealed and can
be avoided in further steps. </p>
<p></p>
<b>
<p>2.5. Utilisation and expansion of resources and knowledge</p>
</b>
<p>The central function of knowledge and idea management is to
utilise the personal and collective knowledge in time, to broaden the boundaries
of knowledge and to provide timesaving access to knowledge and idea pools. The
TRIZ Idea database with its many thousands of effects and examples offers a
solid knowledge basis.</p>
<p></p>
<b>
<p>3. The process for problem solving in business and management</p>
</b>
<p>For the first step a non-technical problem should be
formulated in terms of a conflict or contradiction with positive and negative
aspects similar to the technical contradiction. This conflict can then be
strengthened in terms of deepened physical contradiction. By using the 12 double
innovation principles or the separation principles for the deepened conflicts
the problem can be overcome. </p>
<p>The amount of generated ideals is considerably faster and
higher compared with the solutions managers usually come up with. Especially for
critical cases a problem solving process with the following main phases is
suggested: Function and Conflict Analysis, Mobilisation of Resources, Generating
of Ideas, Evaluating of the Results and Anticipatory Risk Analysis.</p>

<p>4. 12 innovation principles for business and management</p>
</b>
<p>The 12 double principles for Business and Management, partly
derived from (1,2), assist the user resolving organisational contradictions and
conflicts. They broaden the individual experiences and intuition of the manager
and in addition help them to quickly formulate several different approaches to
difficult situations.</p>
<p>Each principle represents two contradictory lines of action,
which have to be taken into consideration when searching for solutions. There is
no recommendation as to which action is the more suitable. The user is thus
stimulated to think in a dialectic and creative way. </p>

<b>
<p>5. Example</p>
</b>
<p></p>
<p>In companies quite often problems arise due to difficulties
in communication. As an example the communication lack between a highly
technically competent and thus important individual and the rest of the staff
can be used. The resulting personal conflicts then have a negative effect upon
the productivity and the working climate. Here are some suggestions using the
principles as to how to defuse the problem:</p>
<p>Principle 1. Combination - Separation:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>“Isolate” the person for the staff to avoid direct
  contact and organize a central counsellor. </li>
  <li>Arrange for the “difficult” person to work at home
  or to have flexitime.</li>
  <li>Set up a database or an Expert System to make the
  expertise of the person available to others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Principle 2. Symmetry - Asymmetry:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Reduce asymmetry in company expertise; internally
  train or hire several experts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Principle 3. Homogeneity - Diversity:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Encourage psychological homogeneity and raise the
  tolerance threshold of the colleagues. </li>
</ul>
<p>Principle 4. Expansion - Reduction</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Reduce the individual’s direct involvement with
  colleagues and in projects. </li>
</ul>
<p>Principle 5. Mobility - Immovability:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>educe the individual’s sphere of movement within
  the company through organizational means. </li>
</ul>
<p>Principle 7. Standardisation - Specialisation:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Standardise company knowledge and working methods.
  Introduce knowledge management.</li>
  <li>Use the unique (or specialist) knowledge of the individual to build up the
  knowledge management system or have them organise this task.</li>
</ul>
<p>Principle 8. Action - Reaction:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Arrange a social and psychological guidance
  program for the individual. </li>
</ul>
<p>Principle 9. Continuous action - Interrupted action:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Only involve the individual in a consultative role
  and in certain phases of a project. </li>
</ul>
<p>Principle 10. Partial action - Excessive action:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Reduce the amount of time that the individual
  spends in projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Principle 11. Direct action - Indirect action:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Provide a mediator or a social buffer for the
  individual in the team or in the company. </li>
</ul>
