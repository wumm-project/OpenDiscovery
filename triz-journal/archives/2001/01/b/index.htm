<p>Preface:</p>
</u></b>
<p>The following paper summarizes a real industrial problem solving experience
that was part of a graduate-level course. The course focused on an in-depth
study of the fundamental principles of the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving.
Each student selected a real problem to solve using the methods as part of the
class. The algorithm, ARIZ - 85C, was used to guide the student systematically
through the problem solving process. The following paper describes one student's
experience applying TRIZ methods.</p>
<b><u>
<p>Introduction:</p>
</u></b>
<p>The topic for this paper involves a textile coating process known as
kiss-coating. This process is currently being used where I work as a textile
chemist. A water based adhesive, which is an emulsion, is fed into a trough
until the trough is 75% full. Inside the trough an engraved gravure print roll
turns. As the roll turns the engraved cells on the surface of the print roll
fill with the coating mixture in the trough. A doctor blade cleans off excess
coating that is on the printing roll and this excess coating mix is returned to
the trough for reuse. Once the print roll is clear of excess coating mix, it
then meets a rubber roll that is under downward pressure. The fabric passes in
between the two rolls. As the fabric gets nipped between the print roll and the
rubber roll, a slight vacuum is created and the coating mix leaves the cells on
the print roll and transfer to the surface of the fabric. This particular
coating process is used to obtain a surface coating rather than saturating the
fabric with coating. The wet-coated fabric then wraps around heated drying cans
to drive off the water on the coated fabric and leave behind the adhesive
coating.</p>
<b><u>
<p>The Engineering Problem to be solved:</p>
</u></b>
<p>As in many operations, the line speed dictates the cost of a product. The
faster a product is made the higher the production rate (units made per hours or
shift) and therefore its cheaper to manufacture the product. The money saved by
running at higher production rates turns into company profits or is sometimes
passed onto the customer in an effort to remain competitive in the textile
industry. The higher product rates also allow for an increase in machine
production capacity, which is needed by most growing companies.</p>
<p>It was discovered in this operation in question that as the speed of the
machine was increased, the coating weight decreased. This forced the product to
be run through a two-pass operation or at a slower speed so that the desired
coating weight could be achieved. The slower coating operation caused the
production rate to go down and the faster two-pass operation had the same effect
on the production rate.</p>
<p>What is needed is a method that allows for an increased production rate
(faster coating speed) and at the same time provides a sufficient coating
weight. ARIZ-85C will be used to solve this problem.</p>
<b><u>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initial concept solutions generated before applying TRIZ methodology:</p>
</u></b>
<p>Some of the initial ideas that were generated to solve this problem are as
follows:</p>
<b>
</p><ol>
  <li>Changing the cell size on the print roll.</li>
</ol>
</b>
</p><ul>
  <li>The idea behind this was to use a larger cell to hold more coating mixture
    in hopes of getting more of the coating mixture on the fabric. The cell size
    was changed to a larger size but the problem still existed.</li>
</ul>
<b>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Change the viscosity of the coating mixture.</li>
</ol>
</b>
</p><ul>
  <li>It was thought that if the viscosity of the mixture was decreased, it
    might move more easily out of the cells and onto the fabric. Problems
    experienced with this idea is that as the viscosity decreases via diluting
    with water, the percent solids in the mixture decrease. This means that
    although it may be possible to pick-up more coating mixture, there will be
    fewer solids picked up and therefore still a decrease in coating weight.</li>
</ul>

</b>
<p>Utilization of the Matrix Table reveals the following principles used most to
solve the contradiction stated: 11, 35, 27, and 28</p>
<b><u>
<p>Principle 11 - Cushion in Advance</u>: </b>Compensate for the relatively low
reliability of an object by countermeasures taken in advance.</p>
<b>
<p>Possible solutions generated from principle:</p>
</b>
</p><ul>
  <li>Since the coating weight decreases with coating speed. There may be an
    opportunity to chemically treat the fabric during the finishing process
    (before the coating process in question) with an additional chemical that
    may improve the wet-out properties of the fabric. This would allow the
    fabric to absorb the coating faster, which would let the fabric pick-up more
    coating during the increased speed.</li>
  <li>There also may be an additional chemical that may be added to coating mix
    that goes onto the fabric during the coating process that would assist in
    coating mix transfer to the moving fabric.</li>
  <li>These solutions would “cushion” the fabric or coating mix in advance
    before the coating process in question.</li>
</ul>
<b><u>
<p>Principle 35 - Transformation of physical and chemical states of an object:</p>
</u></b>
<blockquote>
  <p>Change the aggregate state of an object, the concentration of density, the
  degree of flexibility or the temperature.</p>
  <b>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Possible solutions generated from the principle:</p>
</b>
</p><ul>
  <li>Change of the chemical states of the fabric or coating mix are mentioned
    in possible solutions generated from principle 11 (stated above).</li>
  <li>The fabric is currently a blend of 50% cotton and 50% polyester. The
    fabric could be changed to 100% cotton, which has inherent abilities to
    absorb the coating mix through its wicking properties. The polyester fiber
    in the current fabric does not have high absorbent properties as cotton.
    However, it should be noted that this would drastically change the final
    product and affect both the physical properties of the coated fabric
    (tensile strength, elongation properties and hand) and the cost of the base
    fabric (100% cotton fabric is more expensive than a 50/50 blend of
    cotton/polyester).</li>
  <li>Before the fabric is coated, heat may be applied to pre-heat the fabric,
    which may help in picking-up the coating mix during the coating process.
    This may help dry out the fabric and help in absorbing the coating mix.</li>
  <li>The viscosity of the coating mix (2,500 cps) can be lowered to
    approximately 1,000 cps by heating the coating mix. This would assist in the
    flow properties on the coating mix and may allow the coating mix to move
    easily from the coating assembly to the fabric.</li>
</ul>
<b><u>
<p>Principle 27 - An inexpensive short-life object instead of an expensive
durable one:</p>
<blockquote>
</u></b>
<p>Replace an expensive object by a collection of inexpensive ones, compromising
other properties (longevity, for instance). This improves the existing system
but does not directly address the problem at hand.</p>
<b>
</blockquote>
<p>Possible solutions generated from principle:</p>
</b>
</p><ul>
  <li>A patent review of similar processes revealed that a relatively expensive
    object in the coating assembly, the steel doctor blade, should be replaced
    with a cheap plastic blade. It was discovered that the plastic blade is more
    reliable and allows for better coating weight control.</li>
</ul>
<b><u>
<p>Principle 28 - Replacement of a mechanical system:</p>
</u></b>
<blockquote>
  <p>Replace a mechanical system by an optical, acoustical or odor system.
  Replace fields.</p>
  <b>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Possible solutions generated from principle:</p>
</b>
</p><ul>
  <li>The current nip roll, which lies and applies pressure onto the fabric and
    print roll is made of solid steel, which has a coating of hard rubber.
    Because the rubber is relatively hard, there is no give in the rubber when
    it makes contact with the print roll. This makes the contact area between
    the rubber roll and print roll small. If a softer rubber roll with more give
    is used, the contact area will increase when pressure is applied. This would
    increase the dwell time of the fabric to pick up the coating. This
    mechanical pressure from the rubber roll could also be replaced with a
    pneumatic roll where you can increase the hardness of the roll by inflating
    or deflating the hollow roll.</li>

    maximum effect is required.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="07.gif" width="513" height="103"></p>
<p>The selective maximum effect that is required for IC-2 is slow coating speed
and should be maximum to produce the high production rate but at a minimum when
coating the fabric so that a good coating weight can be obtained. The minimal
field is the slow coating speed effect.</p>
<p>This promotes an idea that you get an effect at the coating assembly that
prints as though the coating process is slow but the added substance still
provides a high production rate. This is the same type of idea generated in the
SU-Field model for IC-1. A connection can be made where the system move fast but
coat the fabric as if it is moving slow.</p>
<p><b>Physical Contradiction Theory:</b></p>
<p>At this stage in the algorithm, I can see how this engineering problem can
also be stated as a Physical Contradiction.</p>
<p><b>Physical Contradiction: </b>The process must be both fast and slow at the
same time.</p>
<p><b>Separation Within a Whole Object and Its Parts: </b>I believe that the
solution for this Physical Contradiction would be found using the Separation
Within a Whole Object and Its Parts principle. The fabric must pass through the
production line at a high speed to achieve the high production rate but when the
fabric gets coated, it must run through a slower process to achieve a good
coating weight. The coating process could be looked at very closely at the slow
speed and may somehow be duplicated at the fast speed. It sounds as though the
time may play an important factor in solving this problem.</p>

<p>The coating assembly is filled with coating mix and the gravure print roll is
turned on. As the gravure roll turns, the cells within the print roll collect
the coating mixture that is located within the trough. The doctor blade then
wipes excess coating from the surface of the roll leaving the coating that is
within the cells. The fabric then passes over then print roll as the rubber roll
is brought down via air pressure pistons. As the fabric is pressed between the
rubber roll and the print roll with its cells filled with coating mixture a
slight vacuum is created by squeezing the fabric. The fabric is then released
from the pressure and the vacuum promotes the coating within the print cells of
the gravure roll to be transferred onto the surface of the fabric. The fabric
then leaves the coating assembly for drying. The system is in a continuous
process and repeats itself without interruption.</p>

<p>6.6. Draw the relative picture of events going on in the OZs during OT using
the Smart Little Persons Model:</p>
</b><b><u>
<p align="left">Using Smart Many Little People Modeling (MLP Modeling):</p>
</u>
<p>The Zone of Conflict:</p>
</b>
<p>The Zone of Conflict occurs only when the coating speed is increased. This
takes form in that the fabric does not pick-up enough coating from the coating
assembly at the increased speed.</p>
<b>
<p>MLP Model Utilization:</p>
</b>
<p>MLP is found to be extremely useful in this problem. The model can be
depicted below as the MLP being on fabric whose job is to grasp the MLP on the
print roll in the form of the coating mix in the print cells filled with MLP
looking to leave the print roll and grasp the MLP on the fabric. This would
transfer the coating MLP to the fabric MLP.</p>
<p><b>Initial Model:</b> The fabric people represent sites where the coating
people can attach themselves to by letting the fabric people pull the coating
people out of there cells.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="11.gif" width="544" height="156"></p>
<p>At a slow coating speed, the fabric people have enough time to grasp the
coating people as can be seen in the following model:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="12.gif" width="543" height="153"></p>
<b>
<p>The “Was” Model:</b> In the “was” model, the coating speed has been
increased and the fabric people cannot grasp all the coating people. Therefore
some of the coating people are left inside their cells as displayed in the
following picture:</p>
<b>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="13.gif" width="542" height="154"></p>
<p>The “Should Be” Model:</b> This model should be the same as when the
coating speed is lowered but we are coating at a faster coating speed:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="14.gif" width="540" height="153"></p>
<b>
<p>Technical Solutions for the MLP Model:</p>
<p>Solution 1:</b> The current scenario is that that fabric is moving too fast
for the fabric people to grasp onto the coating people. This implies that there
is a time constraint present due to the increase in coating speed. This
constraint was not present when the coating speed was reduced because the
coating on the fabric was not reduced. The solution to get to the “should be”
model at a fast coating speed is to increase the time that the fabric people and
coating people have together so that the fabric people will have time to grasp
onto the coating people. Since the coating speed cannot be lowered to allow for
this, it must me accomplished in another way.</p>
<p>The MLP modeling allows for a closer look at the situation. The contact time
that the MLP have with each other can be determined by measuring the contact
area between the rubber roll and the print roll (at the nip point). It is this
contact area that must be increased to make up for the decrease in time lost
when the coating speed was increased. The contact time and area are also known
in the field as dwell time. So the dwell time between the two sets of MLP must
me increased so that coating transfer can occur.</p>
<p>A softer rubber roll will increase this dwell time between the MLP and should
allow for the coating MLP to be grasped by the fabric MLP. The softer rubber
will provide for contact area when in contact (under pressure) with the gravure
print roll.</p>
<b>
<p>Solution 2:</b> The fabric MLP people could be enhanced to become better able
to grasp the coating MLP when passing by at a fast speed. Adding a re-wetting
agent to the fabric prior to the coating operation may do this. This re-wetting
chemical agent would give the fabric additional wet-out properties that may
increase the fabric’s MLPs to grasp the coating MLP.</p>
<b>
<p>Solution 3:</b> Lowering the coating mix viscosity will help the coating MLP
to move more freely from there cells. This may help the fabric MLP to pull the
coating MLP from the cells more effectively even though the dwell time that they
have would still be decreased. It should be noted however that if the viscosity
is reduced, the % solids in the coating mix should not be lowered because it
will add to lowering the final coating weight.</p>
<b><u>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
</u></b>
<p>The input from the Technical Contradiction Matrix Theory, SU-Field Analysis,
Physical Contradiction Theory, and MLP modeling has solved the engineering
contradiction presented in the introduction to this paper. I do not feel that
completing sections 7 through 11 of ARIZ-85C is necessary. I have had the
opportunity to apply what I have learned using ARIZ-85C with real problem. I am
glad to say that I have been able to apply Solution 1 from the MLP modeling in a
real life situation where I work. It should also be noted that Solution 1 from
MLP modeling also ties into the Technical Contradiction Matrix Theory, SU-Field
Analysis, and Physical Contradiction Theory. The outputs from these tools have
let to the idea of compensating for the increase in coating speed by matching
the coating dwell time that was achieved at the slow coating speed.</p>
<p>Although I do not think that this solution is a very innovative solution, it
was a real problem that was solved using TRIZ tools. The tools provided a method
to see through the physiological inertia that was actually present in my work
environment.</p>
<p>As stated before, this problem initially started off as an administrative
problem in that the coating line was running at 30 yds./min. and there was
little understanding as to why the coating weight was so low. It was known that
the coating weight must be increased and the speed was not thought to play a
role. I did not have much experience on the production line or this particular
coating process. I was able to provide an outside view of what may be happening.
This outside view also allowed me to be free of much of the psychological
inertia that others had by working on the problem. I also owed a great deal to
what this class has taught me.</p>
<p>I proposed that a study of line speed versus coating weight be performed
because it was the easiest variable that we had control over. The results can be
found below in Figure 3 below.</p>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<p align="left"><font size="2"><a href="15.gif" target="_blank"><img src="15_small.gif" border="1" width="100" height="104"></a></font></p>
</font>
<p>From the results of this study, it became clear what the real problem was. It
was a technical contradiction in that when the line speed was increased, the
coating weight decreased. I therefore decided that I would use this as my major
project for TE 589A.</p>
<p>I applied Solution 1 from the MLP modeling found in Section 6.6 by replacing
the 90 hardness (Shore A) rubber roll with a 60 hardness (Shore A) softer rubber
roll. We were looking for a total coating weight of approximately 2.50 oz./yd<sup>2</sup>.
Our results before the rubber roll change were around 2.35 oz./yd<sup>2</sup> at
30 yds./min., which can be seen on Figure 3. The softer rubber roll idea from
Solution 1 results can be seen in Figure 4.</p>
<sup><sub><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<p align="left"><font size="2"><a href="16.gif" target="_blank"><img src="16_small.gif" border="1" width="100" height="104"></a></font></p>
</font></sub></sup>
<p>A large increase in coating weight was achieved by using the softer rubber
roll and MLP Solution 1 provided a means where the coating speed could be
increased and the coating increased within specifications. The Engineering
Technical Contradiction was resolved.</p>
<p>This problem is probably a level 2 for solution inventiveness, which is why
the full completion on ARIZ may have been too much since ARIZ is usually used to
solve hard (possibly level 4 or 5) inventive problems. However, as a new
practitioner of TRIZ methods, ARIZ systematically guided me through the problem
solving process.</p>
<p>Even though my primary academic training is Textile Chemistry, following the
systematic approach to apply TRIZ methods enabled me to identify a mechanical
solution that solved my problem. Although the solution may have been one
identified by a mechanical engineer, I was able to &quot;look&quot; in a new
direction for solutions.</p>
<p>TRIZ methods and practices I have learned in this class have changed the way
I tackle problems in my everyday work related situations. I will continue to use
this method whenever possible.</p>

  <li><b>Has TRIZ changed the way you perceive a problem?<br>
    <br>
    </b><i>Absolutely.<br>
    </i><b><br>
    </b>If yes, how? If no, why?<br>
    <br>
    <i>I work in an environment where people end up doing what we call “fire-fighting”.
    This is when a problem comes up during production, people scurry to solve
    the problem. The solution usually ends up being “band-aide” and does not
    get to the root of the problem. In fact, the real problem is usually not
    really understood and the problem resurfaces in a short time.<br>
    <br>
    I received my BS in textile chemistry and I worked within this
    textile-manufacturing environment for 2 years as a manger of product
    development and a member of the technical support team. Needless to say,
    without much prior experience this form of problem solving became a part of
    me. After all, my superiors all treated problem solving this way.<br>
    <br>
    This course taught me to understand and well define what the real problems
    are and that one does not have to accept an engineering trade-off as a
    solution.<br>
    <br>
    </i></li>
  <li><b>Has TRIZ increased your ability to solve problems?<br>
    <br>
    </b><i>Yes.<br>
    </i><br>
    If yes, how? If no, why?<br>
    <br>
    <i>I now approach work related problems with confidence and the ability to
    solve them using TRIZ. I now realize that no problem is unsolvable. I can
    identify when I am being affected by my prior experience or in-experience
    (psychological inertia) and see through self-imposed barriers (such as “it
    can’t be done or we’ve tried that already”) to solve problems.<br>

  <li><b>Please quantify and describe any increase in solution quality?<br>
    <br>
    </b><i>I believe that I have improved my solution quality by 95%.<br>
    </i><br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Please quantify any increase in the Level of Innovativeness associated
    with your solutions?<br>
    <br>
    </b>1 level:<br>
    2 levels: <i>Not sure of the exact meaning question but the number of the
    solutions that I am now able to generate using TRIZ has increased. I no
    longer come up with only one possible solution but now have several possible
    solutions.<br>
    <br>
    </i></li>
  <li><b>Will you continue to use TRIZ? Why or why not.<br>
    </b><br>
    <i>I will continue to use TRIZ at work because it is extremely helpful in
    solving problems and provides an algorithm to problem solving and helps to
    scientifically direct you toward an inventive solution.<br>
    </i><br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Will you teach TRIZ to co-workers? Why or why not.<br>
    <br>
    </b><i>I will teach TRIZ to my co-workers because it is so effective. They
    have already heard my praises for the theory. I was able to solve an actual
    work related problem in the course’s final major project for TE 589A that
    the company has been working on by using the trial and error methodology. I
    explained several of the TRIZ methods I used in my solution such as the
    Contradiction Matrix and Modeling with Many Little People and generated a
    lot of interest for the theory.<br>
    </i><br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Will you use TRIZ software?<br>
    <br>
    </b><i>Through NC State’s distance learning program (Textile Off-campus
    Textile Education), I did not have the opportunity to see or try any TRIZ
    software. I have been to the Ideation website and have read reviews on what
    the software provides. It sounds interesting and will look into the software
    and I become more experienced with TRIZ tools.<br>
    </i><br>
  </li>
  <li><b>How useful did you find the TRIZ Journal (www.triz-journal.com)?<br>
    <br>
    </b><i>I found the TRIZ Journal extremely useful and have become a member of
    the free monthly subscription newsletter. I would suggest all students visit
    the web site often to read the monthly articles and become a member to learn
    about when the latest papers are published.<br>
    <br>
    The journal articles also provided insight into some TRIZ tools that I had
    some questions about and clarified many issues.<br>
    </i><br>
  </li>
  <li><b>What portions of the class helped the most to reinforce learning?<br>
    <br>
    </b><i>I would definitely say that the homework problems provided the
    greatest reinforcement because I feel I would not have really had a firm
    grasp of the subject without applying the TRIZ tools in homework problems.
    The major project of applying ARIZ to a problem was also very helpful in
    watching all the TRIZ tools work together and leads to possible solutions.<br>
    </i><br>
  </li>
  <li><b>What portions of the class helped the least to reinforce learning?<br>
    <br>

  <li><b>What roadblock, if any, do you think would prohibit the wide-spread

    </i></b><i>I think the main roadblock would be from people in industry that
    are close-minded and are not willing to accept that an algorithm can be used
    to solve problems. I feel that some people would feel threatened that
    industry experience is not the only quality needed to solve problems. The
    sooner people are introduced to TRIZ, the more willing they may be to accept
    and use TRIZ.<br>
    <br>
    I initially think that it would be considered more valuable to
    students/professionals that have experience in industry dealing with
    problems. Students that have not had much experience in industry may not
    realize just how valuable learning TRIZ tools are. This course is a must for
    all people and I highly recommend it. Even if you do not realize it now
    because of lack of work experience, learning to apply TRIZ will make you
    more valuable to employers.</i></li>
