<p>Introduction</p>
</b></font>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, attempts to apply TRIZ to management and
administration problems were entertained on occasion by several TRIZ
specialists, primarily for the purpose of enhancing various manufacturing
processes. Efforts in this area were limited, however, because in the communist
Soviet Union, the privilege of making business decisions belonged to people who
had no interest in TRIZ. Moreover, there was no chance whatsoever of launching a
private business. The situation changed dramatically with the onset of the
Russian “acceleration of technical progress” (the so-called <i>pre-perestroika</i>)
and then <i>perestroika; </i>together these programs served to stimulate the use
of TRIZ in technological areas. But within a few years the deteriorating
economic situation had driven most industries into a deep crisis, virtually
eliminating any chance of making a living by solving technical problems. Yet at
the same time these conditions gave rise to new opportunities for quickly
accumulating successful experiences in working with new commercial (mostly
trade) organizations in the areas of business, management, politics,
advertising, etc.</p>
<p>When we established Ideation International in 1992, we knew that the highest
return on our investment (in terms of time and money) would be achieved by
applying TRIZ to business and management rather than technology. But we
restricted ourselves to technology because the notion that Russians could teach
Americans anything about business sounded absurd. We therefore decided to
introduce TRIZ in its “traditional” arena first to prove that a science
capable of solving technical problems in a structured, systematic way did in
fact exist. Then, when the time was right and TRIZ had established a solid
reputation, we would move into the areas of management, business, education,
etc.</p>
<p>Today, with TRIZ known in more than 25 countries, taught in 35 universities
around the world, and with hundreds of TRIZ sites on the Internet, we believe
that finally the time is right.</p>
<p>For over four decades, non-technical applications were not the primary focus
of TRIZ. Nonetheless, a great deal of research was conducted and many papers
written (the majority of which remain untranslated) on these applications. This
paper represents an attempt to share the wealth of information, research
findings, and experiences that have been gained over the last 25 years in
applying TRIZ to non-technical areas. We have documented numerous facts and
events based on available sources (books, papers, manuscripts, correspondence,
etc.) and on the recollections of the TRIZ scientists involved. For obvious
reasons, we cannot claim that our review is an exhaustive one, but we believe it
is fairly comprehensive as it is based on the following:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>From 1974 to 1993, the authors participated in every important TRIZ event
    and collaborated extensively with Genrich Altshuller (and thus were familiar
    with the leading TRIZ research)</li>
  <li>Our personal libraries and archives include:
    </p><ul>
      <li>Six large volumes of personal correspondence with Altshuller,
        containing numerous discussions related to the most vital TRIZ issues</li>
      <li>Nearly all published TRIZ work, numerous manuscripts on various TRIZ
        subjects, abstracts from TRIZ seminars and workshops, educational
        materials, and extensive personal notes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Because we have so greatly enjoyed being part of a community dedicated to
    carrying out the TRIZ mission, the past years are unforgettable. We
    therefore cherish - and rely on - our memories.</li>

<p>Chapter 1. Historical review and the theoretical foundation for expanding
TRIZ into non-technical areas</p>
<p>Why TRIZ is applicable in non-technical areas</p>
</font></b>
<p>It is well known that Genrich Altshuller began developing TRIZ as a pure
engineering science, based on the statistical research of patents and other
sources of technical information. The goal of his research was to reveal the “patterns
of innovation” so that they could be exploited for the purpose of advancing
technological systems. Ultimately, Altshuller established a procedure for
developing a methodology for creative problem solving, as follows:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Accumulate a data bank of numerous creative solutions (inventions, for the
    technological arena)</li>
  <li>Identify different “levels” of creative solutions, then select the
    high-level solutions from the data bank</li>
  <li>Reveal typical patterns by which creative solutions of different levels
    are obtained (innovation principles, patterns of evolution, etc.)<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>Develop algorithms for obtaining these solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Since then, the following additional steps have been formulated:</p>
<p>In the area of problem solving:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Reveal the typical problems found in the targeted area</li>
  <li>Collect powerful solutions and create a corresponding data bank</li>
  <li>Perform multiple test cycles of the obtained algorithms on numerous
    educational problems (case studies). Tests should be performed first by the
    author, then by his/her colleagues, and finally by TRIZ students at seminars
    and workshops</li>
  <li>Introduce appropriate corrections as a result of testing</li>
</ul>
<p>In the area of “patterns of evolution”:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Clearly define the boundaries of validity for each pattern (for example, a
    pattern might apply to mechanical systems only)</li>
  <li>Coordinate and structure the various patterns into a hierarchical system
    (pattern/line/principle/sub-principle, etc.)</li>
  <li>Test the applicability of the patterns in other areas of technology;
    clarify and reformulate as necessary to address the additional areas without
    lessening their reliability or potency</li>
</ul>
<p>The above procedure, though not published in this format by Altshuller, was
for the most part repeatedly addressed by him in numerous seminars and
discussions; these steps are also readily seen in his work. Even more
significant, however, is that this approach has been applied numerous times in
the technological realm - and with great success.</p>
<p>During the early stages in the development of TRIZ, examples of successful
attempts to apply selected TRIZ tools and approaches to non-technical areas
started to accumulate. TRIZ educators began, in a systematic manner, to address
their students’ attempts to apply knowledge gained from TRIZ to various
problems, in particular<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Problems from subjects they studied in schools and colleges</li>
  <li>Various “everyday life” problems</li>
  <li>Conflicts in family life and in the working environment</li>
  <li>Problems in art, sports, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the early 1980s, a substantial number of successful TRIZ applications in
non-technical areas had been achieved. Several papers were written describing
attempts to find similarities in different areas (for example, demonstrating the
parallels between contradictions in technology and in the evolution of science)<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>.
However, Altshuller repeatedly warned against such hasty “reassignments,”
insisting that the same procedure (especially the first four steps) that he had
established for the development of TRIZ be followed.</p>
<p>One of the most serious problems was associated with the first step, that is,
<i>accumulating creative solutions in the given area.</i> Altshuller was
fortunate in starting with technology as it was the only area with a
well-documented and comprehensive source of solutions (the patent library).
Collecting creative solutions in other areas with sufficient completeness would
likely have taken decades given the human and financial resources available at
the time.</p>
<p>Between 1982 and 1984 Boris Zlotin and Alla Zusman, who were investigating
the possibilities for expanding TRIZ, analyzed the existing cases where TRIZ
tools were applied to non-technical problems. As described in our previous
publications, TRIZ offers two types of tools<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Analytical tools that help to define, formulate and model a problem; these
    include ARIZ and Substance-Field Analysis (which were later complemented by
    the Innovation Situation Questionnaire and Problem Formulator)</li>
  <li>Knowledge-base tools that provide recommendations for system
    transformation (40 Innovation Principles, 76 Standard Solutions, collections
    of physical, chemical and geometrical effects, System of Operators, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, TRIZ included several so-called “psychological operators”<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>
that facilitated the creative process.</p>
<p>Zlotin and Zusman’s analysis resulted in the following conclusions:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>The commonalties in the evolution of various technological systems, as
    discovered by Altshuller, can be further expanded into various non-technical
    areas. For example, basic TRIZ concepts such as ideality, contradictions and
    the systems approach are fully applicable to non-technical problems and
    situations. Eventually, these considerations led to a definition of
    Universal Patterns of Evolution<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup></li>
  <li>Analytical tools and psychological operators are directly applicable or
    can be easily modified to accommodate non-technical applications.</li>
  <li>Although existing knowledge-base tools were, in general, derived from
    technical information, the process of abstraction and generalization<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>
    rendered some innovation principles universal (examples are <i>inversion</i>,
    <i>segmentation</i>, <i>convert a harm into benefit</i>, <i>dynamization</i>,
    <i>self-service</i>, etc.). Others have proven useful when imaginatively
    applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the basis of the above conclusions, the following approach was developed
to address problem solving and system evolution in non-technical areas:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Transfer TRIZ patterns, problem-solving tools and algorithms into
    non-technical areas, identifying their applicability and adapting them to
    the new area</li>
  <li>Transfer patterns from other areas (biology, sociology, psychology, etc.)
    into TRIZ; identifying their applicability and adapting them to TRIZ.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach substantially accelerated the expansion of TRIZ and provided a
common basis for problem solving in the following areas.</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Development of a system of universal and general patterns of evolution</li>
  <li>Solving scientific problems</li>
  <li>Development of methods having to do with safety</li>
  <li>Development of the theory of evolution of organizations, as well as TRIZ
    applications for solving business, management and social problems</li>
  <li>Computerization of TRIZ and the development of TRIZSoft<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup></li>
  <li>Development of the Directed Evolution application<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup></li>
  <li>Children’s education</li>
</ul>

<p>Enhancing the creative imagination, and TRIZ in the arts</p>
</font></b>
<p>It is significant that for most of his life, Altshuller did not capitalize on
his work with TRIZ, nor was TRIZ supported by the Soviet government or academia<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup>.
From the mid-1950s, Altshuller’s main source of income was writing science
fiction<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>. Working in parallel on TRIZ and science
fiction stories, Altshuller (not surprisingly) applied his TRIZ discoveries to
the area of science fiction. Following the approach he had developed of amassing
a library of solutions, he began collecting and updating a library of science
fiction ideas, which eventually contained descriptions of approximately 20,000
science fiction situations. Similar to his Levels of Innovation, Altshuller
created a system of classification for this library as well. He also studies the
writings of several famous science fiction writers (H. G. Wells, Jules Verne,
etc.) and proved that their fantasies had a higher percentage of realization
than professional futurists.</p>
<p>As a result of these parallel efforts, Altshuller came to understand that
reading, discussing and creating fantastic ideas is very useful in helping
inventors increase their creative imagination. Based on the library of science
fiction ideas, Altshuller developed several methods of enhancing creative
imagination, along with a set of training exercises. These methods and
exercises, together with the book <i>Science Fiction for Engineers and Inventors</i>
(written by Altshuller’s student and colleague Pavel Amnuel) were distributed
among leading TRIZ schools and specialists in the early 1970s between, and
became the foundation for a course in Creative Imagination Enhancement (CIE).</p>
<p>Besides the study of methods based on science fiction, a typical CIE course
contained special training for reducing psychological inertia (including Smart
Little Creatures Modeling and Dimension-Time-Cost operators), and the systems
approach (multi-screen creative thinking). These courses also entailed the study
of famous artists<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>, writers and others.</p>
<p>In 1975-6, St. Petersburg TRIZ University<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup>
offered the first CIE course for inventors. Besides material developed and
recommended by Altshuller, this course contained a broader use of psychological
approaches as well as new exercises and case studies. The first course was
taught by Boris Zlotin<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup>; the following year, one
of Zlotin’s top students, Simon Litvin, began teaching the course. Together,
Zlotin and Litvin developed new CIE course materials and published a paper<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup>,
and for many of the years that followed, Litvin was the university’s primary
CIE teacher.</p>
<p>Later, many other schools began teaching CIE, adding to the course the
application of TRIZ elements to non-technical situations (art, sport, human
interaction, etc.). It became clear that TRIZ and the arts were mutually
beneficial. Some TRIZ schools started including in their CIE courses tours in
art museums, attendance at musical concerts, discussions of fiction, etc.</p>
<p>In 1978 Boris Zlotin taught a 120-hour course in creativity for journalists,
using the CIE course as a foundation. To establish a method for evaluating the
course, a set of high-validity psychological tests was developed that would
measure each student’s creative capabilities before and after the course. This
course included newly-developed techniques for generating ideas for stories,
along with elegant analogies and other elements related to creativity in
literature. These methods were later utilized by the authors and their
colleagues.</p>
<p>During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Simon Litvin taught TRIZ and a CIE
course to a group of leading Russian science fiction writers: Olga Larionova,
Andrey Balabuha, Boris Strugatskiy, and others.</p>
<p>CIE was both educational and entertaining, and by the end of the 1970s had
become a substantial part of TRIZ courses. But in 1980 at the first TRIZ
conference for TRIZ developers, Altshuller appealed to the audience to “kill
CIE.” His reason was that TRIZ was becoming an exact science, with its tools
becoming more powerful and methodical, and thus there was no longer a need for
“CIE crutches.”<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> As a result of this
discussion, the portion of CIE included in TRIZ courses was reduced. It
remained, however, an important part of the TRIZ education for certain types of
students, namely children and non-technical audiences.</p>
<p>In spite of his intentions to “kill” CIE, during the 1980s Altshuller
developed several other CIE methods, including:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Utilization of TRIZ elements (ideality, contradictions, etc.) in
    generating fairy tails and fantasies. Students at TRIZ seminars usually
    completed these exercises with great enthusiasm. Later, some of them used
    fairy tails in children’s education (see below).</li>
  <li>Development of the Fantasy Scale<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup>, which
    incorporated a technique for evaluating and improving science fiction ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the CIE courses being taught, research was conducted by
several TRIZ specialists in various areas of art and performance, including:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Music<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup></li>
  <li>Art and sculpture<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup></li>
  <li>Cartoons<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup></li>
  <li>Poetry<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Extensive research was also conducted in the area of human interaction with
pieces of art based on an approach similar to substance-field analysis by Juliy
and Ingrid Murashkovski (who for many years taught TRIZ creativity methods to
professional artists and architects). Their work included numerous
illustrations, algorithms, case studies and other educational material.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
</font></b>
<p>TRIZ has accumulated a substantial amount of material useful in
psychologically preparing an individual to become an inventor. This material is
useful in enhancing analogical thinking skills, and can be an important asset to
education.</p>
<font size="2"><b>
<p>Development of the creative personality</b></font><sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>In the early 1980s, TRIZ began to gain visibility, due in part to its
connections with Value Engineering (which was supported by the Soviet government<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup>).
This publicity resulted in numerous seminars and workshops on TRIZ in which
several thousand engineers were educated. But in spite of a rigorous (at least
50 hours) education in TRIZ, only a small percentage of students continued to
apply TRIZ in their professional activities. This was extremely disappointing to
Altshuller, who believed that everyone who learned TRIZ should become a lifetime
fan and adopt the mission of disseminating TRIZ throughout the world. In an
attempt to resolve this dilemma, Altshuller initiated a research effort in the
mid-1980s, involving numerous TRIZ specialists and students in the collection
and analysis of information about various creative individuals. The purpose of
this research was to identify patterns in the formation of a creative
personality that could be utilized to increase the effectiveness of TRIZ
education. First were identified the following qualities necessary to become a
lifetime creator:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>A significant personal goal</li>
  <li>The ability to create and carry out an action plan</li>
  <li>Being a hard working individual</li>
  <li>Being experienced in the use of creative problem-solving techniques</li>
  <li>Being persistent (“thick skinned”)</li>
  <li>The ability to achieve intermediate useful results (i.e., to ascertain
    that you are “on the right track”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Together with Igor Vertkin, Altshuller developed the Lifetime Strategy for a
Creative Individual (LSCI), comprising effective actions recommended for an
individual to develop and implement high-level creative goals. LSCI takes the
form of a lifetime “game” between a creator and the “external environment”
that counteracts the creative lifestyle and attempts to convert the inventor
into a passive individual. The six creative qualities along with LSCI eventually
resulted in a branch of TRIZ called the <i>Theory of Building a Creative
Personality (TBCP)</i><sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup><i>.</p>
</i>
<p>According to Altshuller’s usual approach of accumulating a relevant
knowledge base, a substantial amount of information related to the lives of
famous creative people - from Jesus to Lenin - has been amassed. Absent from
this list, however, were contemporary successful business people, politicians,
managers, and creators of huge political and financial empires such as Henry
Ford, Benjamin Franklin, Lee Iacocca, and others. In fact, LSCI was based upon
limited information regarding totalitarian or past societies (before the age of
technology) where creative people were neglected or even despised. As a result,
it reflected a tragic experience, which discouraged people from devoting their
lives to creativity. Yet at the same time it was embraced by a certain type of
pessimistic student, as it served to justify their negative experiences.</p>
<p>After the first version of LSCI was published, many TRIZ developers began
independently conducting their own research in the area of creative
accomplishment. Some results caused certain assumptions of LSCI to come into
question, just as the following conclusions were made:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>The tragic lives led by many inventors was related to the fact that
    because they were extremely creative in certain areas, they didn’t
    consider that the promotion and implementation of their ideas was a process
    that also required creative solutions. They didn’t know how to unveil
    useful resources, make helpful connections, sponsors, etc.</li>
  <li>Often the features of a creative individual that were advantageous in the
    early first stages of a “cause” - such as devotion (or even fanaticism),
    an inability to compromise and/or maneuver, and very high self-esteem - can
    be a detriment during the implementation stage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beginning in the mid-1980s, Altshuller focused on TBCP, virtually abandoning
all other TRIZ work. He considered this subject crucial for the survival of
TRIZ, and recommended that related courses be introduced in all TRIZ schools and
incorporated in the curriculum of independent TRIZ educators. The results of
this promotion were controversial - the majority of students either completely
or partially rejected Altshuller’s approach, and examples of its positive
impact are few<sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For a time, the Kishinev TRIZ School presented LSCI within the context of
safety instructions showing dangers that should be avoided and how this might be
accomplished. Today, we view the subject as a part of more powerful approach,
called <i>Directed Evolution</i>, that allows an individual to control his/her
future<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup>.</p>
<b><font size="2">
<p>Creative education</p>
</font></b>
<p>Today, it is clear that teaching creativity to children is one of the most
significant directions taken by non-technical TRIZ. Altshuller (Altov) pioneered
this endeavor in the mid-1970s with a permanent “inventor’s page” in the
central Soviet children’s newspaper <i>Pionerskaya Pravda</i> (which had more
than 5 million subscribers). Over 50 such pages offered educational material
targeted to teenagers covering the basic TRIZ elements and including practice
problems and inventor’s contests. Typically, between 10,000 to 20,000
responses were obtained per page, all of which were carefully analyzed by
Altshuller and served as a source for the further development of TRIZ and for
advancing the creative education of children. Eventually, these materials became
the foundation for a book<sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>During the 1970s, occasional seminars and classes for children (mostly
teenagers) were conducted in various locations throughout the Soviet Union, and
Atshuller’s inventor’s pages became the instructional materials for these.
In 1982, regular classes were launched in Kishinev. Evgeniya Rabinovich, a
manager at the Children Institute’s “Pioneers’ Palace,” organized a
two-year TRIZ school which held one or two 4-hour classes each week (among the
teachers were Boris Zlotin, Alla Zusman, Len Kaplan, Svetlana Visnepolschi, and
Vladimir Oleynikov). An average class was composed of 15 to 25 children ranging
in age from 10 to 16 years old. This school served as the foundation for a
variety of work, among which resulted the following:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Teachers and students of a local pedagogical college participated and
    practiced in the learning and teaching of TRIZ</li>
  <li>52 monthly TRIZ pages published in the newspaper <i>Youth of Moldova</i>,
    containing new materials on TRIZ and CIE, inventors’ contests, contests
    for the best science fiction stories, etc.</li>
  <li>Television shows in which children who had been educated in TRIZ competed
    with engineers from Kishinev’s industrial companies to solve their
    problems, the results of which were evaluated on the spot by designated
    experts</li>
  <li>A documentary film about TRIZ School was produced and widely shown</li>
  <li>For seven years, TRIZ specialists participated in children’s summer
    schools, teaching TRIZ to groups of 30 to 40 children every year. These
    schools attracted other TRIZ educators as well as professional teachers
    interested in teaching TRIZ to various audiences. As a result:
    </p><ul>
      <li>Over 250 children were taught</li>
      <li>Over 50 teachers gained theoretical and practical experience in TRIZ,
        which later allowed them to organize TRIZ educational programs in their
        originating schools<sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup>.</li>
      <li>A book detailing the experience gained during the summer schools<sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup>
        was written in the form of a diary spanning thirty days of TRIZ classes.
        Even today it is a valuable TRIZ educational book for children, parents
        and teachers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the first attempts at teaching TRIZ to children mainly
addressed students at the middle-school and high-school levels. In 1984, we made
the first attempt to teach TRIZ to 6- and 7-year-olds with a year-long program
held one hour per week at the elementary school. The experiment clearly showed
that very young children can be successfully taught creativity if appropriate
adjustments to the problems are made.</p>
<p>At the same time, we began a monthly publication for young children in the
Moldovian newspaper <i>Young Pioneer</i>. Newspaper articles were written as a
set<sup><a href="#31">31</a></sup> of fairy tails portraying the adventures of a
young boy named Peter and a wise inventor from ancient Greece named Daedalus.
Daedalus worked as an all-knowing aide, helping inventors by guiding them
through the right process and providing them with useful methods and principles.</p>
<p>In 1986 we started an experiment in which the TRIZ approach was used to teach
conventional school subjects. The basic idea was quite simple: students acquired
the necessary knowledge by solving interesting technical problems with the help
of TRIZ tools. Using methods developed for solving scientific problems<sup><a href="#32">32</a></sup>,
students were challenged to find explanations for simple physical experiments.
Students who “invented” the Archimedes’ Law on their own found that this
complex physical law was much easier to understand than if one had learned by
reading a textbook<sup><a href="#33">33</a></sup>. And of course a side effect
of this approach is that, together with the main subject, students learn the
TRIZ basics.</p>
<p>The above experiments started with physics; later the same approach was used
with chemistry, geography, history, literature and social sciences. Eventually,
a book was compiled of TRIZ physics and chemistry lessons<sup><a href="#34">34</a></sup>.
Materials for other subjects were prepared as well, but due to lack of time were
never published.</p>
<p>In the 1980s and 90s many members of the Kishinev TRIZ school, along with
TRIZ specialists from other cities in the former Soviet Union, were involved in
teaching TRIZ to children. In the early 1980s, Len Kaplan became a full-time
TRIZ teacher for a special organization devoted to disseminating and teaching
technical innovations to children. Luba Begam (now in Israel), who had studied
at the two-year TRIZ school mentioned earlier, became a professional TRIZ
teacher. Michael Shusterman, together with his wife Zena, organized a special
center in Norilsk for teaching TRIZ to 4- and 5-year-olds and their teachers<sup><a href="#35">35</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Sergey and Galina Malkin were teaching TRIZ in kindergarten where Galina (a
biologist by education) was working as a teacher. Esther Zlotin and Vladimir
Petrov taught TRIZ in St. Petersburg and later in Israel. A unique experience
was gained by Alla Nesterenko from Petrozavodsk. As daughter of long-time TRIZ
specialist Alexander Selutskiy, she became familiar with TRIZ from an early age;
after graduation she became a teacher at an elementary school<sup><a href="#36">36</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s the economic situation in the former Soviet Union abruptly
deteriorated, virtually ending all opportunities regarding technological TRIZ.
As a result, the majority of TRIZ specialists switched to other areas (see
below), and children’s education became one of the most powerful TRIZ
applications. To the best of our knowledge, most of these organizations today
are represented by <i>TRIZ - Chance</i>, which was organized by a
highly-experienced TRIZ professional, Igor Vikentiev (St. Petersburg). In 1989
he arranged the first conference (which was held in Petrozavodsk) of TRIZ
specialists and educators involved in educating children. Another noteworthy
educational project, <i>Johnatan Livingston</i>, was organized in Minsk by
Nikolai Khomenko. Numerous books and papers have been published devoted to
children’s TRIZ education<sup><a href="#37">37</a></sup>.</p>

<p>One of the most impressive non-technical TRIZ applications was in medicine.
From the 1970s, long-time TRIZ specialist Alexander Selutskii began teaching
TRIZ to students at Petrozavodsk University medical school. Together with his
students, he solved numerous problems related to improving medical equipment and
treatment methods.</p>
<i><u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Example</p>
</u>
<p>Extremely cold winters in Petrozavodsk were the cause of many deaths due to
hypothermia (overcooling). Often, hypothermic victims were found still alive,
but did not survive because there was no safe and effective way to warm them
quickly. The usual methods, which included surrounding the patient with a warm
environment, rubbing the body, and providing warm drinks (including alcohol),
caused blood to rush to the skin surface, depriving crucial organs such as the
heart and brain of oxygen and resulting in death. This problem was addressed -
without success - by several countries during World War II in an attempt to save
the lives of naval and air force personnel operating in cold seas. After the
war, the idea of using microwaves for this purpose was considered, but no
successful results were reported.</p>
<p>After being educated in TRIZ, doctor Tatti came up with the idea of utilizing
the body’s own blood flow as a resource for quickly delivering warmth to the
heart and other important organs. To implement the idea, he suggested applying
heating pads to the places in which the largest arteries are close to the skin
surface, including the neck, underarms, and other areas. This simple method was
responsible for saving many people and resulted in the design of comfortable
work gear for people working in cold open areas. Interestingly, this same idea,
applied in reverse, can help people working in hot areas (i.e., instead of heat,
ice pads are applied to the targeted areas of the body.)</p>
</i>
<p>TRIZ was extensively applied to medicine by physician and TRIZ specialist
Arcadiy Lichachev, Gennadiy Predein, an engineer working for an orthopedic
company, experienced TRIZ specialist Boris Faber, a director at the Russian
Orthopedic Research Institute, and others. Gafur Zainiev utilized TRIZ
approaches in his research related to DNA. In the United States, Ideation has
achieved positive results working with medical equipment and sanitary products.</p>
<p>We believe that medicine should become one of the most important directions
for the utilization of TRIZ, and would like to participate (or facilitate) the
work with such widespread diseases as cancer, AIDS, etc.</p>

<p>Solving scientific problems</p>
</font></b>
<p>The first attempt to apply TRIZ to solving scientific problems (i.e., to make
discoveries) was made by Genrich Altshuller in the early 1960s<sup><a href="#38">38</a></sup>.
Following the procedure described earlier, Altshuller analyzed certain facts
from the history of scientific discoveries. As a result, he identified two types
of discovery:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Discovery of a new fact/phenomenon</li>
  <li>Finding an explanation (discovering a mechanism) to a fact/phenomenon that
    doesn’t comply with existing theories</li>
</ul>
<p>As a next step, Altshuller unveiled and formulated a set of methods that
proved helpful in discovering new facts or developing plausible theories. He
applied these methods to the mystery of Tungusskiy meteorite - a set of
mysterious events associated with a huge meteorite that entered the Earth’s
atmosphere in the early 1900s and disappeared. This work of Altshuller’s might
be dismissed as an exercise in pure fantasy (which it was); however, it resulted
in the invention (prediction!) of the physical phenomenon of the
self-concentration of laser beams in non-linear mediums, later discovered by a
physicist by the name of Askaryan.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, Altshuller disciples Igor Kondrakov and Gennadiy Filkovskiy
completed several works in the above direction discovered by Altshuller. About
the same time, Valery Tzourikov and Georgiy Golovchenko made their discoveries
in the area of astrophysics and plant biology as a result of applying the TRIZ
approach<sup><a href="#39">39</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A significant contribution to the subject was made by Volyuslav Mitrofanov.
As a chief engineering deputy at the large semi-conductor company <i>Svetlana</i>
(the Russian equivalent of Intel) he was actually a high-level troubleshooter.
At the same time he also managed and taught at the largest public TRIZ
University in St. Petersburg, and conducted his own TRIZ research. Working to
implement the first microchips, he faced numerous baffling effects in
production, which had to be resolved. As a result, he solved numerous inventive
and scientific problems and implemented most of his solutions, giving him the
ability to quickly test his scientific ideas. In time, scientific problems
became his main interest. He published several papers and a book on this subject<sup><a href="#40">40</a></sup>,
in which the most important ideas are the following:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Unveiling asymmetry in various systems (from machines to molecules) as the
    underlying cause of contradictions; utilization asymmetry as a driving
    source of evolution; unveiling ways to compensate for asymmetry</li>
  <li>The idea of conducting opposite experiments - i.e., conducting a pair of
    experiments directed toward achieving opposite results or utilizing
    alternative methods. If indeed opposite results were obtained, then a
    critical third experiment was conducted.</li>
  <li>Modifying conventional TRIZ tools and instruments such as the patterns of
    evolution, ideality, contradictions, SF formulas, utilization of analogies,
    etc. for the purpose of solving scientific problems</li>
  <li>A seven-step process for solving scientific problems, including:
    </p><ul>
      <li>Unveiling asymmetry and methods of compensating for it</li>
      <li>Conducting an opposite experiment</li>
      <li>Identifying and resolving physical or technical contradictions</li>
      <li>Utilizing patterns of evolution</li>
      <li>Utilizing resources available in the system and its environment
        (especially time resources)</li>
      <li>Building an ideal model of the solution</li>
      <li>Identifying how to produce an observed phenomenon</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Using this approach, Mitrofanov successfully identified the mechanism
underlying a physical effect named after the physicist Russell (who had
discovered this effect in the 19th century but had no adequate explanation
regarding its nature). Solving this scientific problem, Mitrofanov was able to
build an important device for producing microchips, for which he received a
special award. He also made several other important discoveries in the area of
solid state physics, solved numerous inventive problems, and unveiled the root
causes of numerous production defects (then eliminated them) in the
semi-conductor industry.</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, Boris Zlotin, Mitrofanov’s student and later a TRIZ
educator and board member at St. Petersburg TRIZ University, became involved in
scientific work led by Mitrofanov. In the early 1980s he continued this work
together with Alla Zusman. At that time, they were committed to developing a
system for solving scientific problems and started collecting and documenting
typical scientific problems and solutions following Altshuller’s basic
approach. A year of work yielded only several dozen reliable situations (the
main obstacle, as discussed earlier, was the absence of a system of
documentation - similar to the patent library - of such solutions). It became
clear that their work was “a long shot.” At the same time, Ms. Zusman
suggested utilizing and analyzing a resource that was available - namely, the
scientific problems solved by TRIZ professionals. Together with the
understanding that the nature of scientific problems and production defects (or
failures with unknown root causes) were the same, this approach led to the
formulation of the idea of <i>transferring known TRIZ approaches into a new area</i>.
The only thing that was missing was the actual principle of transfer allowing
the new type of problem to be converted into the known one. In the case of
scientific problems, this principle was known as <i>Problem Inversion</i>.</p>
<p>The essence of Problem Inversion is simple: instead of asking <i>“How can a
certain phenomenon be explained?”</i> one asks <i>“How can this phenomenon
be obtained under existing conditions?)</i> The problem therefore becomes a
typical inventive problem and can be attacked using existing TRIZ tools such as
the innovation principles, ARIZ, Operators, etc.</p>
<p>When solving converted scientific problems the concept of utilizing resources
becomes extremely important. Of course, the utilization of resources is critical
when solving inventive problems, as it helps increase the solution ideality -
but in many situations this might not be possible. In solving scientific
problems, however, the utilization of resources is <i>mandatory</i>, because if
a certain event has already taken place, the necessary resources were in fact
present.</p>
<p>Besides making available the TRIZ tools and approaches, problem inversion
makes it possible to apply conventional technological knowledge to solve
scientific problems.</p>
<i><u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Example</p>
</u>
<p>It is well known that a runner should breathe through the nose rather than
the mouth. Running while breathing deeply through a wide-open mouth quickly
causes the runner to pant for air. Amazing as it sounds, there is no adequate
explanation for why this happens (other than the obvious fact that breathing
through the nose requires more efforts and yields less air). We asked a
physician specializing in sports medicine for an explanation. He gave us two
reasons:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Breathing through the nose warms the air before it enters the lungs, and
    therefore does not cause overcooling of the body</li>
  <li>The nose works as a filter, preventing dust from entering the lungs.</li>
</ul>
<p>After some consideration, both these explanations seemed erroneous. First, in
the summertime we were usually concerned with high ambient temperature rather
than overcooling. Second, the air where we were running was clean enough.</p>
<p>We decided to apply the principle of Problem Inversion to this situation. The
inverted problem therefore became: How can we force a person to pant?</p>
<p>We knew of at least one method: hyperventilation (i.e., breathing deeply and
frequently, which produces the same result - usually explained as the result of
oversaturating the blood with oxygen). The cause was still unclear, however,
because breathing in an oxygen-rich environment doesn’t cause panting.
Moreover, when one is running there is usually a </i>lack <i>of oxygen.</p>
<p>The next step was to look for a similar effect in technology. To make this
transition, it was necessary to create a mechanical model of “breathing.” If
we regarded the lung as a pump, the question became: how can we force this pump
to work ineffectively? As it happened, one of the authors was at that time
working for a company that designed water pumps; he readily ascertained that a
pump works ineffectively if it is not properly loaded. That is, if a pump that
is designed to pump water from 400 meters is forced to work at 4 meters, or work
without any water at all, all the energy consumed by the pump turns to heat and
eventually destroys the pump.</p>
<p>If the above technical fact is applied to that of a runner, the following
hypothesis can be formulated: When one breathes through a wide open mouth, there
is not enough load for the “pump” (lung), which might result in ineffective
work and substantial loss of energy. On the contrary, breathing through the nose
allows the lung to be properly loaded.</p>
<p>We conducted a simple experiment by attempting to breathe through
tightly-closed teeth and half-closed lips. The results were even better than
those obtained when breathing through the nose: it became possible to change the
air resistance depending on the mode of running (a super-effect!).</p>
</i>
<p>The idea of Problem Inversion looks rather simple, yet it resulted in several
non-trivial effects. One of these was the relief from the psychological pressure
of dealing with a “mystery,” which makes scientific problems appear more
difficult than they really are. Another effect is that of breaking the inertia
of accepting a well-known explanation without challenging its validity.
Unfortunately, the accepted explanation is not necessarily the correct one, and
often contains circular definitions or, in the worst case, prevents us from
looking for the true root causes and explanations.</p>
<p>A solution obtained using Problem Inversion lets us formulate a hypothesis
which must be verified (and TRIZ can help with this as well). This approach
essentially transforms the process of solving a scientific problem into one of <i>inventing
an explanatory mechanism</i>. And once the mechanism of a phenomenon is fully
understood, it can be controlled (i.e., amplified, weakened, eliminated, etc.).</p>
<p>The approach described above was successfully applied first by the authors
for the purpose of solving several research problems related to little
understood situations with deep-level water pumps. In 1985 we started teaching
the Problem Inversion approach to our students. One student, Anatoliy Yoisher,
used it to solve a critical problem in the area of micro-wire production that
had gone unresolved for more than 15 years<sup><a href="#41">41</a></sup>. Based
on his solution, he completed his Ph.D. dissertation and was able to quickly
begin production of a new type of micro-wire. To date, dozens of scientific
problems in different areas, including physics, chemistry, math, and biology,
have been solved.</p>
<p>It was also found that the same approach could help in solving criminal
problems and in identifying the root causes of production defects and failures.
This last application became the most effective one. Apparently, people are
usually in no hurry to implement new inventive ideas (especially if the old idea
is adequate), however, finding the root causes of failures and fixing them
quickly provides a tangible return on investment.</p>
<p>Besides solving specific scientific problems, we continued working in the
following areas:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Refining techniques related to the application of TRIZ tools to scientific
    problems</li>
  <li>Unveiling and formulating patterns of evolution of scientific systems
    (theories and hypothesis)</li>
  <li>Developing general methods of building new scientific concepts.</li>
</ul>
<p>To test our findings, we decided to apply them to some large-scale problems.
After careful selection, we identified the following three areas:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Building TRIZ as a conventional science</li>
  <li>The theory of evolution of social systems</li>
  <li>Enhancing the theory of biological evolution</li>
</ul>
<p>The first item has been addressed in previous publications<sup><a href="#42">42</a></sup>.
The other two will be addressed in separate publications.<sup><a href="#43">43</a>

<p>Safety</p>
</font></b>
<p>In 1978 Boris Zlotin, a Value Engineering center leader at <i>Electrosila</i>,
was facilitating a brainstorming session directed toward improving the quality
of one of the company’s products - powerful electrical switches. Working with
one of the critical parts - a contact - Zlotin suggested a reverse
brainstorming: instead of thinking how the part could be improved, try to make
it <i>worse</i>. The first ideas were rather trivial: break the part with a
hammer, make it from non-conductive material, etc. To stimulate more creative
ideas, Zlotin offered the following: “Think how you might damage the part in a
way that is undetectable to quality control, but which would later cause the
part to break - and nobody would be able to figure out it was our fault.” “Do
you mean we should think of sabotage?” asked a team member. “Exactly!”</p>
<p>Ten minutes later one of the participants suggested, jokingly, a slight
deviation from the standard manufacturing process that could produce a failure.
Five minutes later it was discovered that such deviations were happening from
time to time without attracting anyone’s attention. It was immediately
recognized that a very serious accident that had occurred not long before,
resulting in millions of dollars in damages and for which the cause was still
unknown, might be a result of this deviation. A set of simple experiments proved
the hypothesis correct. As a result, the unreliable operation was improved to
prevent dangerous deviations, and additional recommendations for retrofitting
devices already delivered to the customer were developed.</p>
<p>The above brainstorming session gave birth to the idea of the “subversion
approach,” which can be formulated as follows:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Replace the question “<b><i>What kind of production defects, failures or
    other undesirable effects can occur in a given product or process</i></b>?”
    with the following one: “<b>How can the given product or process be made
    to fail, or how can the defects/failures be produced?</b>”</li>
</ul>
<p>The above problem transformation is similar to the Problem Inversion used to
solve scientific problems<sup><a href="#45">45</a></sup>, and converts the
process of failure analysis/prediction into an inventive problem, making
available all the advantages of TRIZ. Once the inverted problem is formulated,
the main focus becomes searching for potential harmful effects that can be
produced in the product or process with the help of the existing resources. In
essence, what we are trying to do is “invent” potential failures. And once a
failure has been invented, the system in question should be examined to
determine if the failure has already occurred or to ascertain the probability
that it will occur in the future. If the failure is possible or has already
occurred, the next (inventive) problem becomes: How can it be prevented?</p>
<p>For example, during an analysis of chemical equipment, we asked the following
question: “How can we create an explosion?” The Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
were certain it was impossible. But a further analysis of the resources required
to produce an explosion resulted in the following list:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Flammable substances capable of burning quickly</li>
  <li>An oxidizer capable of supporting this burning</li>
  <li>An ignitor capable of initiating the burning process</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the components mentioned above were found in the equipment and its
environment, but they were not connected in any way. Thus the next problem to be
solved was “How can we bring these things together and assure their
interaction?” To their surprise, the SMEs found that on rare occasions while
the equipment was being serviced, this dangerous interaction could in fact take
place. Moreover, such situations had occurred in the past but, due to nothing
more than luck, had not resulted in an accident. The next step, of course, was
to eliminate the possibility of an accident, which in this case was not
difficult once the mechanism was understood.</p>
<p>Until the mid-1980s, the “subversion approach” was applied by various
TRIZ specialists in their professions. The approach itself evolved very little,
however, due to the lack of necessary information (in the former Soviet Union,
any information about accidents, catastrophes, or serious design failures was
not available to the public). This situation changed with <i>perestroika</i>,
and once this information became available, we were quickly able to develop a
ten-step algorithm. To support this algorithm we carried out the usual TRIZ
approach of accumulating and organizing knowledge, and the result was a useful
knowledge base organized in the form of the following checklists:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Typical harmful impacts on various systems, including humans and
    organizations</li>
  <li>Typical harmful effects associated with different stages of a system’s
    evolution</li>
  <li>Typical dangerous zones and times in the functioning of a system</li>
  <li>Resources capable of providing harmful effects</li>
  <li>Typical mistakes in system evolution</li>
  <li>Typical root causes leading to harmful mistakes</li>
  <li>Typical method of amplifying harmful effects</li>
  <li>Typical methods of “masking” harmful effects</li>
  <li>Typical methods of preventing harmful effects</li>
</ul>
<p>The subversion algorithm was first tested in 1986 during the analysis of a
production line in a large shoe factory in Kishinev. The effort resulted in the
generation of 18 potential production failures that were at first regarded as
absurd. Later, however, it was found that 12 of these failures had already taken
place, with at least three resulting in substantial losses.</p>
<p>From the mid 1990s, Ideation has been marketing “subversion analysis”
under the name Anticipatory Failure Determination (AFD<font face="Symbol">Ô</font>)
as an application of the Ideation/TRIZ Methodology. AFD contains two main
algorithms, or processes:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Failure Analysis (identifying the root causes of a failure that has
    already occurred)</li>
  <li>Failure Prediction (identifying potential failures that might occur)</li>
</ul>
<p>A comparison of AFD with other failure techniques used in American industry
(such as FMEA, HAZOP, etc.) has shown the following:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Because of the TRIZ-nature (i.e., inventiveness) of AFD, it is much more
    aggressive and proactive. As a result, AFD is repeatedly found to reveal new
    problems and dangers in products and processes that had been previously
    analyzed with traditional methods.</li>
  <li>AFD is compatible (and complementary) with traditional techniques, also
    due to its TRIZ nature (i.e., it targets creativity where other techniques
    do not)</li>
  <li>Complementing AFD with TRIZ tools and approaches to problem solving allows
    one to generate cost-effective solutions to hidden problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the late 1990s, software supporting the AFD process was developed. It
included the following modules:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Failure Analysis</li>
  <li>Failure Prediction</li>
  <li>Failure Prevention /Elimination</li>
</ul>
<p>With this software, together with special educational material, AFD training
could be conducted in a 2- to 5-day course.</p>

<p>Social and business applications of TRIZ</p>
</font><i>
<p>Underlying theory</p>
</i></b>
<p>In 1984 Boris Zlotin and Alla Zusman started researching the evolution of
social systems using TRIZ as well as their work in developing techniques to
build scientific concepts. We defined a social system as one of the following:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Enterprise</li>
  <li>Government agency</li>
  <li>Professional association</li>
  <li>Social institution</li>
  <li>Educational institution</li>
  <li>Family</li>
  <li>Country</li>
  <li>Society as a whole</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time, looking for new information about social systems was rather
dangerous in the Soviet Union because of the KGB. The authors therefore
initially limited themselves to small organizations such as company divisions or
sports teams - areas in which they were knowledgeable. Focusing on small
organizations turned out to be a useful endeavor, as it was easier to apply the
TRIZ approach and reveal patterns when smaller systems were targeted.</p>
<p>The main idea that we wished to prove was that the evolution of any
organization follows certain patterns, which can be ascertained and utilized for
the purpose of enhancing an organization.</p>
<p>For several years, the authors pursued this work only halfheartedly - they
knew how difficult it would be not only to obtain accurate information but to
publish anything that differed from the official communist statements. But
things changed significantly with the onset of <i>perestroika</i>, and in a
short period of time many important Western books in history, economics,
sociology, business, marketing and other areas were translated into Russian and
made available to the public. At the same time, the establishment of so-called
“private” companies was allowed, and in early 1986 the members of the
Kishinev TRIZ school established a private engineering company and Scientific
and Technological Center (STC) called Progress (which happened to be one of the
Soviet Union’s first private engineering companies). STC “Progress” began
educating various industrial companies in TRIZ and providing analytical services
in problem solving<sup><a href="#46">46</a></sup>.</p>
<p>By working with various commercial and political organizations we were able
to gain access to confidential political, social and economic information, and
thus we formed a strong foundation for our previous theoretical conclusions, and
were able to verify and test the methods and tools we had developed. Our work
gained a practical focus and allowed us to apply these methods and tools to
solving social, management, business and other problems, and to analyze specific
social systems. We were joined in these efforts by many other TRIZ specialists<sup><a href="#47">47</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The essence of the Theory of Evolution of Organizations was first presented
to the students at the January 1987 TRIZ seminar in Moscow. More detailed
material was discussed at a TRIZ seminar for professional sociologists (held in
Miass in May, 1988<sup><a href="#48">48</a></sup>) and at a seminar for managers
(in Komsomolsk-on-Amur in April, 1991<sup><a href="#49">49</a></sup>). Later,
Zlotin and Zusman conducted two seminars for TRIZ professionals where about half
the time was devoted to the Theory of Evolution of Organizations<sup><a href="#50">50</a></sup>
and to solving problems in management and business (Simferopol, January 1992 and
Petrozavodsk, October 1992)<sup><a href="#51">51</a></sup>.</p>
<b><i>
<p>Practical applications of methods developed by the Kishinev TRIZ school</p>
</i></b>
<p>Theoretical findings in the area of organizational and societal evolution
were soon tested in the following practical endeavors:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Organizational and business analysis of various technical projects
    completed by STC Progress for various industrial companies</li>
  <li>The complex analysis and development of directions for improving and
    further evolving the Moscow Commodity Exchange (1991-1992). This project
    resulted in more than 200 suggestions for improvement and growth, in
    particular:
    </p><ul>
      <li>Enhancing MCE operation and service</li>
      <li>Increasing the volume of operations</li>
      <li>Developing new services</li>
      <li>Developing new principles and methods of advertisement</li>
      <li>Enhancing operational and personnel safety</li>
      <li>Formation of an effective organizational culture</li>
      <li>Lobbying for MCE in the Parliament of the former Soviet Union</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Later the methods and approaches proven effective in the MCE project were
used in:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>The analysis and improvement of banks and insurance companies<sup><a href="#52">52</a></sup></li>
  <li>A government project for supporting people with disabilities<sup><a href="#53">53</a></sup></li>
  <li>Consulting for Gasprom, the largest gas company in Russia<sup><a href="#54">54</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<b><i>
<p>Other applications in business and politics</p>
</i></b>
<p>In the early 1990s Igor Vikentiev began applying and teaching TRIZ principles
in advertisement and journalism. He collected a bank of creative solutions and
developed principles similar to the 40 Innovation Principles for making
impressive publications and advertisements<sup><a href="#55">55</a></sup>. A
book<sup><a href="#56">56</a></sup> and an operational web site<sup><a href="#57">57</a></sup>
are available on the subject.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s TRIZ principles were applied to political situations - in
particular, to election campaigns of several members of the Russian parliament<sup><a href="#58">58</a></sup>
and to the presidential elections in Moldova<sup><a href="#59">59</a></sup>.
TRIZ was also successfully applied in professional consulting endeavors
concerning the election campaign<sup><a href="#60">60</a></sup>.</p>
<b><i>

<p>By November of 1992, when we first came to the United States to discuss the
possibility of establishing an American TRIZ-based company, the <i>Tools for
Managers</i> software (later called <i>Management WorkBench) </i>was in better
shape than the equivalent software for technical problems, the <i>Innovation
WorkBench™</i>. For the reasons described above, however, further development
of management software was put on hold. Today we are moving ahead with the
release of the <i>Knowledge Wizard</i>™ - a new software analytical tool for
analyzing and modeling non-technical situations and formulating
directions/opportunities for resolving them. The Knowledge Wizard is based on
the <i>Problem Formulator</i>™ (US Patent No 5,581,663) and has a limited
number of recommendations for addressing generated opportunities. The next step
is the <i>Management WorkBench</i> software, which will contain a comprehensive
knowledge base in the related area.</p>

<p>Chapter 2. Evolution of Organizations: Theoretical Findings and Practical
Applications</p>
<p>The underlying theory, tools and processes</p>
</font></b>
<p>The underlying theory of the evolution of organizations is based on the
following assumptions:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>The existence of universal (or general) patterns of evolution</li>
  <li>The transferability of models (explanatory mechanisms) - that is, models
    proven effective in one area can be applied to other areas given the
    appropriate conditions and limitations</li>
</ul>
<p>… and includes the following sections:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>A theoretical foundation providing a unified approach to various problems,
    including:
    </p><ul>
      <li>Poly-model approach</li>
      <li>Non-linear approach</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Analytical tools and processes which support the analysis of existing
    organizations and identify effective approaches to enhancing them</li>
  <li>Innovation knowledge-base tools encompassing the best practices in
    organizational improvement, structured according to typical problems related
    to desired enhancements</li>
  <li>Computerized tools</li>
</ul>
<b><i>
<p>Poly-model approach</p>
</i></b>
<p>We define the poly-model approach as a method for creating theories through <b><i>the
development of a necessary and sufficient amount of simple but compatible (or
complementary) models that together support the understanding and prediction of
a system’s behavior</i></b>.</p>
<p>Ways in which the appropriate models can be created/applied are as follows:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Application of existing models accepted in various scientific and
    technological areas (see the transferability of models assumption, above)</li>
  <li>Building of new models based on mechanics, physics, chemistry,
    cybernetics, biology, etc.<a href="#61"><sup>61</sup></a></li>
  <li>Each model should be accompanied by a description of the conditions and
    limitations under which it can be effectively utilized</li>
</ul>
<p>To reveal models that are useful with regard to the evolution of
organizations, we have studied the effective models applied to various human
activities, primarily in the following areas:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Existing social and economic sciences</li>
  <li>Synergistic theory of evolution of non-linear systems</li>
  <li>Cybernetics and information theory</li>
  <li>TRIZ as an evolutionary science</li>
  <li>Various evolutionary theories in biology, cosmology, etc.</li>
  <li>Psychology</li>
  <li>Stress concept by H. Selye</li>
  <li>Nosology (study of the incidence, distribution, and control of disease in
    a population)</li>
  <li>Trophology (science having to do with the natural food chain)</li>
  <li>Physics, chemistry and other natural sciences</li>
</ul>
<b><i>
<p>Non-linear approach</p>
</i></b>
<p>The non-linear approach includes the following assumptions:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Any organization and even humanity as a whole constitutes a non-linear
    system, the evolution of which is determined by three distinct types of
    processes:
    </p><ul>
      <li>Smooth and predictable evolution, during which the principles of
        natural selection (market acceptance) are in action.</li>
      <li>Periodic crises, during which the system’s behavior becomes
        unpredictable (although it can remain controllable). Each crisis ends
        with the (random) selection of one of the potential “paths” for
        further evolution, resulting in a change in the system’s evolutionary
        trajectory.<br>
        <img border="0" src="01.gif" width="403" height="213"></li>
      <li>Periodic avalanche-like events caused by positive feedback
        (reinforcing loop)<br>
        <img border="0" src="02.gif" width="351" height="163"></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>System structure depends on various flows passing through the system that
    can change its structure or destroy it (flows passing through the
    super-system can create the system). Specific flows that pass through and
    change/form our social system are transposition of people, goods, documents
    (instructions, assignments, orders), money, credits, bonds, information,
    services, etc.</li>
</ul>
<b><i>
<p>Important assumptions related to the linkage between an organization, its
business/cause/ mission and its stage of evolution</p>
</i></b>
<p>It is known that, in general:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>The majority of an organization’s features are determined by the stage
    of its evolution along the S-curve</li>
  <li>The evolution of an organization strongly depends on the S-curve position
    of its main business<sup><a href="#62">62</a></sup></li>
  <li>At the same time, the business of an organization can be impacted
    (positively or negatively) by the S-curve position of an organization</li>
</ul>
<b><font size="2">
<p>Analytical tools and processes</p>

<p>The TRIZ analytical tools used to analyze organizations include:</p>

  <li>Situation assessment questionnaire</li>
  <li>Situation analysis and development of recommendations process</li>

<p>Social flows - </i>flows passing through a social system, such as the
transposition of people, goods, documents (instructions, assignments, orders),
money, credit, bonds, information, services, etc. Historically, social flows
emerge as a result of the distribution of work between people and the resulting
need to exchange products. The social structure is randomly formed in a way that
supports the increase of useful flows<sup><a href="#72">72</a></sup>. Useful
structures can be establish and administered/managed through the establishment,
administration, and management of the social flows passing through the given
structure.</p>
<i>
<p>Mechanism </i>- a driving force or chain of events resulting in a certain
outcome. An <i>explanatory (hypothetical) mechanism</i> supports credible
speculation that explains the nature of an event (outcome).</p>
<p>The main assumptions are as follows:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Social flows are produced by <i>resource gradients </i>- i.e., the excess
    of a specific resource in one place and its deficit in another.</li>
  <li>Any social flow (or its component) that passes through a specific social
    system produces (supports and/or strengthens) a certain structure.</li>
  <li>A social system produced by a certain flow tends toward self-preservation
    (homeostasis) and growth in the following ways:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Growing (strengthening) the flow that originated this system</li>
    <li>Flow diversification - i.e., an increase in the structure of flow
      components</li>
    <li>Prevention of (or resistance to) flow interruption</li>
    <li>Generation of a “flow substitute” if exhaustion of the initial flow
      is inevitable</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
  <li>The structurization and diversification of a flow results in the
    structurization and diversification of social structure</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>The above mechanisms result in positive feedback (reinforcing loop) between
  the flows and structures: the growth/structurization of a flow produces the
  growth/structurization of social structures that support this flow, and vice
  versa.</p>
  <i><u>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Example</p>
  </u></i><i>
  <p>Soon after the prohibition laws were passed in the United States, the
  random flow of illegal alcohol sales began. Soon afterwards, however, Mafia
  organizations arose and quickly evolved into complex, well-developed
  structures which were managed at least as effectively as legal corporations
  and sometimes more effectively than many government agencies. These structures
  successfully supported an increase in alcohol consumption and fought against
  the abolishment of prohibition. When prohibition ended, the Mafia did not
  disappear (as some legislators had probably hoped) but instead switched to
  another illegal activity (such as drugs trafficking).</p>
  </i>
  <p>It has been proven that special organizations established for the purpose
  of distributing limited goods attempt to support the deficit; organizations
  established to fight certain crimes tend to merge with criminal organizations
  (corruption).</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
  <li>The main problem associated with social flows is that the free exchange of
    goods in a non-linear, uncontrollable (i.e., unregulated) social system
    causes the system to become unstable. Flow stabilization can be achieved if
    a special regulating system for administrating/managing/controlling the
    production and distribution of goods is established.</li>
  <li>The following types of regulation exist:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Traditional regulation - a situation in which all procedures are
      regulated by established traditions. This system is effective in small
      groups and under stable conditions. Significant change (growth or
      reduction) in flows causes dissociation of the traditional regulating
      systems.</li>
    <li>Forced administration - involves purposefully established organizations
      that possess certain powers that do not depend on flow parameters.</li>
    <li>Economic management (based on free market principles)</li>
    <li>Charismatic leadership - based on various ideological (political)
      influences involving emotions, faith (religious or otherwise), hopes, etc.
      Such a system might be very effective for a short period of time and/or
      for a limited audience (involves psychology, as different people react
      differently to ideological issues).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We will address further the two main regulation systems: Forced
Administration (FA) and Economic Management (EM).</p>
<b><i>
<p>Forced Administration (FA)</p>
</i></b>
<p>The FA system can be characterized by the following features:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Every individual (or organization) is a “consumer” of certain flows.
    Some individuals/organizations complement this role by being a flow “producer”
    or a flow “administrator.”</li>
  <li>The administrator controls the flow between consumers and producers,
    getting a certain portion of the flow as a reward. Also, the administrator
    has the prospect of obtaining the best portion (“skimming the cream”).<br>
    <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><img src="03.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025" width="402" height="174"></span></font><br>
  </li>
  <li>The administrator controls the activities of the producer and consumer by
    cutting off the incoming flows. This works <i>only </i>if the producer or
    consumer does not have access to independent flow sources or cannot
    accumulate resources. To ensure absolute control, the FA system does not
    allow independent flows to exist.</li>
  <li>The FA system is sufficiently stable if flows in the social system are not
    entirely sufficient for completely satisfying the primary living
    requirements of the people.</li>
  <li>To maintain the ability to “skim the cream” and to provide a certain
    stability (e.g., in case of a poor harvest), it is necessary to motivate the
    producer to supply a higher flow. The administrator, however, cannot consume
    the entire flow all at once, and also cannot allow the excessive flow to
    reach the consumer (which will make the consumer less controllable and can
    eventually destroy the system).</li>
  <li>This problem stated in 5 above has been intuitively resolved in all known
    FA systems by the following: a portion of the flow is “grounded” - i.e.,
    removed from circulation.<br>
    <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  </li>
  <li>A grounded flow must be managed by its own administrator (A1), who
    benefits from the flow and thus is motivated to increase it - a special
    positive feedback for the grounding.<br>

  </li>
  <li>Flow grounding can be achieved in the following ways:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Sacrifices to gods</li>
    <li>The accumulation of treasures, building of pyramids, temples, palaces,
      etc.</li>
    <li>Army and safety</li>
    <li>Prestigious projects</li>
    <li>Investing in fundamental science, arts<sup><a href="#73">73</a></sup>,
      etc.</li>
    <li>The freeing of certain groups of people (e.g., soldiers, ministers,
      clerks) from producing</li>
    <li>The prosecution of people capable of producing an excess of products
      (such as entrepreneurs and inventors); suppression of creativity and
      ambition; the converting of creators into administrators.</li>
  </ul>
  <i><u>
  <p>Example</p>
  </u>
  <p>Typical examples of grounding flows are: the Egyptian and Mexican pyramids;
  the Great Wall of China (which made no military sense); the ambitious
  construction plans of Hitler and Stalin; the ridiculous production of huge
  numbers of military tanks; the building of hydro-stations on flat land
  (plains), which is not economically prudent and damages the environment;
  projects in the former Soviet Union to reverse great Siberian rivers, etc</i><sup><a href="#74">74</a></sup><i>.
  To an extent, some of the Pentagon’s expensive projects can be included
  here, as well as the race to the Moon, the purchasing of corporate jetliners,
  etc.</p>
  </blockquote>
</i>
<ol start="9">
  <li>A typical contradiction associated with an FA system is as follows: <b><i>A
    continuos increase in productivity is followed by an increase in the amount
    of grounded flow</i></b>. Sooner or later, however, the rate of increase of
    the grounded flow outpaces the rate of increase in production, as the latter
    is limited by the availability of resources. The eventual outcome is the
    waste of resources, damage to the environment, and a deterioration in the
    quality of life.</li>
  <li>FA systems are a usual attribute of totalitarian and authoritarian
    societies (organizations), which allow the existence of only two classes:
    the poor and the elite (no middle class) and in which is formed a typical
    style of relationships between producers, consumers and administrators,
    usually leading to the formation of castes and the suppression of personal
    initiative.</li>
  <li>The stability of an FA tends to decline for the following reasons:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>The power and complexity of a social structure increases to such an
      extent that effective control is no longer possible, resulting in various
      deficits and the necessity of continuously correcting the plans</li>
    <li>Information transmitted from the bottom up about real flows becomes
      invalid</li>
    <li>Disorder and disturbances in bureaucratic operations, resulting in a
      loss of coordination between elements of the bureaucracy, etc.</li>
    <li>Flow growth and diversification always decrease an FA’s rigidity,
      loosening its restraints and thus facilitating its decomposition (a
      paradox).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<ol start="12">
  <li>The simplest way to improve an FA is expansion - that is, spreading out
    into other organizations, lands, activities, etc. This “kills two birds
    with one stone”: for a short period of time increased flows outpace
    grounding; military conditions justify increasing an administration’s
    strictness. Altogether, this process improves the situation for a while
    (sometimes for one or two generations), however, because the problem is not
    completely resolved it will require the next expansion within time,
    rendering the policy of any FA country (or commercial organization)
    aggressive and expansionistic.</li>
  <li>When the possibility of expansion is exhausted, an FA launches experiments
    directed to the growth of flows in the following ways:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Improvement of tools</li>
    <li>Improving the organization of collective work</li>
    <li>Motivating producers to increase their productivity by turning over a
      portion of the produced flows to them</li>

<ol start="14">
  <li>Turning over to the producers a portion of the produced flows inevitably
    leads to the destruction of the FA, for the following reasons:</li>
</ol>
</p><ul>
  <li>The producer accumulates economic resources (i.e., an excess of products)
    that provide him/her with a certain independence from the administrator
    (i.e., the latter cannot manage the producer by cutting off the incoming
    flows)</li>
  <li>The producer can sell or exchange the excess with another producer,
    creating “side” flows that are independent of the existing
    administrators. These side flows generate their own structures that compete
    with the original FA.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="15">
  <li>The FA tries to protect itself from destruction in the following ways:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Economic (confiscation, inflation, etc.)</li>
    <li>Administrative (centralization, planning, bureaucratic obstacles)</li>
    <li>Political (enforcement of power, various prohibitions, declaring a “state
      of emergency,” etc.)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<ol start="16">
  <li>Further flow growth can lead to the following two variants:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Catastrophic disintegration of the FA and a return to the previous stage
      in the societal evolution in the form of smaller, separated, independent
      (and often fighting one another) tribes or countries, followed by an
      abrupt reduction of flows (e.g., the fall of the Roman Empire, the
      disintegration of the USSR).</li>
    <li>Transition to the economic management (EM) system if the following
      conditions are in place:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Sufficient level of social flows (wealth)</li>
        <li>Existence of money as a universal equivalent of cost</li>
        <li>Restrictions in basic economic laws; human rights protection</li>
        <li>People’s readiness to accept a democratic form of government</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<i><u>
<p>Example</p>
</u>
<p>Most historians believe that ancient Rome was destroyed because of the
inefficiency of slavery. The facts do not support this theory, however. On the
contrary, the Roman Empire had by that time widely introduced several
significant improvements in production:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Utilization of slaves (live machines) analogous to the principle of
    distribution of work in a factory. This resulted in the growth of large
    estates and ruined small farms.</li>
  <li>Creation of a system of small producers who rented land and paid their
    landlords with a portion of the production</li>
  <li>Implementation of more effective agricultural tools</li>
  <li>Diversification of flows (production of luxurious products, arms, legal
    systems, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, granting permission for barbarians to settle on Roman lands provided
the introduction of fresh power, new technologies (such as the treatment of
iron) and - most important of all - new markets. Altogether, this led to a
substantial growth of flows and caused an unprecedented expansion of?
bureaucracy and methods for grounding flows. This in turn resulted in crisis,
disintegration, and five centuries of barbarism, wars and collapsing economies
until finally a powerful new government consisting of Roman Popes and kings in
Germany, France and England was established. Rome was ruined by growing flows,
which made its FA system fat; the Romans started grounding too many flows and
their production became ineffective. Reasons similar to these - the incapability
of an FA system to “digest” growing flows - led to the Crusades during the
Middle Ages, the French Revolution, and Russian </i>perestroika<i>.</p>
</i>
<p>The transition to an EM system eventually increases the wealth of all members
of the society. However, in the beginning of this transition it is necessary to
concentrate resources as possessions of individuals (or groups) that are capable
of better organizing and utilizing them. These individuals/groups are usually
the most entrepreneurial and often immoral, which decreases the quality of life
of the average member of the society until the new system is fully established
and benefits all members.</p>
<b><i>
<p>Economic management (EM)</p>
</i></b>
<p>The EM system is characterized by the following features:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Every individual (or organization) serves as producer, consumer and
    administrator of certain flows.</li>
  <li>Everyone is involved in various feedback circuits representing free market
    relationships that convert administrators into mediators. Mediators
    (wholesale and retail salesmen) connect producers and end consumers.<br>
    <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><img src="07.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025" width="286" height="206"></span></font></li>
  <li>An EM is always associated with democracy; it assumes a high level of
    responsibility, motivates independent and entrepreneurial ways of thinking
    which in turn leverages the wealth of the individual members involved.</li>
  <li>A flow analysis shows that EM and democracy are not compatible with
    poverty. This fact explains why attempts to build a democratic society
    (similar to that of the United States or Europe) in developing countries are
    dangerous mistakes, usually resulting in a return to an authoritarian or
    totalitarian system.</li>
  <li>The stability of an EM depends on the level of wealth, which should be
    high enough to ensure that even the poorest have food and shelter. Also,
    some excessiveness is required to compensate for the natural oscillation
    (potential abrupt downsizing) of flows. In the absence of a reserve, natural
    catastrophes (poor harvests, wars, etc.) lower the flows and produce crises;
    people whose elementary needs are not satisfied often riot. These riots may
    become serious disturbances, initiating a chain reaction of disintegration.
    For this reason, it is often very useful to temporarily switch to an FA
    system in an emergency, as when Franklin Roosevelt introduced his New Deal
    in the United States, or when governmental control of industry was
    instituted in England during the Second World War.</li>
  <li>If the temporary introduction of an FA is under the control of a
    democratic institution, it can be successfully reversed when it is no longer
    needed. The situation is much worse if power is illegally seized by a group
    of FA adepts, as occurred in Russia in 1917. In this case it meant robbing
    the limited number of wealthy people and dividing their wealth among the
    masses. In the beginning, the life of the average individual improved -
    however, the lack of protection of personal property eventually eliminated
    the majority of flows and resulted in decades of deterioration<sup><a href="#75">75</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>
<b><i>
<p>Basic political systems and their transformations</p>
</i></b>
<p>The matrix below demonstrates various models of social systems developed by
Bulgarian dissident Zheliu Zhelev<sup><a href="#76">76</a></sup>, who defined
three main political systems as follows:</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><img src="08.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025" width="451" height="178"></span></font></p>
<u>
<p>From Totalitarianism to Democracy</u><b><i>. </i></b>Zheliu Zhelev discovered
that the transition from a totalitarian system to a democracy must go through an
authoritarian (dictatorship) system (as occurred successfully in Spain, Chili,
South Korea, Taiwan, etc.). The reason for this is that, as mentioned earlier, a
democracy cannot exist without a middle class representing a certain level of
wealth (flows). The economic growth in turn requires a stable political
situation with appropriate legal support, which can be provided by strong
leadership in the case where a democracy does not yet exist. Once the required
level of wealth has been accumulated and the middle class is established, the
transition to democracy can be relatively smooth.</p>
<p>As stated previously, attempts to jump from totalitarianism to democracy
without an intermediate authoritarianism can be fatal. For example, a free
political system with a restricted economy typically leads to chaos. The escape
lies in dictatorship - however a dictatorship can be of a “right-wing” or
“left-wing” type. A “right-wing” dictatorship (authoritarianism)
represents the power of a wealthy, economically competent minority; it usually
restricts political life and allows the economy to grow. A leftist dictatorship
represents the power of the poor, economically incompetent majority; it
restricts both the economy and politics, and eventually returns to
totalitarianism. The FA system inherent in totalitarianism usually tries to
maintain its position, and thus does not stimulate flow growth and eventually
reproduces the poverty.</p>
<u>
<p>From Democracy to Totalitarianism</u>. As mentioned earlier, democracy is
stable until the a sufficient level of wealth is attained. If for any reason the
flows decline, a lack of control can lead to chaos -an unstable situation that
can fall into one of two types of dictatorship (see above).</p>
<blockquote>
  <i><u>
  <p>Example</p>
  </u>
  <p>The French revolutions and Napoleon’s wars destroyed existing social
  structures, spread revolutionary ideas throughout Europe, and readied the
  masses ready for riots, robbery, and the re-allotment of land, diminishing the
  value of human life. It also became clear that attempts to quickly establish
  democratic institutions led to corruption and sometimes terror. As a result
  the situation in Europe was unstable and very dangerous.</p>
  <p>The Viennese Congress arranged in 1815-16 stabilized the situation by
  instituting strong measures. The Holy Alliance established by the Viennese
  Congress ruthlessly suppressed any attempt at revolution or violence, flooded
  the countries of Europe with political spies, and introduced strict censorship
  of books and public speeches. Doesn’t look promising, does it?</p>
  <p>Although called as the “Age of Reaction”, the next 40 years were
  peaceful; industry and trade received significant support - for technology,
  transportation, and financial systems it was a Golden Age. Life for many
  people and the economy as a whole improved significantly, creating a basis for
  a real democracy.</p>
  </i>
</blockquote>
<b><i>
<p>Combination of various administration/management systems</p>
</i></b>
<p>Usually, in a mature organization elements of all administration/management
systems exist, having the following functions:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>A Forced Administration (FA) system usually play the role of a “skeleton”
    around which the organization is constructed. The FA includes people
    (usually strong administrators), structure and hierarchy, rules and
    regulations (written or not, both mandatory), and cultural elements. The
    organization’s skeleton can be rigid or soft; each type has its own
    advantages and disadvantages, as follows:
    </p><ul>
      <li>A rigid skeleton ensures an organization’s survival during difficult
        times, and increases its stability against destructive impacts. However,
        a rigid skeleton limits an organization’s dynamism and adaptability,
        as well as the initiative and creativity of its people.</li>
      <li>A soft skeleton provides greater flexibility and adaptability to
        changing conditions. Too much freedom, however, can result in a loss of
        focus.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An Economic Management (EM) system serves as the “flesh and muscle” of
    an organization and provides for its effective functioning, rapid growth,
    and the appropriate treatment and consumption of flows. It also connects
    various parts of the organization and resolves contradictions that arise
    inside the rigid skeleton.</li>
  <li>Elements of traditional regulations help establish the organizational
    culture</li>
  <li>Elements of charismatic leadership help motivate people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different administration/management systems can have additional relationships
that are useful for an organization. Unfortunately, this can create the opposite
effect as well. The FA system often takes charge and enforces a bureaucracy that
can ruin the organization. The “treatment” lies in splitting the power
between several institutions (as with the American principle of separating the
legislative, presidential, and judicial systems).</p>
<p>The contradiction is as follows: FA systems are necessary to provide the
skeleton of an organization, however (and as was shown earlier), the FA system
is responsible for grounding the useful flows. This contradiction can be
resolved, for example, by the redirection or redistribution of the grounded
flows so that they work for the society. Other creative resolutions of this
contradiction are possible.</p>
<b><i>
<p>Administration/management systems and an organization’s evolution along the
S-curve</p>
</i></b>
<p>The evolution of an organization begins in Stage 1 - infancy or start-up -
with the formation of its main business/mission/cause; this might be the
production of something, a service of some sort, research, the establishment of
an entertainment group, etc. To run the business, certain flows have to be
organized through the system (materials, energy, information, money, etc.). In
the beginning the flow routes are not completely defined, and thus the entire
structure is rather amorphous. Usually there is a recognized leader who serves
to “cement” the organization. There might also be a small team (from 5 to 9
people) that the leader can manage. Power and assignments are distributed
randomly, according to the principle of self-organization. Everyone does
whatever is most needed at the moment (this requires people who are flexible and
possess initiative). There are usually more functions than there are people to
perform them - it is therefore important that people possess universal skills.</p>
<p>As the flow grows and properly channels the organization, its structure
becomes certain and solidifies. The process of distributing functions,
responsibilities and rewards (specialization and work distribution) takes place,
increasing the overall effectiveness of the organization. New people with
appropriate (and specialized) educations join the organization. Those having
universal skills who were present during start-up leave or move to the top of
the organization where there is always room for people with universal and
entrepreneurial skills.</p>
<p>The transition to Stage 2 (rapid growth) is associated with the establishment
of a well-defined structure both of the organization and its business.
Organizational rules and regulations have been developed. The organization’s
skeleton becomes coherent and logical, although it is not yet rigid (cartilage
instead of bones): some parts may still be absent and complemented by amorphous,
start-up elements. Gradually the skeleton becomes complete and includes all the
elements necessary for normal operation along with some protective elements. By
the middle of the second stage the skeleton is solid, however, it has points of
growth and transformation (“hinges” or meristems) which allow for some
change, such as re-orientation for the purpose of performing other functions.
Resting on the rigid skeleton, other, softer parts of the organization (such as
marketing or research) can successfully function while maintaining a high level
of initiative (within certain limitations defined by the skeleton, however).</p>
<p>The structure of the organization becomes pyramid-shaped (hierarchical) with
the core technology or business serving as the base of the pyramid. The
hierarchy can become larger, multiplying itself in a nearly unlimited fashion.
Typical growth at this stage is in the form of expansion (including conquest)
and is fairly congruent - that is, the growth of the pyramid’s upper
structures is in proportion with its base (there is no distortion to the pyramid
shape).</p>
<p>The exhaustion of the resources required for business growth brings the
organization to Stage 3 (maturity), where the growth of the pyramid base is very
limited. The upper layers of the pyramid continue grow in accordance with the
Parkinson’s law<sup><a href="#77">77</a></sup>, however. Bureaucracy begins
devouring the resources that belong to the business (for example, a “brain
drain” of the best people into administration and management takes place,
providing them with better chances for lucrative careers). As a result, the
pyramid becomes disproportionate or even loses its pyramid shape (see figure
below). Growth of the bureaucracy requires a strengthening of the
administration/management system, and results in a decrease in the quality of
decisions.</p>

institution, educational institution, family, country, or human society<sup><a href="#79">79</a></sup>
as a whole.</p>
<p>The <i>business</i> of an organization - its core technology, actual

<p>Organization’s <i>S-curve</i> <i>plus </i>- the traditional S-curve
extended to six (instead of the usual three) main stages. Stages 1, 2 and 3 are
divided into sub-stages (the beginning, middle, and end) as follows<sup><a href="#80">80</a></sup>:</p>

</font>
<p>The main assumptions are as follows:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>The majority of an organization’s features are determined by it’s

  <li>Selected features (such as the number and size of hierarchical levels) can

  <li>The evolution of an organization strongly depends on the S-curve position

  <li>At the same time, the business of an organization can be impacted
    (positively or negatively) by the S-curve position of an organization.</li>
  <li>The “S-curve plus” presented above represents a natural evolution

<i><b>
<p>Analysis of an organization’s position on the “S-curve plus” and the
development of recommendations for improvement</b></i><sup><a href="#83">83</a></sup></p>
<p>The analysis of an organization’s position on the S-curve plus includes the
following approaches:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Analysis of the business</li>
  <li>Analysis of organization</li>
</ul>
<p>An analysis of the organization’s position includes the following steps:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Utilization of the Organization Feature Matrix as a diagnostic tool to
    identify position</li>
  <li>Identification of typical objectives and mistakes for the identified
    position</li>
  <li>Identification of features that must be corrected to improve the situation</li>
</ul>
<i><u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Utilization of the Matrix</p>
</u></i>
<p>The matrix contains several dozen features, including the main contradiction,
the organization’s size, management system, the organizational structure,
prestige, morale and environment, discipline, and others. Each feature has a
different content for each of the three main S-curve stages and desired
Contrived Dynamic Prosperity stage.<sup><a href="#84">84</a></sup>?</p>
<p>For each feature we have identified the stage that matches the organization’s
“reality” and have mapped it on the S-curve (see figure). The place where
the features are concentrated shows the position of the organization.</p>
<p>Once the position is defined (Stage 1, end) we can identify the typical
objectives and typical mistakes from the bank of knowledge. For the selected
sub-stage this will be:</p>
<i><u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Typical objectives</p>

</ul>
<i><u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Typical mistakes</p>
</u></i>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Typical mistakes in the development of the business or core technology</li>
</ol>
<p>Typical mistakes in evolution are usually associated with deviations from a
certain optimal strategy. The selection of this optimal strategy is usually a
matter of the leader’s intuition and experience in implementing something new.
Deviations (mistakes) always require that contradictions be resolved quickly and
creatively (TRIZ can help here).</p>
<p>The main mistakes are usually associated with the underestimation and
insufficient utilization of creativity and intelligence, and the inability to
solve problems requiring creative solutions without increasing the cost and
complexity of the technology. In particular:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Failure to understand the systemic nature of evolution, interconnections
    between useful and harmful factors, and attempts to work on separate
    elements without considering systemic effects</li>
  <li>Failure to understand the essence and role of contradictions; attempts to
    improve one feature without considering the features that will deteriorate
    as a result</li>
  <li>Attempts to capitalize on resources that are obviously limited,
    insufficient utilization of resources that are not obvious, failure to
    understand the possibility of resource transformation and of involving new
    resources from other areas (knowledge and technology transfer).</li>
</ul>
<p>During Stage 1, when the business or core technology was relatively small in
size, all necessary creative solutions were usually found by the creative
leader. When the business grows, however, one individual cannot cover
everything, yet people still expect this. Besides, an authoritarian leader often
does not welcome the ideas of others. The result - the right solutions might be
too late.</p>
<p>Specific typical mistakes are:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Too novel, that is, too many new (and sometimes not properly tested) ideas
    implemented in the technology that make it difficult to achieve an
    acceptable level of reliability, safety, etc. Besides, in most situations,
    customers cannot psychologically digest products or services that are too
    radically new.</li>
  <li>Lack of new attractive features; implementation of small improvements
    without proper differentiation from existing products and services</li>
  <li>“Perfectionism” - that is, endless attempts to improve the system,
    failure to “freeze” development and focus on production and sales</li>
  <li>Premature release of technology with a high level of harmful effects
    (insufficient reliability, complex and expensive maintenance, etc.)</li>
  <font color="#000000">
  <li>Attempts to imitate “mature” systems (systems in the second and third
    stages) and premature complication of the system before it is refined to its
    simplest variant.</li>
  </font>
  <li>The technology seems too simple and does not meet customer expectations of
    a “serious” product/service</li>
  <li>Utilization of elements (materials, assemblies, technologies) that are
    satisfactory at this stage but do not have the resources for further
    development (or that would prevent mass production)</li>
  <font color="#000000">
  <li>Attempts to immediately start with mass production that requires
    substantial investment that can be justified if mass demand is in place</li>
  <li>Attempts to implement the system without providing the proper conditions,
    such as complementary systems and other systems in conjunction with the
    system</li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<ol type="A" start="2">
  <li>Typical mistakes in internal management:</li>
</ol>
<p>The main mistakes are usually associated with a loss of control or with
excessive control in an organization that still requires creativity (and people
who are free to create). The main reason for mistakes is the failure to
understand the transitional processes and problems associated with
organizational changes. Basic mistakes are usually associated with inadequate
(or wrong) leadership, in particular:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>A leader from Stage 1 (the founder, for example) manages the transition to
    Stage 2. In this case the danger is that s/he may lack knowledge and/or
    experience in business and management; s/he relies too much on intuition and
    personal connections, hates “bureaucracy,” is accustomed to making
    voluntary decisions, etc.</li>
  <li>A typical administrator is hired who does not understand and does not
    accept the informalities of Stage 1; and who prefers an administrative style
    when it is unnecessary; who brings in his/her own team (who often conflicts
    with the people from Stage 1).</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific mistakes are:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Lack of planing and administration</li>
  <li>Attempts by people from the past (Stage 1) to fight against necessary
    changes</li>
  <li>Premature introduction of a complex hierarchy, creating a bureaucracy that
    will later try to take over the business</li>
  <li>Generating organized resistance. Unavoidable conflicts inherent to the
    process of radical change force the leader to make decisions that usually
    cause unhappy members of the group to organize. These sporadic groups try to
    maintain their existence (homeostatic effect), become self-sustainable, and
    become capable of supporting and escalating conflicts. In this case, even if
    the original conflict was resolved long ago, the “rebel” group will
    continue to interfere with management and originate new conflicts.</li>
  <li>Establishing permanent structures to fight negative effects. Fighting for
    their homeostasis (survival) they might try to extend the existence of
    negative effects to justify their unlimited activities.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="A" start="3">
  <li>Typical mistakes in external management</li>
</ol>
<p>These are usually the most dangerous mistakes as they can seriously
jeopardize the reputation of the new business in the eyes of the customers,
financial investors, the government, public, etc. The main reasons for these
mistakes might be lack of marketing experience, failure to understand the
details of the new business, and failure to understand its most attractive
features and real value.</p>
<p>The specific mistakes are:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dilettantism, that is, lack of understanding (or hating the idea) that
  marketing and sales require professional knowledge and experience. Attempts to
  judge the product or a service based on common sense or personal preferences</p>
</blockquote>
</p><ol>
  <li>Failure to listen to the voice of the customer. Attempts to dictate to
    customers what they should do and like; excessive aggressiveness in
    approaching potential customers; overconfidence that the value of the new
    product or service is obvious</li>
  <li>Groundless trust that the customer always knows better what he/she needs
    (this is especially wrong when trying to promote a “pioneer” product)</li>
  <li>Choosing the wrong market sector, misinterpreting customer expectations</li>
  <li>Attempts to sell raw technology; overselling</li>
  <li>Premature focus on a variant that has been selected without proper
    research of the market needs and expectations</li>
  <li>Luck of focus</li>
  <li>Attempts to sell without proper support and packaging</li>
  <li>Attempts to seek financing from powerful (and conservative) organizations
    that would be reluctant to take risk or to be involved in a small business</li>
</ol>
<u>
<p>Conclusions</p>
</u>
<p>From the analyses of organizations according to the above approaches we have
developed the following conclusions:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>The analysis of features (see figure) that do not match the organization’s
    position (i.e., that deviate) have revealed three dangerous problems:</li>
</ol>
</p><ul>
  <li>Feature # 12 - Discipline still matches the previous evolutionary stage
    and is one of the factors that systematically disturbs the operation.</li>
  <li>Feature # 35 - The relationship between the Board and the presidential
    structure did not change with the transition to the new stage. The Board
    interferes too much with the operation.</li>
  <li>Feature # 29 - Top management’s style is more suitable for Stage 3 -
    that is, top management does not understand the core technology, prefers to
    play bureaucratic games.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
  <li>The analysis of typical mistakes revealed the following mistakes that must
    be corrected:</li>
</ol>
</p><ul>
  <li>In business or core technology - # 1, 2,4,5,8.</li>
  <li>In internal management - # 2,3,4.</li>
  <li>In external management - # 2,7,8.</li>

</b></i><i><u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Problem Description</p>
</u></i>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i>
    <p>Every broker at the Moscow Commodity Exchange was required to pay a small
    fee for each deal closed on the Exchange</i><sup><a href="#87">87</a></sup><i>.
    In spite of the fact that this fee amounted to a very small percentage of
    the deal, some brokers tried to avoid paying it. In a typical situation one
    broker would hear on the MCE floor about a potential purchase/sale of goods,
    he/she is interested in, then get together with the broker offering these
    goods. According to the MCE rules, after brokers had agreed on a deal they
    were required to register the contract and pay the fee. Instead, however,
    the two brokers would conclude the deal without involving the MCE, and paid
    nothing. The uncollected fees became a problem as they were necessary to
    support the MCE operation. To ensure that this money was collected, several
    methods of controlling the brokers were attempted - these were costly and
    ineffective, however.</p>

  <li><a name="2"></a>Revealed principles and/or patterns were required to meet
    certain criteria, such as be specific and instrumental, that is, clearly
    define actions required to achieve innovations.</li>
  <li><a name="3"></a>A recent experience is the following: Several years ago we
    supplied five students of professor Glenn Mazur of the University of
    Michigan with the Ideator System software for evaluation purposes. In
    exchange we received reports of their work with the software. One student
    reported that he had used the software to successfully resolve a problem
    with his girlfriend.</li>

  <li><a name="11"></a>For a short time, Altshuller received limited support
    from the Soviet Society of Inventors and Innovators.</li>
  <li><a name="12"></a>Altshuller’s stories (published under the pseudonym
    Genrich Altov) became very popular, as did those of his wife, Valentina
    Zhuravlyova. A book of their stories was translated in English and published
    under the title Ballad of the Stars.</li>
  <li><a name="13"></a>Altshuller conducted research in creative inheritance
    produced by a genius artist from Lithuania - K. Churlenis, who was born in
    the early 1900s. Altshuller showed how the artist intuitively used the
    systems approach, ideal vision, resolution of contradictions, and other
    creative approaches.</li>
  <li><a name="14"></a>St. Petersburg Public TRIZ University was founded in 1972
    and has been headed since then by Volyuslav Mitrofanov (for more about
    Mitrofanov, see the section entitled “Solving Scientific Problems”).</li>
  <li><a name="15"></a>Boris Zlotin attended the university in 1974-5, then
    began teaching there the following year. After teaching the CIE course he
    taught a course in the Patterns of Technological Evolution.</li>

  <li><a name="17"></a>Obviously, this was a premature statement. Even today
    there is still a long way to go to convert the art of inventing into a
    science (and we personally doubt the possibility of full conversion. It is,
    however, a great target.)</li>
  <li><a name="18"></a>Together with Pavel Amnuel</li>

    cartoons.</li>
  <li><a name="22"></a>Kirill Sklobovskiy completed a very interesting study on
    the patterns of evolution of the Golden Age of Russian poetry.</li>
  <li><a name="23"></a>According to Altshuller’s definition, a creative
    personality is found in an individual who devotes his life to the invention
    and promotion of something new.</li>

    on these, but was never published.</li>
  <li><a name="32"></a>For more detail, see below.</li>
  <li><a name="33"></a>Upon first examination, this the method is similar to a
    well-known method in the former Soviet Union called “problematic
    education,” in which the teacher helps the student to come to a conclusion
    via a set of guiding questions. This method, however, requires a great deal
    of preliminary work to prepare an adequate set of questions for each topic.
    For our approach, a set of universal guiding questions were developed that
    could be used by teachers of any subject with minimal preparation.</li>

  <li><a name="61"></a>In general, models of these types are understandable to
    people with a contemporary education. Sometimes, however, those whose
    education is based primarily in the liberal arts will reject these modeling
    processes as being too “mechanistic” in nature. We address these
    objections by explaining that it is through just such a mechanistic (i.e.,
    technological) approach that our modern-day world has come into existence,
    and because of its effectiveness we cannot ignore it. One of the 20th
    century’s most interesting scientists, Alexander Bogdanov, remarked: “The
    mechanical side of life is simply that which we have managed to explain. “Mechanism”
    means something that we understand.” We are in full agreement with this
    statement.</li>
  <li><a name="62"></a>We define an organization’s business as its main
    business (for non-commercial organizations, its mission or cause). This can
    be any main activity for which the organization is created - i.e., the “output”
    that justifies the consumption of resources.</li>

  <li><a name="71"></a>A problematic description presents an organization or
    other system as a set of inherent problems that must be solved to improve
    the current situation.</li>
  <li><a name="72"></a>The validity of this assumption is limited (more detail
    later is presented later in this paper).</li>
  <li><a name="73"></a>Some of which can be beneficial to the society, however.</li>
  <li><a name="74"></a>The Communist government was constantly trying to
    convince Soviet citizens that their lives were poor because they did not
    work enough. “Work better and you will live better” was the motto - in
    reality, however, “working better” did not make life better. Instead, it
    led to increased environmental damage and waste of resources. People in the
    USSR felt this intuitively, and thus their work mostly resembled a
    decades-long Italian strike.</li>
  <li><a name="75"></a>The Russian perestroika brought about many sad jokes on
    this subject. In one, a little girl who had learned about Lenin and the
    October Revolution in kindergarten shared her understanding of the situation
    with her parents: “Lenin hated rich people, that is why we are all poor.”</li>

    directly related to a family or to civilization as a whole.</li>
  <li><a name="80"></a>As mentioned earlier, the extended S-curve was presented
    by Zlotin and Zusman at TRIZ seminars held in late 1980s. In 1994 we
    discovered the book Corporate Lifecycles by Ichak Adizes and published in
    the end of 1987. This book contains the best phenomenological description of
    organizational behavior and recommended strategies on each of ten
    well-defined stages. It does not focus on deep mechanisms that determine
    that behavior, however.</li>
