are a concise way of displaying notes and information and their associations. <u>Tony
Buzan</u> developed Mind Maps as an efficient way of using the brain's ability
for association. Association plays a dominant role in nearly every mental
function, and words themselves are no exception. Every single word and idea has
numerous links attaching it to other ideas and concepts.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">To make a MindMap, one starts in the centre of the page and
works outwards in all directions in a tree root like manner to produce an
organised list. The MindMap can be enhanced through the use of images, colour,
outlining / emphasis, shapes, icons, codes, patterns, and links. This large
amount of information together with their associations can stimulate us to
generate new ideas and associations that have not previously been thought of.
They can also be used to organise and show structure to your notes.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">These attributes make MindMaps an ideal partner when using
TRIZ for problem solving and inventing. MindMaps can be usefully applied at a
number of stages in the problem definition, problem solving and solution
evaluation phases of a problem. We typically use them to help define a problem,
analyse resources and constraints, and then provide a structure during the
brainstorming of problem solutions. A typical application sees MindMaps being
used to record the ideas generated in the brainstorming sessions associated with
exploring a contradiction. Using the main branches to display the idea concept
and the lower branch to show the idea and twigs to show implementation, one can
easily move between the different hierarchical layers of a problem and its
solution possibilities. At the end of a typical session, the MindMap is already
sorted by area or concept, making it easier to produce a list for ranking, as
well as providing a common basis upon which all participants can see how the big
picture is formed from the individual details.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In defining a problem, a MindMap can be used in a similar
fashion by starting at the centre with the super-system and working outwards and
down through to the sub-system level. MindMaps thus help to focus on each part
of the system in turn and allow a problem to be broken down to the root cause.</p>
</font>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There are several software packages &lt;http://www.mindjet.com/&gt;
that can be used to produce MindMaps, but they<font face="Times New Roman"> are
not discussed here as the best MindMaps are produced using large sheets of paper
and pens in the hands of all the participants. Allowing everyone to contribute
to the idea MindMap ensures that nobody feels that their ideas have been lost or
discarded and it encourages a structured organisation of the ideas. Because each
item on the MindMap can become the centre of a new MindMap, you do not run out
of paper, but just start a fresh MindMap.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">Although TRIZ offers good methods for solving problems and
developing products and ideas, it does not suggest ways of displaying and
enhancing the search for solutions and new ideas. This does not mean that we
shouldn’t use the method. It does mean that use of TRIZ can be greatly
enhanced through integration with thinking frameworks which are aligned with the
ways in which the human brain functions.</p>
</font>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Tony Buzan developed MindMaps™ as a concise way of
displaying notes, information and their association(s).<font face="Times New Roman">
MindMaps have been used to help organise lists, agendas and ‘brainstorming’
sessions since the 1980’s. Not only can we use a MindMap to help us when using
TRIZ principles, but we can also use a MindMap to represent how we might use
TRIZ. Figure 1 shows a MindMap created from the way TRIZ is depicted in the
Step-by-Step TRIZ book (Reference 3). A MindMap tends to be personal to the
person or group who developed it, so the MindMap that another individual might
develop is likely to be similar but not identical.</p>

</font><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Figure 1: Summary of TRIZ -
&quot;Step by Step TRIZ&quot;</p>
</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">To make a MindMap, one starts in the centre of the page by
stating the overall (or supersystem) concept or idea or stated task. Working
outwards in all directions in a tree like manner first the concepts or
principles are added as branches. Then continuing outwards to the ideas are
added to form the ‘leaves’ of the tree giving an organised list. Arrows can
be added to show association together with shapes and patterns to help with
memorising and association. The MindMap can be enhanced through the use of
images, colour, outlining / emphasis, shapes, icons, codes, patterns, and links.
This large amount of information together with their associations can stimulate
us to generate new ideas and associations that have not previously been thought
of. They can also be used to organise and show structure to your notes. It is
possible to add an idea as a ‘leaf’ without having a concept to hang it onto
- you can go back later when the ideas have dried up to work that out.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Because association plays a dominant role in nearly every
mental function, and words themselves are no exception, the MindMap arrangement
helps our brain make those links.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Each item on the MindMap can become the centre of a new
MindMap, just take a fresh piece of paper and place the concept or idea you want
to expand in the centre.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For clarity in this document I have used electronic versions
of the MindMaps that were generated, though normally in a face-to-face session
these would be drawn on large pieces of paper, with each person having a pen to
add their input. Some software permits virtual MindMaps to be generated by
remote groups of people. The software used to generate these MindMaps was MindM</font>anager
3.5 from M-Urge (in the UK) or Mindjet (in the USA) &lt;http://www.mindjet.com&gt;.</p>
<b><font size="2">
<p>TRIZ and MindMaps</p>
</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">By way of an example, we will use a typical problem that
exists at work - and indeed at many other places I have visited - that of where
to park your car. The UK Government is in the process of passing a variety of
laws to encourage us to use alternative means to get to and from work in order
to reduce the congestion on our roads. One of these, is to place a tax (or
charge) on workplace car parking. You will see that as we progress through the
TRIZ view on the problem and couple this with the reactions of the people this
exercise was done with, it becomes apparent that the Government did not think
through its ideas nor to work out how people would react - perhaps they should
be using TRIZ and MindMaps!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The target was to see whether we could use a small group of
people to come up with viable solutions all within the space of their lunch
break.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The first step (see Figure 1) is to analyse the problem, by
asking the group to record their perception of the problem onto a MindMap. The
group were allowed 5 minutes. At this stage, it is best to try not to suggest
any solutions, though inevitable some will emerge - make sure there is somewhere
to record them.</p>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">

</font><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Figure 2: MindMap of perceived
parking problem</p>
</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">The results show that, fairly naturally, the group
concentrated on the problems they encounter and not on the wider problem of too
many cars for the road structure. Since several suggested solutions emerged from
the problem perception, it seemed worthwhile to spend another couple of minutes
to see if a ‘good’ solution to these emerged without using TRIZ.</p>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
<p align="left"><a href="03.gif" target="_blank"><img src="03_small.gif" border="1" width="100" height="49"></a><br>
</font><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Figure 3: MindMap of solutions
to the parking problem</p>
</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">This started to flush out some of the issues, and lead us to
an Ideal Final Result statement.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The <b>Ideal Final Result</b> (IFR) would leave no vehicles
in the car park, the journey to work would be from home to work (door-to-door),
with your vehicle being the only one on the road, costing nothing, causing no
pollution, at a time of your choosing, with perfect security, travelling time
negligible, and still leave the car available for your spouse to use during the
day.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The feeling was that people would be very happy for everyone
else to go to work by public transport, leaving the roads free for them to go to
work when they wanted with no traffic congestion and for there always to be a
parking space waiting for them. No one wanted to be amongst those ‘inconvenienced’
by having to use another form of transport.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This seemed an appropriate time to evaluate the Government’s
idea that car parking spaces at work should be taxed, and the employee to pay
for the privilege of parking (car or motorbike or pedal cycle). The evaluation
was done using de Bono’s PMI (Plus-Minus-Interesting) tool, but using a
MindMap to display the results. Everyone was given a green pen and asked to
think of positive statements relating to the Governments idea. When this was
exhausted they were given a red pen to think of negative things about the idea.
Finally they were given a blue pen to record interesting thoughts along the
lines: “I wonder if…..”. The PMI was repeated. Solutions (ways of
overcoming the negative points) were recorded that emerged in black on a fourth
branch of the MindMap. The result is shown in Figure 4. This shows that the idea
is likely to generate some income for the Government, plenty of resentment, and
little change in the long term, with very little benefit to the nation or the
environment and only marginal reduction in congestion.</p>

</font><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Figure 4: PMI on introduction of
Government Car Parking space charges</p>
</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">We have defined the problem as we perceive it, stated an IFR,
and recorded our initial solutions and ideas. The problem is clearly not just
the physical problem of a space to park a car, but mainly the social problem of
persuading people to change their ways, and a management problem of controlling
the situation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We have physical contradictions of: wanting a car to get to
work and not wanting a car when we get there (i.e. nothing to park); wanting a
car each, and wanting people to share; wanting no cars on the road when we are
driving, and don’t mind when we’re not driving.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">TRIZ suggests using:</p>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Separation in time<br>
    </b>Dynamics, Partial Action, Preliminary Action, Mechanical Vibration,
    Periodic Action, Beforehand Cushioning, Skipping, Preliminary Anti-action,
    Pneumatics &amp; Hydraulics, Discarding &amp; Recovering</li>
  </font>

  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Transition to Inverse
    system<br>
    </b>Other way around (inversion)</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Splitting the group into two with each selecting two
  principles they thought might produce workable solutions, further ideas were
  recorded on self-sticky paper. In the final few minutes these were added to
  the solutions MindMap generated earlier. The final MindMap is given in Figure
  5.</p>

</font><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Figure 5: Final MindMap of
Parking Solutions</p>
</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">This exercise above serves to show how MindMaps can be used
to help in recording TRIZ sessions.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The car parking problem was run as an exercise and was not
exposed to a rigorous TRIZ study. It does serve to show how the use of MindMaps
can help to record and assist the problem solving process.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We can use MindMaps to present very large quantities of
information in a way which is both compact - as was shown in the ‘one-page’
view of TRIZ illustrated in Figure 1 - and closely allied to the way in which
our brains operate. We can also use MindMaps at a more detailed level to focus
in on a part of the problem - as shown in say Figure 4 - or, as suggested
earlier to provide a structure when using the Contradictions and Inventive
Principles parts of TRIZ. The following MindMaps (Figures 6 to 8), for example,
illustrate the construction of a hierarchy of mind-maps concerning the classic
TRIZ ‘liqueur chocolates’ case study.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The liqueur chocolates scenario, for those unfamiliar with
it, involves a limiting contradiction associated with the manufacture of
chocolate ‘bottles’ filled with a liqueur. The contradiction involves our
desire to improve production rate (‘SPEED’ in terms of the Contradiction
Matrix). To date we have improved speed by increasing the temperature of the
liqueur filling in order to reduce its viscosity and thus improve the rate at
which we can pump it into the chocolate bottles. Now we have increased the
temperature to a point where we are beginning to melt the chocolate.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The first MindMap (Figure 6) illustrates our overall approach
to the problem. Being a limiting contradiction, we have identified
Contradictions, Trends and Knowledge as the three TRIZ tools most likely to help
solve the problem. Used as a foundation, this MindMap serves to prompt us to
ensure that we evaluate all identified solution routes rather than, as is
common, simply applying one technique.</p>

Figure 6: Liqueur Chocolates - Overall Mind Map</p>
</font><font face="Times New Roman"></font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">From this MindMap we proceed to another (Figure 7), which we
have drawn to help us to think about just the </font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">Contradictions</font><font face="Times New Roman">
part of the problem. In the figure, we have identified a number of
contradictions and obtained several Inventive Principle solution triggers. Again
the Map serves as a prompt to ensure we consider all possibilities.</p>
<p align="left"></font><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><a href="07.gif" target="_blank"><img border="1" src="07_small.gif" alt="07.gif (10501 bytes)" width="100" height="31"></a><br>
Figure 7: Liqueur Chocolates - Contradictions Mind Map</p>
</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">The final MindMap (Figure 8) represents one of the Maps drawn
for each of the identified Inventive Principles. In this Map, the Principle is
used as the focus for a systematic brainstorm to connect the Principle to the
problem.</p>
</font><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">

</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">As with the preceding car park example, we would usually take
the Figure 8 output alongside other similar pictures obtained for other
Principles and cascade it upwards to the Figure 7 Map until we have explored all
of the previously identified branches. Similarly we would cascade the completed
Figure 7 Map back up to the Figure 6 Map along with the other Maps constructed
for Trends and Knowledge, until we are able to complete all of the Figure 6
branches.</p>
</font><b><font size="2">
<p>Conclusions</p>
</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p align="JUSTIFY">MindMaps can be used with TRIZ and other tools help generate
further solutions that you would not otherwise have thought about. In do so it
provides a suitable means to record and provide a framework for the ideas and
solutions generated during the working sessions. Using the MindMap to group
concepts and ideas can help to trigger further ideas and solutions.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The car park exercise given above only took a short time to
do (a half hour lunch break), but the layout and number of ideas show what can
be done in a short time compared with other methods. These MindMaps together
with minimal explanation were submitted to our site services department, and
resulted in provision of:</p>
</font>

    includes the local cycle repair shop on its route;</li>
  </font>

  </ul>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Our brains love solutions and are highly prone to diversion
  when someone in a brainstorming session derives a ‘good idea’. This is an
  inevitable part of the problem solving process. The framework offered by
  MindMaps gives us a structured road-map of all the solution routes for a given
  problem, and thus allows us to maintain a systematic problem solving approach
  when we wish to return from the euphoria of one good solution in order to
  continue the search for other - possibly stronger - solutions.</p>
