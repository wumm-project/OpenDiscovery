<h1>Conference Report: Developing Systematic Innovation in the Food Industry</h1>

<p align="left">By: Ellen Domb, <a href="mailto:editor@TRIZ-Journal.com">editor@TRIZ-Journal.com</a></p>
<p>The conference Developing Systematic Innovation in the Food Industry was held
at the University College Cork in Cork, Ireland, November 26-28, 2000. The
conference was organized by Jorge C. Oliveira, with the support of the European
Commission 5th Framework programme (Quality of Life key action). The conference
provides a very useful model for other industries that need to launch innovation
activities across a broad front.</p>
<p>There were over 50 participants from academia, industry, consultancy, and
industrial research and development services, from 18 nations. The first day's
program began with presentations on TRIZ, on analysis of innovative ideas, and
on innovation policy. See Figure 1.</p>

<p>The conferees were then organized into 5 work groups with delegates from each
of the types of organizations in each group, to discuss initiatives for
introducing systematic innovation into the food industry. Topics included the
following:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Development of case studies</li>
  <li>Development of specific examples of each of the tools and techniques for
    various specialties, such as baking, brewing, dairy, etc.</li>
  <li>Training programs for industry</li>
  <li>Curriculum development for universities, both graduate and undergraduate
    levels</li>
  <li>Integration of innovation methods with other tools for understanding
    consumer needs and projecting future consumer needs</li>
</ul>
<p>One TRIZ technique that was used in some of the workshops was to focus on the
contradictions that are found in food technology--how to make food in large
quantities that tastes &quot;home made&quot; or how to have the texture of
high-fat food with the nutritional benefits of low-fat food, etc.</p>
<p>The organizing committee then merged the recommendations of the 5 work groups
and developed common themes for the group to develop further. The discussions
then continued on what work should be done, by what agencies, to make systematic
innovation available to the entire food technology industry.</p>
<p>As a result of this conference, several exciting actions are taking place:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Faculty from some of the universities are introducing TRIZ into their
    courses (in one case during the same week as the conference!)</li>
  <li>Proposals will be developed for several granting agencies to support the
    development of case studies that can be used to demonstrate the application
    of TRIZ to specific food industry issues. This will likely entail a
    combination of training with case study work. Multi-disciplinary teams will
    be formed to develop these cases and document them in forms that will be
    useful for both industrial and university training.</li>
  <li>Proposals will be developed to apply TRIZ (and other complementary tools,
    as needed) to foresight exercises of strategic issues in food innovation and
    consumers</li>
  <li>A small working group will initiate preliminary work on adapting the
    concepts of the 40 inventive principles from a “food” perspective</li>
  <li>A correspondence network will be formed of people interested in systematic
    innovation in food technology, to share information and to do the work of
    developing these industry specific examples of TRIZ applications. Anyone
    interested should contact JorgeOliveira, <a href="mailto:j.oliveira@ucc.ie">j.oliveira@ucc.ie</a></li>
</ol>
<p>This conference is a promising beginning to the propagation of TRIZ and other
ideas throughout the food industry, using the existing mechanisms of the
academic, research, and industrial communities, and is also a model for other
industries. The TRIZ Journal will report on the progress of this work as it
develops.</p>

kisses the stone receives the gift of eloquence. (In the cold rain, the kisser
grabs the poles and leans backwards over a 75-foot drop to kiss the stone!)</p>
<p>NOTE: The Book of Proceedings and a Report entitled “A Research Strategy
for Developing Systematic Innovation Tools in the Food Industry” will be
prepared and made freely available. They should be ready by February in hard
copy and a month or so later on the website of UCC, Faculty of Food Science
&amp;Technology. Jorge Olveira, <u><font color="#0000ff">j.oliveira@ucc.ie</font></u>
will be happy to receive expressions of interest on such documents, to build a
contact list for when they’re ready.</p>
