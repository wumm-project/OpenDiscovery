<p>As has been pointed out before, TRIZ as a problem solving methodology is
seldom practiced in a vacuum. It is frequently incorporated into a broader
corporate innovation program or as a problem-solving tool coupled with a problem
identification tool such as Six Sigma or QFD. To adopt TRIZ into the existing
corporate problem solving and innovation structure, its tools and components
must be integrated to make maximum use of its capabilities and potential. A
frequently overlooked point is that TRIZ problem solving is also done by
different people with varying social and problem solving styles. In previous
TRIZ Journal articles (3,4), Steve Ungvari has discussed the use of
Organizational Engineering assessment tools to align the use of various TRIZ
tools with the particular strengths of the problem solving team. In a parallel
TRIZ Journal article in this issue, Darrell Mann summarizes the DeBono Six Hats™
thinking tool and how it might be used in conjunction with TRIZ problem solving.
In this process, all participants take defined thinking roles at various times
during a meeting or problem solving session to avoid polarization, and to insure
the group is focused in the right areas at the right time. This paper will
summarize another very powerful and well-validated tool that has been
successfully used within TRIZ problem solving sessions.</p>
<p>Michael Kirton, a renowned British industrial psychologist, has developed an
instrument known as the KAI (Kirton Adoptive Innovative) which measures the
style of individual problem solving. For details on the method, please refer to
the references (1,2) at the end of the paper. Style, in this case, refers to an
adoptive, building, or analogic problem solving style vs. an innovative or
pioneering style. Both skills are needed in organizational problem solving, but
the differences are not often recognized nor measured. Characteristics of “builder/adapters”
and “innovators/pioneers” are shown in Table 1. Table 2 illustrates how each
is viewed by their opposites.</p>

<p>A simple 33-item questionnaire is used to measure an individual’s problem
solving style on a scale from 60-160 and is typically done by problem-solving
participants at least 2 weeks prior to the TRIZ session. This assessment tool
can be completed in about 15 minutes. A person with a building/adoptive style
will score in the range of 60-90 while a person with a pioneering/innovative
style will score between 110 and 140. Those with scores in between are
frequently bridges within groups or teams and have some of the qualities of both
extremes. This assessment tool is extremely accurate and has been globally
validated across many cultures over decades. Along with the score itself, the
individual is provided with customized feedback materials to help them
understand their problem solving style vs. that of others. The use and
distribution of the KAI assessment tools is overseen and controlled by the KAI
Center at the Hatfield Polytechnic Institute in England, with U.S. training and
certification handled by the Blumberg Center at Indiana State University in
Terre Haute, IN.</p>
<p>How is this used within the context of TRIZ problem solving? First of all,
TRIZ itself is a significantly different way of problem solving and thinking for
most individuals. It is a far more structured and time-consuming tool than
conventional brainstorming or some of the other random stimuli tools used. This
is frustrating to those who are used to moving immediately into the solution
space of a problem solving exercise. On the other hand, it provides stimulus to
those who need it in their problem solving efforts. Thus, it provides what both
extremes of the KAI problem-solving continuum require. The up-front
problem-definition provided by such tools as the Innovation Situation
Questionnaire™ and the Problem Formulator™ provide structure to the problem
solving that pioneers and innovators need to focus their creative energies. The
stimulus provided by problem solving operators and picture examples of
previously solved problems provides the needed stimulus needed by analogic/builder
thinkers.</p>
<p>When KAI is integrated into a TRIZ session, it can be done in a number of
ways. First, a 1-2 hour session, usually over lunchtime in the middle of a
multi-day session, provides an overview of the principles of KAI and the
assessment tool. Individual assessments are passed out and team members are free
to discuss their scores and reaction to them. Another interesting way to provide
group learning is to separate groups of people according to KAI scores (prior to
their disclosure to the individuals) and demonstrate the difference in how
people at opposite ends of the spectrum approach problem definition using a tool
such as the IWB™ Problem Formulator™. One finds that a group of
builder/adopters will develop a very structured diagram (see Figure 1) while a
group of innovator/pioneers will develop a very disorganized graph (see Figure
2) that, while is perfectly understandable to them, is not easily understood by
builder/adopters.</p>
<p>Showing these various graphs to each other provides a great deal of learning
regarding how different people approach problems differently. Combining the two
styles usually provides the best of both worlds. The recognition of the
differences within groups is absolutely critical to effective team problem
solving. It is also possible to match the use of TRIZ tools, as Steve Ungvari
has suggested, with KAI profiles as has been done with OE assessment tools. One
would expect pioneers/innovative KAI scoring individuals to respond better to
software and example stimuli, while builders/adapters would prefer Su-Filed
modeling and the use of the Problem Formulator™.</p>
<p>We are just at the beginning of learning how TRIZ and KAI can be combined to
increase the impact and learning from a TRIZ session. Additional group studies
over the next year or so will be shared with the TRIZ community to the greatest
extent possible.</p>
<p>One possible outcome of the various studies which have been done, as well as
those in progress, would be “knowledge base” of joint application methods as
a function of (1) the type of problem being solved and (2) the type of people
solving the problem.</p>
