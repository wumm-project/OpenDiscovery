<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
</b>
<p>One of the great strengths of TRIZ relative to other creativity methodologies
is that it is built on solid technical rather than psychological foundations.
That being said, the power of TRIZ can be shown to be enhanced greatly by
appropriate combination with the best of the methods developed by
psychology-based researchers. Edward De Bono’s ‘Six Thinking Hats’ concept
(Reference 1) is one area where a great deal of synergy exists with TRIZ. The
paper describes how the Six Thinking Hats concept has been integrated into a
generic TRIZ-based problem definition and solving procedure.</p>
<p>The Six Thinking Hats concept is built on the fact that the human brain works
in different modes depending on the sort of task it is being asked to perform.
Thus, to take two extremes, the mechanisms used by the brain when generating new
ideas is significantly different to those present when we are calculating the
pros and cons of an existing idea. In all, De Bono has identified six different
modes of thought which are relevant across the range of actions taking place
during the problem solving process (Figure 1). Each mode has been identified by
a different coloured hat, such that:-</p>

</b><font face="Arial" color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">The article describes how the Hats concept might be
integrated into a TRIZ problem solving scheme (Reference 2) covering the
complete spectrum of activities - from initial situation assessment, to problem
definition, to problem solution - present in a facilitated inventive problem
solving session. Thus, for example we see the conducting of a function analysis
conducted in two parts - the first, looking at the positive functional
relationships in a system, operating in ‘White Hat’ mode, followed by a
second ‘Black Hat’ mode in which the negative relationships in the system
are systematically analysed. Similarly the value of switching between White and
Green Hat modes when using the Contradictions parts of the TRIZ tool-kit is
detailed.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We begin the article, however, with an examination of
the different Hat modes, and the times we might chose to wear them when using
different elements of the TRIZ toolkit:</font></p>
<b><font face="Arial"></font>
<p>White Hat</p>
</b>
<p>We wear the white hat when we are seeking to take a non-emotional, objective
look at data and information. We are most likely to require use of White Hat
thinking strategies at the following points during use of the TRIZ problem
definition and problem solving process:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>During the initial problem assessment and definition phase. Specifically,
    when conducting the first stages of a function analysis - in which we are
    seeking to describe the actual functioning of the existing system - but also
    when examining statements describing the desired end point for the problem,
    and understanding the present level of maturity of the system in terms of it
    (and its sub-systems’) position on their respective evolutionary S-curves.</li>
  <li>During the phase in which, having completed an initial problem definition,
    the problem owner is looking to select the most appropriate of the TRIZ
    problem solving tools.</li>
  <li>Defining the Ideal Final Result, and using the Ideality problem solving
    tool concept of working back from this IFR to a physically realisable
    solution.</li>
  <li>When defining contradictions, and when using the Contradiction Matrix or
    the Physical Contradiction solution method tools.</li>
  <li>When using a functional knowledge-base.</li>
  <li>When recording generated solutions.</li>
  <li>When assessing and ranking the quality of solutions during the down-select
    part of the overall process.</li>
  <li>In conjunction with the 9 Windows tool, throughout the overall problem
    definition and solving process in order to ensure that space and time
    dimensions are given appropriate attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>As TRIZ has been configured as a ‘systematic’ creativity tool, it should
not come as a great surprise to learn that the White Hat is worn most during a
TRIZ session. The other 5 Hats, however, are still vital at certain points
during the process:</p>
<font face="Arial"></font><b>
<p>Red Hat</p>
</b>
<p>The red hat is worn when we are using our intuition and relying on our
feelings and emotions (frequently referred to as “gut feel”). The red hat
mode of thinking may at first sight appear to be the complete antithesis of a
systematic creativity process, but it has its uses, and - most importantly - we
need to recognise that the way our brains operate means that many of us spend a
large proportion of our time naturally thinking in a Red Hat mode. At the very
least, therefore, we need to be aware of Red Hat thinking modes, if only to
recognise that we need to step out of it for much of the time. We are most
likely to wish to use Red Hat thinking strategies positively, though, at the
following points during the TRIZ problem definition and problem solving process:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Almost inevitably given the way our brains are wired and the way we have
    been thought to problem solve traditionally, when given a problem we shift
    immediately into Red Hat ‘problem solving’ mode. We should recognise
    this phenomenon and try to use it to positive effect. It is common,
    therefore, to include a five or ten minute period either right at the
    beginning of a session, or immediately after the initial problem definition
    phase, of brainstorming. The output from such a brainstorming session is
    commonly recorded and placed in a ‘car-park’ where all participants can
    see that their input has been registered and will be returned to at the
    appropriate time during subsequent parts of the process.</li>
  <li>Red Hat thinking mode can also be useful as a psychological
    inertia-breaking tool if use of the TRIZ problem solving tools has not
    produced any viable solutions.</li>
  <li>Red Hat thinking mode can also be used to good effect at times during a
    problem solving session to break out of the rut that can sometimes occur if
    participants have been kept in other thinking modes - but particularly White
    Hat - for extended periods. Provocations like ‘spend five minutes thinking
    about the worst possible means of solving the problem’ have not uncommonly
    generated some interesting and subsequently viable solution options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, these points aside, Red Hat thinking mode should be deployed
only sparingly when using TRIZ methods.</p>
<b>
<p>Black Hat</p>
</b>
<p>We wear the black hat when we employ caution and judgement, and looking
logically at the negative aspects of a given situation. We are most likely to
require use of Black Hat thinking modes at the following points during the TRIZ
problem definition and problem solving process:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>During the initial problem definition phase, where we are attempting to
    identify all of the constraints that exist in and around our problem.</li>
  <li>During the conducting of a function/attribute analysis of the problem
    situation, when we are looking to identify the harmful, insufficient and
    excessive functions that exist in the current system. (NB it is very
    important to recognise that Black Hat thinking and White Hat thinking are
    two significantly different modes, and that a proper function analysis
    requires both. The most effective function analysis sessions occur when the
    White Hat and the Black Hat modes are conducted sequentially, with White Hat
    first, and Black Hat being allowed to commence only after a specific
    instruction from a problem facilitator that modes should now be shifted.)</li>
  <li>During a ‘how can I destroy this system?’ subversion analysis.</li>
  <li>During assessment of solution options when trying to gauge the relative
    weaknesses of the solutions under consideration.</li>
  <li>When answering the question ‘is the chosen solution good enough?’ at
    the end of a session. Another common human trait is that we are highly
    inclined towards accepting and settling on a solution that we think is
    novel. This is particularly evident when we have successfully broken a
    contradiction. An excellent example of the need to put on a Black Hat at the
    ‘end’ of a problem solving session comes from the bifurcated bicycle
    seat design previously described in Reference 3 - here the idea of
    bifurcation successfully eliminated the ‘I want the saddle to be wide AND
    narrow’ contradiction, and the company decided that this alone was a good
    enough solution. If they had put on their Black Hats at this stage, they
    might have forced themselves to recognise that the bifurcated seat had
    generated a number of new problems which, in retrospect, if they had solved
    before trying to launch the new product, they might have had a runaway
    success as opposed to the largely failed design they currently try to sell.</li>
</ul>
<b>
<p>Yellow Hat</p>
</b>
<p>We wear the yellow hat when we are examining the feasibility and benefits of
a potential solution, or are seeking to logically assess the positive aspects of
a given situation. We are most likely to require use of Yellow Hat thinking
strategies at the following points during use of the TRIZ problem definition and
problem solving process:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>During the initial definition stage of a problem when we are examining the
    resources that exist in and around the current system.</li>
  <li>During assessment of solution options when trying to gauge the relative
    strengths of the solutions under consideration.</li>
  <li>When seeking to challenge the validity of the initially defined problem
    constraints.</li>
  <li>When using the Trimming part of the TRIZ toolkit - particularly when
    asking the questions ‘do I need this function?’ or ‘can an existing
    part of the system perform the function for me?’ or ‘can a resource
    perform the function?’ (NB some users find that Trimming works more
    successfully in White Hat mode; the author has generally had more success
    getting groups to wear a Yellow Hat.)</li>
  <li>When using the Standard Inventive Solutions, and trying to relate them to
    the problem situation. Solution triggers like ‘add a substance’ can be a
    little too obtuse for some people; this is less of a problem if such people
    are specifically asked to be in Yellow Hat mode.</li>
</ul>
<b>
<p>Green Hat</p>
</b>
<p>We wear the green hat when we are looking to generate new ideas or are
seeking to ‘be creative’. We are most likely to require use of Green Hat
thinking strategies at the following points during use of the TRIZ problem
definition and problem solving process:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>During the initial definition stage, a short period of Green Hat thinking
    immediately after the Yellow Hat search for resources often sees the
    realisation of a considerable number of additional ideas that did not arise
    previously. (NB the preceding Yellow Hat mode is important and should not be
    replaced by Green.)</li>
  <li>During any point when using the TRIZ problem solving tools when we are
    seeking to translate generic solution triggers - e.g. Inventive Principles,
    Trends of evolution, translation of conceptual solutions from the Ideality
    tool, use of Smart Little People, Size-Time-Cost, etc - into specific
    solutions. The importance of Green Hat thinking here cannot be
    over-estimated. It is a topic we will return to in a future article
    (Reference 4).</li>
</ul>
<b>
<p>Blue Hat</p>
</b>
<p>We wear the blue hat when looking to provide a controlling function, or when
organising the overall thinking process. The Blue Hat is the hat that we wear
when judging when and where to put on the other Hats. The Blue Hat is the
overall process organising Hat. It is the one worn almost continuously by the
facilitator of a problem solving session rather than specifically by all members
of a problem solving team. That being said, there are times when the team may
benefit through collective donning of the Blue Hat:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>During post-session recording of events.</li>
  <li>Periodically during subversion analysis when trying to ensure that all
    failure modes are being adequately traced and recorded.</li>
  <li>When a problem solving team is getting bogged down in the detail of a
    particular part of a process, it is often useful for the facilitator to get
    the rest of the team to shift into Blue Hat thinking mode in order to zoom
    out of the details and to re-datum or re-orient themselves to see where they
    are in the overall process.</li>
</ul>
<b>
<p>Putting It All Together</p>
</b>
<p>There is no one definitive version of a ‘TRIZ process’. In many senses,
such a thing can only exist in the mind of an individual. With this in mind,
this article does not in any way seek to propose an all-encompassing ‘TRIZ
process’. On the other hand, in order to examine how a ‘typical’ problem
definition and solving session might require us to shift from one Hat to
another, a number of generic steps are present in the vast majority of
situations. These generic steps will be described below alongside a description
of how we might shift from one Hat to another as we progress through the steps.</p>
<p>At the very broadest level we might see the systematic creativity process as
consisting of four major steps - starting with Problem <b>Definition</b>, then <b>Select</b>ing
the most appropriate solution routes, then generating <b>Solution</b>s, and
finally <b>Evaluat</b>ing and down-selecting. We might see these steps as a
looping process which repeats until we obtain a solution with which we are happy

</ul>
<p>EVALUATE</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Have solutions been generated? If no, then the problem needs to be re-cast
    (<b><font color="#C0C0C0"><span style="background-color: #000000">Black</span></font></b>
    Hat, possibly followed by <b>Red</b>, <b>Green</b>, or maybe <b><font color="#C0C0C0"><span style="background-color: #0000FF">Blue</span></font></b><font color="#000000">,</font><b><font color="#0000ff">
    </font></b><font color="#000000">probably in that order)</font></li>
  <li>If yes, then solutions need to be ranked (<b><font color="#000000"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Yellow</span></font></b>
    Hat, systematically followed by <b><font color="#C0C0C0"><span style="background-color: #000000">Black</span></font></b>
    Hat)</li>
  <li>Deciding where to go next (i.e. around the loop again or to finish) (<b>White</b>
    Hat, but the facilitator should definitely encourage participants to go into
    <b><font color="#C0C0C0"><span style="background-color: #000000">Black</span></font></b>
    Hat mode one more time if possible)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the above does not claim to be in any way definitive, rather that
it should be judged as a measure of the need for us to shift our mode of
thinking both systematically and regularly during a problem session.</p>
<font face="Arial"></font><b>
<p>Six Thinking Hats and TRIZ-based Software</p>
</b>
<p>Some parts of the TRIZ community are strong advocates of TRIZ-based software.
While being a frequent user of certain aspects of such software, this author
believes that until such times as the software is able to take due account of
the different modes of operation found in the human brain, it cannot hope to
provide us with anything like a comprehensive problem definition and solving
capability. Software tools currently claiming such a capability should be
treated with a fair degree of (Black Hat) scepticism.</p>
<font face="Arial"></font><b>
<p>Conclusions</p>
</b>
<p>Successful use of TRIZ tools demands that we recognise that the human brain
works in distinctly different modes. Edward DeBono’s Six Thinking Hats show us
the six main modes of operation. We need to ensure that we are aware of the
different modes, and, as much as possible, make sure that we match the
appropriate Hat to the appropriate parts of the overall process.</p>
