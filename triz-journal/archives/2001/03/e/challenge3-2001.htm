<p align="left"><b>TRIZ Challenge</b></p>
<p>We challenge you to use your TRIZ skills and your knowledge to help solve a
humanitarian or social problem. We hope that you will submit your results for
publication in the TRIZ journal. Every few months we will set a new challenge -
but that does not mean that you cannot continue to work on previous challenges,
indeed you may have chosen to work on this for your project or coursework.</p>
<p>Send your results, ideas, comments and suggestions for future challenges to <a href="mailto:challenge@triz-journal.com">challenge@triz-journal.com</a></p>

<p><b>This month's challenge is on Landmines.</b></p>
<p>Landmines cost less than $3 each, the new ones are predominately plastic. The
automatic removal machines are only suitable for certain terrain and are
expensive. Even using relatively cheap labour (e.g. in Africa) the cost of
clearing one mine is around $300 (i.e. around 100 times it's cost). The real
problem is not finding mines. We can already do that quite well with metal
detectors, ground radar, EM (Electro Magnetic) probes and manual prodders.
Despite this the vast bulk of the £600 million or so that has been spent on
&quot;Humanitarian Demining Research&quot; has been spent on this already solved
problem, and so far has failed to produce any new tools for local deminers in
the poor countries.</p>
<p>The real problems are in such areas as: how to clear vegetation that may
contain trip-wire mines; how to reliably survey the extent of mined areas which
may be contaminated by UneXploded Ordinance (UXO) or caches of arms and not
mines as such; and then how to mark them permanently in countries so poor that
even painted rocks are likely to be taken because people have another use for
them.</p>
<p>Unlike military demining, humanitarian demining is not essentially about
finding mines, it is the process of being able to declare land entirely free
from all explosive debris; i.e. it is about finding land where there are no
mines. Frequently this does not involve any mines, it is simply making sure that
a possibly mined area is not actually mined, a process sometimes called Area
Reduction. Sniffing technologies are one of the most promising ways of doing
this though as yet the only sniffers used in the field are dogs. There are a
number of companies pursuing different routes to get the sensitivity high enough
to be able to confidently declare an absence of mines.</p>
<p>So the challenges are: How do we mark an area that is known to be mined, or
is munitions free in poor countries? How do we give poor people in poor
countries the means to clear land to make it habitable and cultivatable?</p>

<p>The following websites of two of the leading demining NGOs (Non Governmental
Organisations) have useful information and more if you follow the links they
list:</p>
