<p>Those who have read my other TRIZ articles, on “TRIZ and How to Stop
Tornadoes”, and “TRIZ and decorating”, know that I like to be playful with
TRIZ but to tackle at times some serious issues.</p>
<p>I am not quite sure where an anti-gravity machine is in this. It seemed like
such a crazy notion that certainly, initially, I think I was simply being
playful. No harm in that. At present it has more potential in a science fiction
novel, and maybe the idea has been written there already.But as the ideas
emerged I began to wonder, if not now, is there something of potential here? For
some time in the future? Well, I leave you to judge the feasibility of the
concepts.</p>
<p>I have often heard people say that TRIZ is useful for things we know in the
Newtonian world of physics, but maybe there could be a new TRIZ which looks at
the quantum world with some possible new tools? Certainly some Contradictions
seem solvable in new ways (being in two places at once for example!)<font SIZE="2">.</p>

<p>As always, the value of the article is in the illustration of using TRIZ for
a variety of different kinds of situations. If someone has used TRIZ and arrived
at the same anti-gravity machine then I apologise!</p>
<b>
<p>Background</p>
</b>
<p>Well, you are probably all aware that the quantum world is very strange and
complex. It seems there are four different types of force, though when someone
eventually discovers the unifying physics of the future all the four may be seen
to be part of the same force, operating differently in different circumstances.</p>
<p>To simplify things (which is always dangerous because the simplification may
be inaccurate) we could say that even in the quantum world things are either
pushed or pulled.</p>
<p>Normally we think of light, or any electromagnetic wave/particle, as pushing.
Light hits you and you can measure the push from the hit. But the quantum
physicists suggest that when we have a pulling action from electromagnetic
bonding there is a pulling from an exchange of particles, and this pulling is
with an exchange of photons.</p>
<p>Gravity we normally think of as pulling, though there are occasional
suggestions that in certain circumstances it might do some pushing (New
Scientist 7<sup>th </sup>July 2001, page 7). Gravity occurs, it is suggested,
when there is an exchange of gravitons. If all forces are part of the same
unified force of nature, then we might want to be playful using TRIZ to create
an anti-gravity machine, extending what we can do with light to what we might be
able to do with gravity?</p>
<p>So, if we have two objects, and passing between them some basic wave
/particles, we can ask simple TRIZ questions of how do we change the interaction
between the two bodies so that the effects from one to the other are different?</p>
<p>We can use the TRIZ Principle of Mediator, number 24.</p>
<p>With light we know that we can bounce light off a surface, we can bend light
through an object or at the edge of a surface, and we can slow it down by
passing it through material. So we can alter the parameters of speed, direction
and location.</p>
<p>We know many ways of changing direction, and thus location, but we do not
have much control over speed, mostly light continues to travel very fast. But
there are people playing with very cold materials who have succeeded in slowing
light down to just a few metres per second (see Light Years by Brian Clegg,
Piatkus, 2001).</p>
<p>Our function map of the relationship between two bodies suggests that the
problem we have with gravity is that there is a pull between the two bodies
which is too uniform in time. Because it is too uniform I cannot manipulate
actions so that the effect is less when I want it to be and more when I want it
to be. So the playful TRIZ Principles I could use are not easily available to me
simply because I have too uniform an action between the two objects.</p>
<p>Identifying this as the true problem I can now ask myself if I can move
laterally from the world of light to the world of gravity. What if I could slow
down the gravity waves by placing an intermediate object which slows down the
passage of the gravity wave? And if I was to have a segmented system where I
continually varied the intervention of materials between the two objects then I
might, by spinning many plates underneath a plane, for example, have even more
reduction in the action of the gravity wave particle exchange?</p>
<b>
<p>Anti gravity machines and flying</p>
</b>
<p>So now I am imagining and system underneath an aeroplane. As intervening
plates are spun very fast underneath the plane the gravitons (as exchange
particles,) are slowed sufficiently as they pass through the material that they
emerge outside of the interaction with the plane - they miss the plane!</p>
<p>This might seem very odd, and seem to be breaking some very fundamental laws
of physics, and someone may need to do the quantum mathematics to verify what
might happen in the interactions if we did manage to slow the graviton speed
down to just a few metres per second.</p>
<p>But even if the plane still was going to be hit by the gravitons, maybe it
would be possible to use TRIZ Principle for Coordinating the rhythmic action
between the lift on the plane and the pull of gravity?</p>
<b>
<p>Summary</p>
</b>
<p>As stated in the beginning of this article, this was an initial attempt at
being playful which then turned into a maybe. I suggest it only as a maybe. Lots
of unknowns here and some more iterations before moving on or rejecting the
idea. But when we occasionally take what seems a crazy notion and then find some
way of even vaguely making it possible, it should remind us to be very humble
indeed before rejecting any ideas as impossible!</p>
<p>I look forward to any thoughts you have on this. (Respond to Graham Rawlinson
