<p>Abstract</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times" COLOR="#000000">
<p>We all believe that TRIZ is a powerful tool. But how should it be used?</p>
<p>TRIZ can make a critical difference in the development of new devices.
However, there are two problems that commonly crop up:</p>
<blockquote>
</font><font FACE="Times">
<p>1) We try to make TRIZ a silver bullet</p>
<p>2) TRIZ is not always applied to the activities for which it has high
leverage</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us tackle the second problem first. Yes, TRIZ can be very helpful in
solving problems on the production line. But is that the best time to apply it?
The application of TRIZ on the production line makes TRIZ a part of the
problem-reaction approach. Problem reaction is an outmoded approach that we
should minimize. The productive trend of the last 20 years has been to migrate
from problem reaction to problem prevention. We want to include TRIZ in the
vanguard of the problem-prevention approach. The main role for TRIZ is in the
development of new technology.</p>
<p>Now to the first problem. TRIZ is very powerful, but many other activities
have to be done very well also. Other tools that we want to combine with TRIZ
are QFD, functional analysis, reusability planning, object-oriented approach,
Pugh concept evolution and selection, parameter design and tolerance design
(Taguchi Methods), design inspections, and robust testing. One-dimensional
improvements always fall far short. The complete set of balanced tools is needed
for success.</p>
<p>We do Technology Development in four phases: (1) Technology Strategy, (2)
Concept Generation and Selection, (3) Robust Design, and (4) Selection and
Transfer. TRIZ is a powerful tool for technology strategy and concept
generation. Technology Development is the critical application for TRIZ. It is
the natural time for the invention of new concepts for performing functions.
When TRIZ is combined with other tools, especially robust design, then a flow of
successful new technologies can be expected.</p>

<p>introduction</p>
<p>TRIZ Status</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>In the early 1990s TRIZ started to emerge from the former USSR. Initially
there was much hype, but little content. Now thanks to organizations such as the
Altshuller Institute the content matches the hype.</p>
<p>So now we all accept that TRIZ has great and unique capabilities. This
conference has reports of many great successes. However, TRIZ has had little
impact in the countries with advanced economies.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Why Isn’t TRIZ Used More?</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>TRIZ obviously has tremendous potential to greatly speed up the development
of non-incremental new technologies. What is stopping the widespread use of TRIZ?
Two things:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Lack of integration</p>
  <p>Weak implementation</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Role of TRIZ and its Integration</p>
</blockquote>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>TRIZ has too often been portrayed as a silver bullet that is all that is
needed to bring success. There is not any silver bullet, TRIZ or otherwise. TRIZ
must be used in its most productive roles, and it must be integrated into a
productive process. TRIZ must be surrounded by other productive process elements
that will work together with TRIZ to achieve success. This integrative framework
will be presented here as Total Technology Development.</p>
<blockquote>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Implementation</p>
</blockquote>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>TRIZ has implicitly been following a nucleation and growth approach to
implementation. Although this approach has a role, by itself it will never
succeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Total Technology Development (TTD)</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>A separation of technology development from product development and its
transfer into a distinct and clearly defined technology stream having clear
interfaces to a distinct product stream as illustrated in Figure 1 has been
proposed by Clausing [1994] and further developed by Schulz [1998].</p>

<p align="left">Figure 1. Separate Product and Technology Stream (adapted from
Clausing [1994])</p>
<p>Technology insertion into product programs as illustrated in Figure 1 (<i>'...fishing
out of new technologies...'</i>) is facilitated whenever new technologies are
ready, that is to say have reached an appropriate level of superiority,
robustness, and maturity. Thus TTD will further enable rapid technology
integration into product programs and reduce the quality, cost and schedule
uncertainty within those programs. Only technologies that are robust and mature
will be transferred into a product program. This greatly improves reliability,
and reduces the problem-solving phase of commercialization.</p>
<p>A reduced technology development cycle time associated with early technology
robustness and maturity makes superior and mature technologies rapidly eligible
for a transfer into product programs. Overcoming the <b>time/maturity gap</b>
within technology development (Figure 2) is key to successful systems
development, because it enables the company to introduce <b>superior
technologies earlier </b>than any competitor. Thus TTD will provide faster and
better technologies to markets.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 2. Speeding up the S curve [Schulz and Clausing, 1998]</p>
<p>TTD is called 'total' because it aims at capturing and incorporating all
critical aspects of technology development by being based on a systems
engineering perspective.</p>
<p>New technologies improve both the product and the production of the product.
We also sometimes speak a little more broadly of new technologies for product
and technology development, such as the content of this paper for example.
However, here we restrict ourselves to the more physical product and process
technologies.</p>
<p>In general different research and development activities cover a very wide
range, from very basic research creating new knowledge or even new areas of
research, to typical product development activities taking merely existing
technologies and rapidly putting the resulting product into the marketplace. For
a better classification of the framework proposed within the context of this
paper, four basic areas of research and development are distinguished and
illustrated in Figure 3.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 3. Four Types of R&amp;D Activities (adapted from
Clausing [1999])</p>
<p>The first two areas of fundamental and applied research aim at generating new
knowledge or new technological capabilities. Technology development aims at
achieving fundamental improvements based on the knowledge or technological
capabilities provided by the first two types of activities. The fourth type,
commercialization, finally aims at transferring the improvements provided by
technology development into the marketplace, and is therefore equivalent to the
type of activity usually called product development.</p>

<p>The viewpoint of Total Technology Development was presented as Chapter 7 of
my book Total Quality Development [Clausing, 1994], and has subsequently been
enlarged in theses that I supervised by Armin Schulz, Michael Frauens, Clemens
Bauer, and Siddhartha Sampathkumar. Schulz further developed the complete scope
of Total Technology Development, and integrated TRIZ into it. Frauens worked on
the technical aspects of technology strategy, with a strong emphasis on TRIZ.
Bauer worked on the complete technology strategy, with an emphasis on real
option theory. Sampathkumar worked on radical or disruptive technologies. The
works of these students will be referred to in this paper simply by their name.
The relevant documents are listed in the References section at the end of this
paper.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 of Clausing [1994] and the further enhancement of Schulz integrated
the following methodologies:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Various Approaches to Technology Strategy (see [Porter, Roper, et al.
  1991], [Lowe, 1995], and [Betz 1987, 1998])</li>

<p>The methods were assigned to the distinct phases of a basic technology
development process proposed by Clausing [1994], which is illustrated in Figure

<p>The Derived Framework</p>
<p>Overview</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>The top-level process consists of four major phases, each containing specific
sub-processes, which are all discussed in detail in Schulz. The four phases of
the top-level process are as follows:</p>
<p>Phase (1) Integrated Technology Strategy<br>
Phase (2) Concept Work<br>
Phase (3) Robustness Development<br>
Phase (4) Technology Selection, Transfer, and Integration</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Phase 1<br>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
Technology strategy is developed to determine which functions we should work
to improve with new technologies. We also define the customer-observable
characteristics that it will be most beneficial to improve. The final result is
funding of the selected projects.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Phase 2<br>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
During <b>concept generation</b> the function to be improved is considered
for alternative means of providing the function that promise to follow the
needed improvement vector. Then during <b>concept evolution and selection</b>
the best concepts are selected for further development.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Phase 3<br>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
The alternative concepts are optimized within <b>robustness development</b>
to achieve robustness, flexibility, and maturity of the new technology before
transferring it into any product program. The robust settings of the most
significant critical parameters are determined, which results in a robust design
of the new technology concepts.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Phase 4<br>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
The alternative technology concepts are evaluated based on the Pugh concept
selection procedure [Pugh, 1996]. Selection criteria are defined based on the
four aspects of winning technologies: superiority, robustness, maturity, and
flexibility. Technologies chosen for a transfer into product development program
are subsequently integrated into their corresponding product program.</p>
<p>TRIZ is applicable to Phases 1 and 2. Therefore, here we will concentrate on
these two phases. (There is research now in progress to also apply TRIZ to
robustness work. It would include conceptual robustness during the concept
work.)</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phase 1 - Integrated technology Strategy</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>Technology strategy determines the most important long-term technological
needs. New technologies are aimed at improving the performance of some function.
Typical types of improvements are (1) functionality, (2) reliability, (3) cost,
and (4) size. Functionality means that the function is being done qualitatively
better - brighter colors for a printer for example. Reliability, cost, and size
are self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Technology strategy decides which functions we will work to improve, and what
our primary approach will be. There are a series of decisions to be made.</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>How interesting is the function to customers?</li>
  <li>Can we improve it very much?</li>
  <li>Can our competitors improve it very much?</li>
</ol>
<p>If the answers to these three questions are negative, we probably do not want
to work to improve the technology.</p>
<p>If the answer to just the first question is that customers do not much notice
the function, then a new technology will not have much financial benefit. As an
example let us consider the paper feeder for a printer. A paper feeder cannot
add to the customers’ perception of the functionality of the printer. It could
detract from it by damaging the paper, but this is not a significant problem. If
the feeder’s unreliability, cost, and size are all small fractions of the
total system, then improvement will not be much noticed by the customers. Then
there is little motivation for new technology.</p>
<p>If the function is interesting to customers - print quality for example, then
we address questions 2 and 3. Here we have to be careful not to succumb to the
famous tendency to believe that everything has been invented. In the long run
there will always be the possibility of some new invention. So we use questions
2 and 3 to prioritize our technology development for the next N years, where N
might be five years for example. We try to select functions where improvement
seems probable and the improvement will make a difference to our customers. The
improvement is especially imperative if our competitors are advantaged over us.</p>
<p>To be more precise we want to do the following:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Screen all functions to select those worth further consideration for
  improvement</li>
  <li>Develop alternative possible development paths, estimate the improvement
  that would be achieved for each development path, and estimate the probability
  of actually achieving the estimated improvement</li>
  <li>Estimate the market benefit of the improvement. This will be strongly
  influenced by the competitive situation</li>
  <li>Apply an investment model to select the most lucrative paths for us to
  actually work on</li>
</ol>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Screen All Functions</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>The initial screening is done by the application of two graphs (Schulz),
Figures 5 and 6.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

Figure 5. Market position.</p>
<p>Figure 5 is used to determine if the product is important. More specifically
it is used to determine which parameters of the important products are
important.</p>
<p>Then Figure 6 is used to determine which technologies have a critical
contribution to the important parameters of the important products.</p>
<p>Study of Figures 5 and 6 will reveal the logical way to use them. For more
detail see Schulz.</p>
<p>Often this preliminary screening is all that is needed. Certain technologies
will be obvious choices for further development.</p>

<p>When more analysis is required, we proceed through the remaining three steps.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Determine Alternative Possible Development Paths</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>After we decide that a new technology might be commercially beneficial, then
we have to see if any is likely to be available. We have several paths available
to us:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li> Develop present S curve</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <ol type="a">
    <li> New invention (or imported new technology) at lower system level</li>
    <li>Improve robustness</li>
    <li>Detailed design improvements</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Move to new S curve</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>New invention</li>
    <li>Bring in external technology</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>We see that invention can move to a new S curve, or contribute to moving up
the existing S curve. For example, if the initial screening identified the paper
feeder of a copier/printer as a ripe opportunity for further technological
development, then we could invent a feedback control system that controls the
stack force, which would improve the reliability of the feed function. This was
actually done at Xerox in the late 1970s. This can be thought of as a new S
curve for the stack-force function, but as moving up the S curve for the
complete friction-retard paper feeder.</p>
<p>A representative part of the functional tree for a friction-retard paper
feeder is shown in Figure 7.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

</font><font FACE="Times">
<p align="left">Figure 7. Portion of functional tree for friction-retard paper
feeder.</p>
<p>The decision was to implement a new invention that moved the function <i>provide
stack force</i> to a new S curve.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="image67.gif" width="394" height="246"></p>
</font><font FACE="Times">
<p align="left">Figure 8. New S curve at lower level moves the higher-level
function up its S curve.</p>
<p>Going from S curve 1 to S curve 2 for the lower-level function <i>provide
stack force</i> moved up the S curve for the higher-level function <i>feed sheet</i>
from the original value O to the improved value L-L I (lower-level invention).</p>
<p>Another alternative that was developed in Xerox in the late 1970s is the
vacuum corrugation feeder (VCF). This might be initially regarded as a new S
curve, different from the S curve for the friction-retard feeder. However, the
VCF had predecessors that were vacuum feeders. Therefore, the VCF can be best
thought of as further development of the S curve for vacuum feeders. This too
was done by moving to a new S curve at a lower system level (the C in VCF).</p>
<p>Moving to a new S curve for the complete paper feeder might be using
electromagnetic forces. This has been used to hold down the paper on a plotter.
As far as I know, no one has invented a concept to successfully use it for a
paper feeder.</p>
<p>We can reformulate the generic development paths as follows:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Invention</li>
  <li>Robustness improvements</li>
  <li>Detailed design improvements</li>
  <li>Bring in external technology</li>
</ol>
<p>Usually the last three options can be evaluated adequately by known
engineering approaches. (More about robustness later.) Here we concentrate on
invention.</p>
<p>So what paths are open to us for making inventions? Here we follow after
Frauens (2000). He developed a broad approach that features TRIZ tools and the
use of the Internet to bring in information. Frauens developed the following
table.</p>

</center><font FACE="Times">
<p>These steps are done with the help of TRIZ.</p>
<i>
<p>The main axiom of TRIZ states that evolution of technological systems is
governed by objective laws.</p>
</i>
<p>We use this axiom along with specific TRIZ tools, such as the Laws of
Evolution, locating our current state on </font><font FACE="Symbol">abg</font><font FACE="Times">
phases of the S curve, and estimates of ideality. See Frauens (2000) for
details, which is strongly based on Victor Fey’s work.</p>
<p>The final result of this process is a set Y of development paths that we can
reasonably follow. Each path has an estimated improvement X that following it
would achieve, and a probability p that the improvement will be achieved in the
time outlook of our strategy. From a technical viewpoint this information (Y,X,p)
is all that is needed for completion of our technology strategy.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Estimate the Market Benefit</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>Once we know (Y,X,p) for all paths that we can identify as promising, we next
need to evaluate the likely market impact of each path. The initial screen has
already given us considerable insight. In many cases it will be sufficient.</p>
<p>The essential question is: If we succeed in achieving improvement X in the
time frame that we used to calculate the probability of success p, how much will
our market share increase? In economics this is called a utility function. This
approach has been outlined by Bauer.</p>
<p>Here we will outline a simple approach that is used in industry. If we have
been in business with this product for some time, we can use our data to develop
a customer preference model. This model says that if we improve some function by
X, then our market share will be increased by a certain amount. This is
essentially a utility function without the trappings of economic theory.</p>
<p>We end up the market analysis with the technical improvement X converted into
monetary improvement $. In other words (Y,X,p) </font><font FACE="Symbol">Þ</font><font FACE="Times">
(Y,$,p).</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Investment Model</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>Now we need to apply an investment model to determine if our improvement is
worth the investment. We must consider that the market benefits will not occur
immediately, but will only start after the new technology is in production, and
will then be further delayed by the usual diffusion and substitution time
cycles.</p>
<p>Traditionally the investment model was done by using ROI based on some
discounted cash flow (DCF). However, this has come under attack.</p>
<p>There is now a trend to use real option theory as the investment model. This
is financial option theory applied to real things, such as technology
development.</p>
<p>The justification for using real option theory instead of ROI/DCF is simple.
The latter assumes that we make one decision, and some time much later learn the
result.</p>
<p>Development work does not proceed that way. We make many intermediate
decisions. If the development is not progressing well, we can cancel the
project. We don’t have to spend the remaining investment.</p>
<p>Putting it in slightly different terms, we invest in an initial bit of work.
Then we have a better idea of the probability of success p. We can say that we
have bought an option to keep developing the idea if it shows promise. If p
keeps getting bigger fast enough at the successive decision points, we keep
going. Otherwise we don’t invest any more.</p>
<p>That in a nutshell is the rationale behind the use of real option theory to
make decisions about investment in technology development. More details are
outlined by Bauer.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phase 2 - Concept work</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>Now that the Technology Strategy has focused our work, it is time to do
creative work. Creative work is done this way:</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ol>
    <li> Generate concepts</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <ol type="a">
      <li> Understand needs</li>
      <li>Apply known effects, or combinations of effects, that promise to meet
    the needs</li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <ol type="i">
        <li> Known engineering devices</li>
        <li>Known scientific effects</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <ol start="2">
    <li> Evolve and select the best concepts</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>First I will discuss how this is done without TRIZ, and then bring in the
contributions of TRIZ.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Understand Needs</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>Many, probably most, attempts at generating new concepts go off the tracks by
not understanding the needs. Once the need is not understood, it is almost
certain that at best the creativity will meet some other need that is not useful
in the present context.</p>
<p>The technology strategy presents the needs in broad terms. It is critically
important to focus on the specific function that is to be improved. Then it is
important to know the vector of improvement that will be most beneficial. For
example, if the technology strategy has identified that the main need is better
reliability, then concepts that primarily reduce cost will be nice, but not in
the direction of greatest benefit. The technology strategy identification of the
needs is usually primarily used for funding decisions. When the concept work
starts we go into the needs in greater detail.</p>
<p>Beyond understanding the function to be improved, and the customer-observable
parameters that will be most beneficial to improve, we need to understand the
current situation of the physics. There is some system element that performs the
function that we want to improve. How does it work, and what is its role in the
higher level system. What are the values of critical functional parameters, and
what do these values suggest as fertile directions for improvement? Much weak
creativity is based on a “hand waving” understanding of the current physics.</p>
<p>In summary, understanding the needs means:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Know what function is to be improved</li>
  <li>Know which customer-observable characteristics that are associated with the
  function are most in need of improvement</li>
  <li>Understand the current physics (more generally the current details of
  operation)</li>
</ol>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Apply Known Effects</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>Once the needs are well understood, then we work to apply known effects that
might meet the needs. We might say, “Ah, ha, a feedback control system would
satisfy the need.” Or “we could make this part out of two different
materials; it doesn’t have to be uniform in its material properties.” Or we
might say, “The inelastic strain is only 0.1%; because it is so small we can
remove it by a simple process.” Contrary to some assumptions, understanding
the current physics quantitatively often leads to an invention.</p>

<p>At Xerox in the late 1970s we had a type of paper feeder called the
friction-retard feeder. It worked well, but its reliability was not good enough
for high-volume copiers and printers. We decided not to change the basic
concept, but to make improvements at lower levels of the system, as shown in
Figure 8. One lower-level function was <i>apply stack force</i>. When the stack
force was too small, a misfeed would occur. However, when the stack force was
too big, a multifeed would occur. So we wanted a small stack force, but we
wanted a large stack force. Much experimental data and analysis had revealed
that a stack force of only 0.3 pounds would successfully feed the top sheet most
of the time - more than 95% of the time. And such a small stack force would
essentially never cause a multifeed. So what to do about the small percentage of
the feeds that would misfeed when the stack force was only 0.3 pounds?</p>
<p>Armed with this data, a feedback control system became a fairly obvious
invention. Put a sensor at a critical point in the paper path. If the top sheet
did not reach that point by a critical time, then use an actuator to increase
the stack force to 0.7 pounds. I received a patent on this, and it worked very
well. You might look into your Xerox copier or printer to see if it is still
there.</p>
<p>In summary, note five points:</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ol>
    <li>A clear decision was made to not work to improve the function of the total
  feeder system, <i>feed sheet</i>, but to work to invent at a lower level of
  the system, <i>apply stack force</i><li>The customer-observable characteristic that most needed improvement,
  reliability, had been clearly identified</li>
    <li>The detailed data of the existing situation were very well known. If the
  small stack force of 0.3 pounds had only fed successfully 50% of the time,
  then the feedback control system would not have been feasible.</li>
    <li>It was recognized that the force of 0.7 pound was only needed at certain
  times</li>
    <li>A known engineering effect, feedback control, was applied.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Evolve and Select the Best Concepts</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>Many times we are happy to develop one promising concept. However, a more
complete approach is to develop several or many concepts, and then evolve and
compare them until convergence is achieved to one or two concepts to carry
forward into new products. The process that has proven highly successful for
doing this is the Pugh Concept Evolution and Selection Process.</p>

<p>One concept was chosen as the reference or datum concept. For the first run
this was concept 1. All of the other concepts were compared to the datum for
each criterion, and judged to be +, -, or essentially the same S. The matrix was
run two more times, with first concept 8 as the datum, and then concept 12 as
the datum. The team evolved the concepts and converged to hybrid concept 12A.</p>
<p>Four of the concepts are shown in Figure 10. Note that they are all drawn to
the same level of detail - just enough to represent the basic physics by which
the function would be performed.</p>

    <td valign="top">The basic concept is a rotor that provides the gyroscopic
      action. If the system is tipped, the rotor will resist the tipping by
      reason of its inertia. The angle between the rotor and the shaft becomes a
      measure of the tipping, and can be used for corrective action.
      Alternatively some other force can be applied to force the rotor to track
      with the shaft, and the magnitude of the required corrective force is a
      measure of the tipping.
      <p>It is important that the mechanical connection between the rotor and
      the shaft impose at most a trivial force relative to tipping. The only
      significant force must be the torque that is transmitted from the shaft to
      the rotor. Otherwise the basic function of the gyroscope will be
      compromised.</p>
      <p>Therefore the task here is to design the suspension that drives the
      rotor so that the tipping moments that are transmitted by the connection
      are trivial. The team developed the criteria. As the entire process uses
      comparisons with a datum concept, there is not any need to quantitatively
      specify the values for the criteria. For example, consider the criterion <i>radial
      stiffness</i>. For each concept the team asked itself the question is this
      concept better (in this case smaller) in its radial stiffness compared to
      the datum concept.</p>
      <p>In this fashion the team evolved the concepts and reduced those
      remaining in consideration. Then the team converged on the final concept.
      It selected concept 12A, and the team knew why it had selected it. After
      this detailed concept work, the team was able to defend its selection, and
      concentrate their energy on making it a success.</td>

<p>TRIZ - What does it bring to the table?</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>Everything that has been said about Concept Work up to here has been ante
TRIZ. How has TRIZ changed Concept Work? The whole point of this conference is
that TRIZ has greatly changed the best approach to Concept Work.</p>
<p>However, note that everything that has been said so far is still relevant in
the world of TRIZ. We still can benefit from everything that has been described.
Now TRIZ helps us to do some steps. We still use the basic process that has been
given:</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ol>
    <li> Generate concepts</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <ol type="a">
      <li> Understand needs</li>
      <li> Apply known effects, or combinations of effects, that promise to meet
    the needs</li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <ol type="i">
        <li> Known engineering devices</li>
        <li> Known scientific effects</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <ol start="2">
    <li> Evolve and select the best concepts</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I need some help from all of the TRIZ experts at this conference; i.e.,
everyone at the conference except me. It seems to me that TRIZ basically does
three things:</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Use Sufield analysis and Conflict Analysis to better understand needs</li>
    <li>Inserts another step after Needs; the identification of a
  high-level-of-abstraction approach that might be useful; e.g., separate the
  needs in time</li>
    <li>TRIZ uses a database of scientific effects</li>
  </ol>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Sufield analysis</p>
</blockquote>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>The Sufield represents a model of the minimum system necessary to perform a
certain function, consisting of an object, a tool, and a field [Fey, 1998]. The
function is comprised of the function object and the function interaction (e.g.,
feed sheet), represented by the noun and the verb in the function statement. The
design parameter to be selected is comprised of a tool (i.e. feed belt) and the
field (e.g., stack force + friction). While the tool indicates a hardware
concept, the basic physical principle to perform the function is defined by the
selected field. This is illustrated in Figure 11.</p>
<p>Figure 11 helps us to see the relationship between the sufield analysis and
the functional tree (Figure 7). The functional tree is used with a hardware tree
(see my book Total Quality Development). So both the sufield model and the
traditional functional tree present the same information.</p>
<p>The functional tree has proven very useful in the development of better
concepts. By concentrating attention on the function product-development people
have moved away from the devices in the Rube Goldberg cartoons that were popular
in the Sunday paper when I was young. We might say that the movement was in the
direction of increasing ideality.</p>
<p>There are invention principles that are associated with the sufield model
that are useful in guiding invention. For everyone who has made good use of the
functional tree, the sufield model is an opportunity for further enhancement of
one’s methodology.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 11. The Sufield Model, with a paper feeder as an
example.</p>
<blockquote>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Conflict Analysis</p>
</blockquote>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>In the case of the paper feeder we wanted the force to be both big and small.
This is a conflict that was alleviated by the feedback control system. In
general the identification of the conflict in the requirements provides great
help in identifying the need. This is a key feature of TRIZ. An attempt to
completely eliminate the primary conflict has been shown to be a major
contributor to creativity.</p>
<blockquote>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>High-level-of-abstraction approach</p>
</blockquote>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>Note that in the case study of the stack force in the Xerox paper feeder I
separated the needs in time. I didn’t think to myself, “Try separation of
needs in time.” I just did it, because once I understood the needs in detail,
that option occurred to me. This isn’t surprising because Altshuller cataloged
what inventors were already doing.</p>
<p>So we might say that TRIZ isn’t teaching us to do anything that is
completely new. It is helping us to do familiar things in a more systematic way
with a much higher hit rate. It helps us to leverage all previous experience.</p>
<blockquote>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Application of known effects</p>
</blockquote>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>In the case study I applied the known effect of a feedback control system.
From a TRIZ viewpoint feedback control systems are probably an indication of a
lack of ideality.</p>
<p>TRIZ concentrates on the application of known scientific effects. This has
the potential to create new types of devices that are not currently among the
known engineering effects, such as feedback control systems.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Phase 3 - Robustness Development</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>Robustness keeps the performance of the system close to the ideal function.
After the concept work, the new technology works well under favorable laboratory
conditions. The challenge is to make it work well, close to ideal, under all
conditions.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Activities</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>Every system is controlled by different parameters during its operation.
Phadke [1989] has introduced the P diagram, Figure 12.</p>
<b><i>
<p>Signal Factors</i></b> are set by users or operators to gain the intended
response of the system.</p>
<b><i>
<p>Noise factors</i></b><i> </i>are factors, which decrease the system
performance and cannot be controlled. There are three types of noise factors.</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ol>
    <li>External (environmental conditions)</li>
    <li>Internal (variations within the production process)</li>
    <li>Deterioration (performance degradation during system lifecycle)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<b><i>
<p>Control Factors</i></b> are the critical functional parameters whose values<i>
</i>are set by the system designer, and which strongly influence the system
sensitivity due to the noises. To achieve the targeted performance of the
system, there are two major methods within robust design.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i>
    </p><ol>
      <li>Parameter Design, </i>does not affect cost issues, by focusing on
    determining best control factor values for lowest system sensitivity against
    noise.
    <i>
    <li>Tolerance Design and Specification, </i>does affect cost issues, by
    focusing on reducing the tolerance range for noise factors through applying
    higher quality parts.</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>An adjustment of control factors usually doesn’t influence the cost of the
system, therefore they are key to robustness and have to be determined to their
best values. <i>Tolerance Factors </i>and<i> Adjustment Factors</i> are specific
types of control factors. While the adjustment of tolerance factors will
influence the cost of the system, setting of adjustment factors only influences
systems performance, but not its variation.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="image71.gif" width="450" height="350"></p>
</font><font FACE="Times">
<p align="left">Figure 12. Classification of Parameters influencing a System [Phadke,
1989]</p>
<p>The<i> Response </i>is the intended output of the system, which is expected
to be within the intended range by the user. Any deviation from the target value
causes quality loss according to the quality loss function.</p>
<p>The ideal function is the ideal relationship between the signal and the
response. It is:</p>
<blockquote>
</font><font COLOR="#000000">
</p><ol>
  <li>Concise statement of purpose for the system</li>
  <li>Precise physical/psychological statement</li>
  <li>Prefer linear relationships</li>
  <li>Best definitions make optimization efficient</li>
  <li>S/N ratio measures deviation from ideal function</li>
</ol>
</font><font FACE="Times">
</blockquote>
<p>Parameter Design optimizes the nominal values of the critical functional
parameters that control the performance of the system. The important steps of
parameter design are:</p>
<blockquote>
</font><font COLOR="#000000">
</p><ol>
  <li>Define ideal performance</li>
  <li>Select best S/N definition</li>
  <li>Identify critical parameters</li>
  <li>Develop sets of noises that will cause performance to deviate from ideal</li>
  <li>Use designed experiments to systematically optimize control parameters so
that performance stays as close as possible to the ideal function</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The key to success it so introduce the noises early:</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Drive the performance away from ideal</li>
    <li>Do it early. Don't wait for the factory or customers to introduce noises</li>
    <li>The PDT needs to develop the skill of introducing these noises</li>
    <li>Management needs to design this into the process and check that it is done
  to an appropriate degree</li>
  </ol>
</font><font FACE="Times">
</blockquote>
<p>The engineers’ natural tendency is to protect their new invention from
noises. It is critically important to overcome this, and introduce the noises
early.</p>
<p>As an example, the Xerox paper feeder that has been described before was
moved much farther up its S curve by a very thorough improvement of its
robustness, from L-L I to R, Figure 13. This has produced a very robust paper
feeder that was put into production in 1981. It has since been flexibly applied
in many copiers and printers over a wide range of speeds without the necessity
for any additional development.</p>

<p>Robustness achieves the fundamental reliability of the new invention. It
greatly facilitates technology transfer, flexibility, and reduced
commercialization time.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Phase 4 - Technology Selection, Transfer, and Integration</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>After the technology is successfully developed there is a natural tendency to
believe that the job is finished. Nothing could be farther from the truth.
Technology selection and transfer are often difficult or insurmountable hurdles.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Technology Selection</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>There are several criteria, which have to be considered for a new
technological concept to be eligible into product programs. In general four
aspects have to be fulfilled:</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Superiority</li>
    <li>Robustness</li>
    <li>Flexibility</li>
    <li>Maturity</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In selecting the technologies for a new product, the Pugh concept selection
is used again. Now the alternatives that are considered are new technologies,
current technologies, and outside purchase.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Helvetica">
<p>Technology Transfer</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Times">
<p>Basically each transfer of technologies has a multi-dimensional perspective,
as already pointed out in a study of the International Space University [ISU,
1997]. A successful transfer of technology consists of four major aspects.</p>
<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Know-What, that is the knowledge about the technology to be transferred</li>
    <li>Know-Who, that is the 'knowledge carrier' having all elements of the
  knowledge necessary for the transfer</li>
    <li>Know-Why, that is the theoretical base of the technology in terms of its
  basic and fundamental knowledge</li>
    <li>Know-How, that is the processes, methods, or boundary conditions necessary
  for a successful application of the transferred technology</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Clausing [1994] identified a ‘<i>unfortunate tendency towards rivalry
between the product engineering division and the technology organization</i>’.
A cultural barrier, ‘<i>not invented here</i>’ and other dysfunctions lower
the probability of a successful technology transfer, which is illustrated in
Figure 14 (upper part), and therefore endanger a successful technology
development. Those problems are mainly based on competitive instincts within the
organization and have to be overcome by the right organizational environment.</p>
<p>Thus the most successful approach to technology transfer into product
programs is based on the ‘transfer of people’. Clausing [1994] proposes the
establishment of a technology transfer team, which is consisting of engineers
from product engineering and technology development. This will furthermore
enhance the necessary knowledge transfer for incorporating new technologies into
product programs and is illustrated in Figure 14 (lower part). The acceptance of
new technologies can even be increased, by assembling the appropriate
development teams throughout the entire technology development process.</p>

<p>The current approach to the implementation of TRIZ - nucleation and growth -
will not be successful. TRIZ must be integrated with the total process - this

<p>Author's Biography</p>
<b>
<p>Don Clausing</b> joined the MIT faculty in 1986 after working in industry for
three decades. He created the first MIT course on product development. It
integrated basic concurrent engineering, Taguchi methods, QFD, Pugh concept
selection, technology readiness, reusability, and effective management in a
comprehensive development process to achieve lower manufacturing cost, higher
quality, and shorter development times than are currently standard in the United
States. Clausing's book, Total Quality Development, was published by ASME Press
in March 1994. In 1996 he was a cofounder of MIT's Center for Innovation in
Product Development (CIPD). Clausing retired from MIT in the summer of 2000.</p>
