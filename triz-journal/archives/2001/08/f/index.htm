<p>The <a href="../../03/e/index.htm"> TRIZ Challenge from March</a> was on Landmines. Here is the background
information provided by Ian Care:</p>
<p>Landmines cost less than $3 each, the new ones are predominately plastic. The
automatic removal machines are only suitable for certain terrain and are
expensive.</p>
<p>Even using relatively cheap labour (e.g. in Africa) the cost of clearing one
mine is around $300 (i.e. around 100 times it's cost). The real problem is not
finding mines. We can already do that quite well with metal detectors, ground
radar, EM (Electro Magnetic) probes and manual prodders. Despite this the vast
bulk of the £600 million or so that has been spent on &quot;Humanitarian
Demining Research&quot; has been spent on this already solved problem, <i>and so
far has failed to produce any new tools for local deminers in the poor countries
</i>(italics added for emphasis).</p>
<p>The real problems are in such areas as: how to clear vegetation that may
contain trip-wire mines; how to reliably survey the extent of mined areas which
may be
</font> <font size="2">
contaminated by UneXploded Ordinance (UXO) or caches of arms and not mines as
such; and then how to mark them permanently in countries so poor that even
</font> <font size="2">
painted rocks are likely to be taken because people have another use for
them.</p>
<p>Unlike military demining, humanitarian demining is not essentially about
finding mines, it is the process of being able to declare land entirely free
from all explosive
</font> <font size="2">
debris; i.e. it is about finding land where there are no mines. Frequently
this does not involve any mines, it is simply making sure that a possibly mined
area is not
</font> <font size="2">
actually mined, a process sometimes called Area Reduction. Sniffing
technologies are one of the most promising ways of doing this though as yet the
only sniffers
</font> <font size="2">
used in the field are dogs. There are a number of companies pursuing
different routes to get the sensitivity high enough to be able to confidently
declare an absence of mines.</p>
<p>So the challenges are: How do we mark an area that is known to be mined, or
is munitions free in poor countries? How do we give poor people in poor
countries
</font> <font size="2">
the means to clear land to make it habitable and cultivatable?</p>

<p align="left">Micro Digging Flail</p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE<br>
Manual probing is a slow and dangerous process. The object of this project was
to build a simple, inexpensive device that allows an operator to perform this
task, at least as quickly, and hopefully more so than with the existing
approach.<br>
<br>
DESIGN<br>
The machine being investigated to replace manual probing is a man-portable
digging flail. The second generation of the device has a 20 cm wide flail, with
three chains, powered by a small gasoline engine, in this case a modified
chainsaw. See Figure 1. Not shown is the frame that catches earth, rocks, roots
etc as they are thrown backwards out of the hole. The flail is attached to a
long, relatively small diameter extension stick, shown at the top of Figure 1.
The extension stick holds the flail over the &quot;hot spot&quot; (a site
detected by a metal detector as a potential land mine) and keeps the device
itself out of direct contact with the bulk of the blast. Air pots between the
base and flail arm allow the device to lower by gravity at a controlled rate
once released by the RC unit. The device weighs about 13 Kg, and is foldable for
easy transportation. Washers (4 cm diameter) attached to the ends of each chain
allow the little device to remove soil from the ground quite effectively.

</p>
<p>EXPERIMENT</p>
<p>Work to date includes two prototypes. The first prototype was electrically
powered, with a wooden frame. It was used to investigate the concept of digging
with a flail-type device, and to develop the digging heads located at the ends
of the chains. This device proved that digging was a viable concept. The first
prototype dug the hole shown in Figure 3 in 30 seconds using a 1 HP motor.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 3 - Hole Dug by Prototype #1</p>
</font></b><font size="2">
<p>The second prototype, which is unfinished at the time of this writing, is
built from basic materials such as steel pipe, that would be easy to find and
repair in third world countries, and powered by a small gasoline engine to aid
portability. It weighs 13 Kgs, which is still a little bit heavy, but has
opportunities for weight reductions, such as replacing the portion of the base
that contacts the ground with wood rather than steel.</p>
<p>INTENDED OPERATION<br>
The current idea is to use this micro-flail as follows: once a hot spot has been
found with a metal detector, the deminer positions the flail over the spot and
turns it on. (It currently works by radio control, allowing the operator to be
anywhere in a 100 meter radius.) Once actuated, the device rotates and lowers
itself into the ground, automatically excavating whatever was beneath it. The
dirt is thrown into a contained catch area (a box, without a bottom, on the
ground). If the site contained just a random bit of metal, the offending piece
of metal will be easier to find in the catch area, potentially by a magnet in
the loose pile of dirt that the device creates. In the event the device sets off
a mine, it is designed to withstand AP blasts. (There is an assumption that if
the area is known to have anti-tank mines with metal detector signatures that
are indestinguishable from an AP mine, this device should not be used.) If a UXO
or unexploded mine is somehow thrown from the hole, again, it will be easy to
see, and would then be blown in place. Set up time is minimal. The flail that
can dig out a 20 cm wide x 30 cm long x 15 deep volume in medium ground in about
30 seconds using a 1 HP motor.
</p>
<p>Our goal is to have a cycle time that is significantly faster than
conventional probing, and would also be safer because the &quot;prober&quot; is
not working over the mine. The hope is that a machine like this could bridge the
gap between mechanical mine clearing, and hand probing. Another advantage is
that the device is capable of digging through soils filled with small roots and
rocks, an environment where a probe is almost useless.</p>
<p>
FUTURE WORK<br>
We perceive this project to fall into the category of “high risk/ high reward.”
It is well-understood that the incorporation of this device into mine clearance
operations would entail a major alteration of the SOPs, and even the basic
approach to the process as a whole. In this one project, we believed that the
potential for large gains in speed and safety may justify large deviations from
the existing approach.</p>
<p>The first prototype proved the viability that a man-portable device can
determine that a site is free of a land mine in half a minute using a small
motor. The next task is to determine how this device could used in an effective
manner in a large scale demining operation. There are significant logistical
issues to be addressed. This is work that must be done with personnel familiar
with the real-world limitations imposed by day-to-day field operations.</p>
<p>
The prototype itself needs to be tested both by digging up false positives, and
seeing how long it takes to isolate the piece of metal, and by exploding AP
mines underneath to determine its robustness. We expect that the coupling
between the explosion and the device is sufficiently small that the device will
not be damaged, and that the extension stick will survive multiple blasts.</p>
<p>Extensive work remain, but the rewards of a semi-automated digging flail such
as this could be high.</p>

<p align="left">Magic Grapple</p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>
BACKGROUND<br>
Trip wires present a dangerous nuisance in mine fields. Theoretically, a grapple
may be tossed across a suspected area, dragged back and thereby pulling on trip
wires, thereby detonating these booby-trapped mines in a controlled manner. In
practice, grapples are almost never used for two reasons.</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Grapples are designed to grab things. As a result, they successfully grab
  trees and bushes, and as a result are nearly impossible to use in locations
  where vegetation is present. Often times the deminer needs to be quite close
  to the grapple to perform the gyrations necessary to free it.</li>
  <li>Trip wires, by their very nature, detonate land mines located in uncertain
  location. It is therefore critical that the deminer be located quite some
  distance before pulling a grapple with the intent of detonating hidden land
  mines.</li>
</ol>
<p>The combination of these two problems makes grapples all but useless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>Our goal was to create a grapple that would catch trip wires, but not catch
vegetation. The intent was that by eliminating the first problem, several
methods become feasible to approach the second problem. Furthermore, we wanted
the design to be simple, and inexpensive to manufacture.</p>
<p>
DESIGN</p>
<p>The design could not be simpler. We decided that a sphere attached to a rope
had a strong potential to meet the design objectives. We tried two different
diameters, 65mm and 80mm, resulting in weights of 1Kg and 1.8 Kg respectively.
In order to eliminate the risk of energy being stored in the rope while it was
held in tension, a Kevlar rope was used. Because the Kevlar is essentially
inextensible, it eliminates the risk of the grapple flying towards the deminer
as it releases from tree limbs and the like.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 4 - Two Grapple Prototypes</p>
</font></b><font size="2">
<p>PROTOTYPE MANUFACTURE<br>
Both spheres are made of a mild steel. The smaller was made by drilling a
ready-made sphere. The larger was machined from a solid block, and then drilled.
The kevlar rope was then threaded through the hole and knotted.<br>
</p>
<p>
EXPERIMENTATION<br>
Both devices were thrown numerous times into three types of vegetation to
determine how effectively they avoided entrapment. These types included: low and
dense shrubbery; a dense growth of trees, each approximately 3-5 meters tall,
and some larger many-limbed trees. In many cases these types were combined in
one area.</p>
<p>Trip wires were placed at different heights in the forest, from two inches
off the ground to four feet high. The grapple was thrown approximately 15 to 20
meters into the forest with each throw. At no time while the grapples were being
drawn back was either snagged by vegetation such that it could not be easily
removed by pulling on the rope. In approximately 20 percent of the throws, the
grapple was lofted by a branch or shrub so that it never contacted the trip
wire. Such would be the case with any grapple. Numerous throws are required at
different heights to ensure effective clearance. However, in the cases where the
grapple contacted the trip wire, the trip wire was pulled with sufficient force
to actuate a land mine. It required at least 20 pounds force to release the
grapple from contact with a trip wire, and in many cases the grapple would not
release from it until the trip wire broke.</p>
<p>It was determined that the smaller of the two grapples was preferred. While
the heavier grapple was more effective at remaining at ground level as it was
pulled back through the forest, it could not be thrown as deeply or as flat a
parabola. The smaller prototype could be comfortably thrown deeper into the
forest, required less force to remove</p>
<p>
FUTURE WORK<br>
Additional work should be done to confirm develop a better statistical
understanding of the effectiveness of the device. However, before this work is
undertaken, there should be an exploration of whether or not a device that
solves the first problem of the two noted above is sufficient to make grapples a
useful device. Our observation (as researchers) is that once a grapple device
may be easily pulled through vegetation it becomes much more feasible for the
deminer to hide in a hole, behind a shield (such as a car) or simply at a large
distance, thereby thereby creating the option for grapples to be a useful tool.
This believe should be corroborated with persons in the field, to determine the
validity of this belief, before additional work is done on this project.</p>

OVERVIEW<br>
One of the early class observations was that the manual probing process is only
tangentially a search for land mines. More accurately, the manual probing
process is the search for bits of metal in a field that also contains a few land
mines. Based on this observation we decided to spend some time ignoring the land
mine problem, but instead focusing on improving the rate at which bits of metal
may be found within the context of the process currently used to find land
mines.</p>
<p>
DESIGN</p>
<p>Our design objective led to a few innovative applications of traditional
metal detection technologies. Two ideas seemed more interesting that the rest:
1) a metal detector built into a glove, providing the prodder with the ability
to constantly reassess conditions at the hot spot throughout the process, and in
some ways provide him with a “superhuman” ability in the sense that his hand
itself has the ability to find metal; 2) a metal detector built into the tip of
a probe, thereby revealing a completely new set of information as the manual
process is performed in the traditional way.</p>
<p>An important consideration regarding the utility of these devices is the
issue of sensitivity. Metal detectors as they are currently used for mine
clearance require constant adjustment. However, this application does not have
the same requirements, because <i>it is already known that a signal exists
within a few inches</i>. The issue is only one of pin-pointing it. Therefore, it
is acceptable to set the sensitivity relatively low so that only when the
deminer is within a few centimeters will a signal be heard.</p>
<p>1) Smart Glove</p>
<p>Figure 1shows a glove with a metal detector built into the palm. Traditional
PEMI technology may be used to provide the worker near-constant feedback with
regard to the existence of a metal fragment throughout the probing/excavation
process, simply by moving his open hand over the surface.</p>

</font></b><font size="2">
<p>Figure 2 shows the device itself. The device is powered by a cable that runs
down the prodder’s arm to a metal detection unit mounted to his back or waist.
Because the device does NOT need to be very sensitive or accurately ground
balanced, the unit can be small and relatively inexpensive, such as the
cigarette pack-sized coin detectors commonly sold for under $50.</p>

</font></b><font size="2">
<p>2) Smart Probe</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows a PEMI metal-detection coil built onto the tip of a fiberglass
rod, representing a probe stick. This design searches passively for the bit of
metal as an active search for the mine is being conducted. Often times the
deminer passes the probe past the sourceof the false positive signal in the
search for a potential mine. With the smart probe, he will be alerted that he
has just passed it. This knowledge dramatically shortens the overall search
process.</p>
<p>The smart probe prototype (shown below) is obviously lacking in several
respects. Obviously it is too short. More importantly, the second generation
prototype will have a co-axial coil orientation, rather than co-radial, so that
it may be made within the material of the probe stick, so that the electronics
will be isolated from abrasion and flexure. A trough will be routed along the
stick length to contain the leads, and then potted with an epoxy fill. (Note
that all Smart Probe devices would be based on fiberglass sticks.)</p>

<p>EXPERIMENTATION<br>
The palm detector and the probe detector work well at finding buried bits of
metal on the order of one gram with the sensitivity adjustmet such that constant
ground balance is not necessary. However, the issue is not whether or not we can
make such devices operable. The issue is whether or not prodders would benefit
from having a metal detector built into their palm, or probe.</p>

<p align="left">Safe Practice Mine</p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>It is highly desirable to have practice land mines for deminer and mine
awareness training. There are several versions of such devices, but they tend to
be expensive (i.e cost money). Another issue is that some practive mines may be
easily modified to become real mines. Therefore, our goal was to create an
inexpensive and safe practice mine that can be readily made by anyone.</p>
<p>
DESIGN<br>
The design consists of simple wooden pieces actuated by a few rubber bands. When
the mine is stepped on, a flag bursts out of the ground (see Figure 1) to
announce that it has been activated.</p>

required for actuation.</p>

<p align="left">Rotary Probe</p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>Many mine fields have difficult probing conditions. Hard soils, roots, and
rocks are common features of mine fields that make probing difficult. Reducing
the force required to perform manual probing operations in these conditions
should increase the speed and safety of the process.</p>
<p>
DESIGN<br>
The idea was to use an off-the-shelf device to rotate the probe stick at low
speeds, such as 10-20 RPM. The objective was not to “drill” into the soil
but to use an asymmetric probe (such as an oval) so that the soil was broken up
to ease entry of the probe.</p>

concept is sound, then it would be appropriate to develop a sealed version

<p align="left">
</font><font size="2">Detachable Probe Shield</p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>
BACKGROUND<br>
To protect the hand of the prodder, some probe sticks are made with shields
built into the handle. If a mine explodes during the probing process, the shield
provides an extra level of protection to the hand grasping the tool. However
shield-equipped probes are difficult to transport because they stack poorly.
This is a significant problem because of the hard-to-access locations in which
demining typically occurs. Equipment must be carried into the field each day,
and portability is an important concern. To address this issue we focused on the
design, optimization, and manufacture of mine probes with detachable hand
shields.</p>
<p>
OBJECTIVES<br>
The objective was to develop a probe that provides detachable hand protection
that would be readily accepted by the demining community. We recognized that a
simple design, one which could be inexpensively manufactured and easily used,
would be of significant benefit. We imposed the requirement that our probe must
not interfere with the deminer's technique. It was felt that altering the
existing ergonomics might lead to rejection by the demining community and that
would negate any effort to improve safety.
</p>
<p>
DESIGN<br>
Two designs, one stressing simplicity and the other durability (perhaps to the
point of excess) were chosen for development and field testing. The design
parameters were safety, simplicity of manufacture, and ease of assembly. Two
designs were selected:</p>
<p>Design 1) Taper Lock<br>
A taper (determined to be one degree) is machined onto the end of the probe
handle and into the mating a hole on the shield. A wood mock-up quickly
confirmed that the taper lock could provide a secure connection between the
shield and handle. The shield was attach from the front of the handle, so the
shield will remain in place in the event of a blast. The taper has been designed
excessively long so that as the device wears there will still be positive
locking between the shield and probe handle. In the final design, the taper lock
is surprisingly secure, and</p>

<p>Design 2) Threaded Fastener<br>
The threaded fastener design offered an additional function. In this design the
shield is held to the handle with a thumb screw mounted on the front face. The
thumb screw is permanently attached to the shield, so that the design still has
a total of two pieces. The thumb screw attaches to a metal thread deeply
embedded within the handle. This design takes more time to manufacture and to
assemble than the taper lock system, but has the added advantage that the
deminer can push forward on the shield without any concern.</p>

<p>PROTOTYPE MANUFACTURE</p>
<p>Both designs conform to Andy Smith's recommendations for probe safety and
ergonomics. The recommendations cover handle and shield dimensions, probe
length, probe/handle attachment, and material choice. The probe shield was
cold-formed using a vice and a bending bar. Lexan was used for the handle and
the shield. Both designs were equipped with the MIT tapered probe tip. Also, the
handles were knurled to facilitate grasping in hot, humid environments</p>
<p>
EXPERIMENTATION</p>
<p>Both designs seem to work well. The devices disassemble quickly, and
significantly improve the portability of shielded probes. However, detailed
evaluation must be done by field personel.

FUTURE WORK<br>
Feedback is necessary from the field to establish which of the two designs is
preferable. If prodders do not have a tendency or desire to use the shield as an
aid to force the probe into the ground, than the taper lock design would be
preferable, because it is less expensive, easier to make, and faster to assemble
and disassemble. If it is determined that the deminer shield have the option of
using the shield as a force point, then the thumb screw version is required and
additional testing should be done to confirm that is no risk of the thumb screw
being blown off in a blast.</p>
<p>Six additional prototypes have been manufactured and are ready to fulfill a
request from Zimbabwe.</p>

</font><font size="2">
<p>
BACKGROUND<br>
It makes sense to wear face protection when looking for landmines. Unfortunately
visors tend to become scratched and hazy during normal field use. In order to
see their work clearly, prodders often lift their visors, negating the purpose
of wearing them. An effective low-cost method to restore the clarity of these
visors, without degrading their mechanical properties would be useful.</p>
<p>
EXPERIMENTATION<br>
Clear polycarbonate was scratched extensively with sandpaper to simulate
extended use. Then various approaches were tried to restore clarity to the
material. The methods fall into three broad categories.</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Cleaning with a solvent</li>
  <li>Solvent bonding a thin layer of clear material over the surface.</li>
  <li>Heating</li>
</ol>
<u>
<p>1) Cleaning with Solvent</p>
</u>
<p>Dipping was the preferred method to apply solvent. (Wiping and spraying were
also tried with poor success.) In each case, we used acetone. The samples in
Figure 1 were scratched and the dipped in acetone. The upper piece was deeply
scratched. Dipping resulted in marked, but not perfect improvement. The lower
sample was less deeply scratched, but still enough to completely obscure the
visor. This sample was restored to near-new quality with an acetone dip.</p>

<p align="left">Figure 19 - Dipping Test Results</p>
<p>Several dozen material samples are currently in an accelerated UV degradation
test chamber so that the combination effect of exposure to sunlight and acetone
may be measured. These results will be available in a few weeks.</p>
<p>The concept is that if solvent dipping can effectively restore visors to new
condition it would be cost advantageous to make a curved plastic bucket, shaped
like a visor, capable of holding a fraction of a liter of solvent. Visors may
then be dipped and restored to new at extremely low cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>2) Solvent Bonding a New Layer</p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>Similar results were found with solvent bonding an additional thin layer of
material. While deeper scratches were removed with this method, bubbles were
difficult to avoid. This method has the advantage of adding material over time
and therefore eliminating concerns that the mechanical integrity may be
compromised.</p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>3) Heat</p>
</font><font size="2">
<p>Heating with a torch seems to work fairly well, although raised some concerns
about uneven tempering. Further work needs to be done.</p>
<p>
FUTURE WORK<br>
This project is still in progress, although early results appear promising. More
will be learned after the samples are removed from the UV accelerated life test
and been tested for mechanical degradation.</p>
