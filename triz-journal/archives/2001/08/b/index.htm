<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introduction</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This paper focuses on some of the conflicts and
contradictions associated with the evolution of the retail food industry, most
notably the conflict between decreasing consumer time for preparation of food
versus an often-corresponding desire to enjoy a product that fits their precise
wishes. As quoted from (1) above, customers do not necessarily want more choice-
they want ‘exactly what they want’. This especially includes instances where
although consumers know what they want <i>when they see it</i>, they couldn’t
define it for you before they’ve seen it (i.e. excitement quality).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This particular dilemma is examined through the perspective
of the trends of evolution uncovered by researchers of the Theory of Inventive
Problem Solving, TRIZ in order to see how we got to where we are today, and
where the trends say consumers - and thus the products that will meet their
changing needs - will go in the future. After that, we highlight a number of
emerging products that appear consistent with these trends, and investigate how
other TRIZ tools - most notably those concerned with contradiction-elimination -
may be deployed to provide new product development opportunities.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trends of Evolution</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although originally uncovered via analysis of the global
patent database, the trends of evolution identified by TRIZ researchers have
already been seen to be highly consistent with the evolution of non-technical
systems (3).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The over-riding evolution trend is one towards increasing ‘ideality’.
TRIZ defines ideality as:</p>
<div align="left">
  <center>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">
        <p align="left"><b>Ideality = <font FACE="Symbol">S</font>Benefits/(<font FACE="Symbol">S</font>Costs
        + <font FACE="Symbol">S</font>Harms)</b></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trend states that systems will evolve to deliver
increasing levels of end-user ‘benefit’ with decreasing levels of cost and
‘harm’ (environmental impact, adverse side-effects, etc). During the 20th
century, the food industry necessarily focused on economic mass production of
‘safe’, ready-made foods. This trend was largely driven by a combination of
three main factors; rapidly increasing population, increasing legal
responsibility for delivering products which did not cause harm to the consumer,
and decreasing desire on the part of the consumer to spend time preparing meals.
In the eyes of many consumers, this increase in overall ideality has been
achieved by focus on cost and harm rather than ‘benefit’, and in many senses
the emerging trend towards mass customisation is a consumer-lead drive to
redress the balance between the top and bottom elements of the ideality
equation. More benefits in this case may be interpreted as increased sensory
pleasurable (‘home-made’) food, tailored (or customised) to the specific
requirements of each individual consumer. In many senses the conflict between
the top and bottom halves of the ideality equation represents a fundamental food
industry trade-off situation. TRIZ research has shown that this trade-off is
similarly fundamental for a good number of other systems. They have also shown,
however, that there are ways of beating the trade-offs. We will examine such
strategies later.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More detailed evolution trends relevant to the issue at hand
include:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Object Segmentation (Figure 1) - this is the trend most
connected to the mass customisation trend; in technical terms the trend shows
that systems evolve towards increasing levels of segmentation. The non-technical
market analogy firmly suggests not just an evolution towards ‘markets of one’,
but also further segmentation to the segmentation into different desires at
different times (for example, a ‘breakfast yoghurt’ is different from a ‘dessert
yoghurt’).</p>

<p align="left">Figure 1: ‘Object Segmentation Trend</p>
</font></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This segmentation trend is also specifically relevant to the
‘home customisable’ product offerings made by food manufacturers - with a
growing number of emerging ‘segmented’ product packaging concepts. Here are
a few examples of food products that have been developed and released onto the
marketplace over the past few years:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Freshmade Creations (Kraft)- add meat to the contents of
  the box that includes rice or paste, sauce and cheese, depending on the
  variety. These products are marketed next to the fresh meat they require.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nestles FrshNes Line- very similar to the above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">General Mills Betty Crocker Dinner Partners- Released in
1992- compartment of pasta and sauce and meat- stores added the meat- not very
successful.</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Decreasing Human Involvement (Figure 2) - the trend
highlighting the increasing level of automisation in the world as ‘things’
become progressively able to achieve better results than humans.</p>

</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mono-Bi-Poly (Figure 3) - the trend towards increasing system
functionality. From a food industry evolution perspective, the trend is
specifically relevant to the idea of ‘complementors’ first discussed in ‘Co-opetition’
(References 4 and 5)</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="index.4.gif" width="356" height="74"></p>
</font><b><font SIZE="2">
<p align="left">Figure 3: ‘Mono-Bi-Poly’ Trend</p>
</font></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several existing and emerging instances of this
trend in action. The underlying concept succeeds through the emergence of
win-win situations when different sectors integrate their product offerings. The
recent Muller/Kellogg’s integrated yoghurt and cereal product - Figure 4 - is
a good example of such a win-win situation in which both companies sell more of
their product, and the consumer gets a ‘new’ and, if the market research has
been done correctly, attractive product concept.</p>

</font><b><font SIZE="2">
<p align="left">Figure 4: ‘Mono-Bi-Poly’ Product ‘Complementors’</p>
</font></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other TRIZ trends will say that at some point in the
future, consumers will work out that they can achieve this same - if not a more
flexible - solution by buying the yoghurt and cereal separately and integrating
them to suit individual taste. Kellogg’s and Muller both then lose the added
value (and hence price) associated with having the original idea, but should
continue to benefit by selling more product.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This example, perhaps offers an important clue to the likely
directions ‘home customisable’ evolution will travel: Muller/Kellogg’s
introduce a complementary product offering, the market picks up on this offering
(this is probably the most uncertain part), but quickly realises they can
achieve a readily home-customised version of the product that better meets their
specific desires (e.g. I want strawberry yoghurt and a blend of Special K and
muesli, for example) than any commercially viable range of combinations that
Muller and Kellogg’s could assemble; consumers eat more yoghurt and cereal;
everyone’s ideality increases.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are of course several other trends uncovered by TRIZ
researchers, but we will restrict ourselves to looking at just these ones due to
their specific relevance to the home customisable subject.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contradictions</p>
</b><font FACE="Times New Roman"></font><i>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“Convenient, timesaving meal solutions has improved the
  gap on restaurant quality”.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“Many consumers enjoy the cooking process- several
  products (as above) required more active involvement than those that can
  simply be tossed into a microwave”.</p>
</i>
<p>(Prepared Foods, April 20007)</p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Relating these issues and the contradiction described at the
beginning of the article - that of parallel but conflicting desires for low
preparation time of a product which tastes ‘home-made’ and is adaptable to
different individual tastes, TRIZ suggests that similar conflicts have been
successfully tackled in other sectors using a very limited range of inventive
strategies.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In fact only 40 generic strategies have thus far been
identified from the analysis of over 2 million patents. Reference 6 has
discussed the use of such strategies in the context of mass customisation and
concluded that of the 40 strategies, there are a distinct few that have thus far
been successfully applied by companies to achieve viable mass-customised product
or service offerings. At the head of this list of strategies are the Inventive
Principles Segmentation, Dynamics, Taking Out and Parameter Changes.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The use of these and other Principles are examined in the
design of food product and packaging concepts relevant to solving ‘home
customisation’ related contradictions:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thinking about people within one household having different
tastes - for example a household in which one partner enjoys hot, spicy foods
and the other does not - we offer an example of a product using the inventive
principles Dynamics, Taking Out, Parameter Changes:</p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Theoretical Food Product utilising TRIZ principles:</p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Package: 3 Segments. 1: Segment: Basic Tomato Sauce. 2nd
Segment: Chilli and Jalepeno Salsa Frozen, or Fresh. 3rd Segment: Basil and
Parsley.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In other words we have ‘taken out’ the herbs or ‘real
flavourings’. It has also increased the Dynamism of the product- now each
customer can mix part of the tomato sauce with the preferred mix (Chilli and
Jalepeno) and different individuals can mix the base tomato sauce with the Basil
and Parsley for an ‘Italian’ type sauce. On top of this they can also choose
your preferred meat (or vegetarian equivalent) to go with it. This product also
uses ‘parameter changes’- in that the herbs can be frozen using already
existing technologies.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="b01.gif" width="500" height="150"></p>
<b><font SIZE="2">
<p align="left">Figure 5: Segmented Ready-meal Product Concept</p>
</font></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The product above is very much a ‘fresh like’ product
giving the consumer choices (as in fresh food/home-based preparation) of
preparation, and utilising already existing technologies (such as frozen herb
products). Combination with the mono-bi-poly ‘complementor’ trend from the
earlier Muller/Kellogg’s example - for example by co-branding well known sauce
brands with well known herb brand with well known chilli brand (etc) is likely
to be a helpful marketing aid.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An example of another product offering ‘choices’ is Unox
Townsend and Eine Sauce- which incorporates a concentrated sauce paste
(parameter changes) to make one litre of brown, white or tomato sauce (increase
dynamism). This is the only product we are aware of offering this kind of choice
to the consumer (apart from our theoretical product!).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By way of another example of solutions to the home-customisable
issue we might examine parallels between the soft drinks and particularly fruit
squash market and the highly segmented and flexible solutions adopted by Dulux
(in their ability to offer of a massive range of paint colours through in-store
mixing of a relatively small number of basic paint colours) and in-store coffee
blenders that allow customers to configure their own blend of different beans. A
similar strategy may work well in the fruit drinks sector (Figure 6 cartoons a
possible solution) given the decreasing economic viability of offering massive
numbers of different flavours and flavour combinations versus the increasing
desire of consumers to receive a fruit drink suited to their individual tastes.
As well as offering a good sales ‘gimmick’, the concept would appear to
generate real customisation benefits. Taken a step further towards real home-customisation,
the idea of a home-blendable range of squash bottles is probably not beyond the
realms of possibility (the ideality trend would perhaps suggest an ultimate
evolution to a system by which we are all offered a ‘personal preference blend’
option that causes the dispenser (either at the supermarket, or more likely
somewhere I don’t need to visit) to dispense each of our favourite blends -
which the dispenser either learns by recording our historical use of the machine
or by matching blend to a set of acquired questionnaire responses.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discussion</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Muller/Kellogg’s example of complementary integration
of product offerings may serve as a useful exemplar of the whole ‘home-customisable’
issue. The great beauty of their yoghurt plus cereal idea is not so much the
merging of these two products, but the merger of two well established and
respected brand names. This factor may be the trigger necessary to make this
concept successful. Assuming it is, however, because the food industry operates
in a rapidly evolving marketplace - in which the most successful advertising
feature continues to be the word ‘NEW’ - consumers may be expected to
quickly learn that they can increase their ‘ideality’ - i.e. get a more
customised product and a lower cost - by reproducing the product from
ingredients already existing in the home. This is not a bad thing from the
perspective of either Muller or Kellogg’s as they should still be selling more
product. More importantly, they will (or should be) already be working on
follow-on innovations before the current market peaks and declines.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cycle of innovation may be expected to work well in
other areas - for example the segmented pasta sauce product or fruit drink
concepts described above - for some time, albeit with the background knowledge
that one of the known characteristics of the underlying TRIZ mono-bi-poly trend
is that it can only happen so many times before the marketplace tires of the
concept.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the TRIZ trends hold true then ‘home-customisation’
will continue to be a dominant trend in the food industry. In a rapidly evolving
market like food, contradictions constantly emerge to limit the potential of a
given solution concept. TRIZ contradictions and trends tools offer much to help
overcome these contradictions to the benefit of both consumer and manufacturer
alike.</p>
