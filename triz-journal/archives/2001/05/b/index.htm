<p>ABSTRACT</p>
</b>
<p>Life Fitness, the leader in the exercise equipment industry, manufactures
both cardiovascular and weight training equipment. The paper will present a case
study of successfully using TRIZ methodology and Design of Experiment (DOE) to
solve a longstanding design deficiency in Life Fitness commercial treadmills.
Using Algorithm for Conflict Elimination (ACE), a derivation of ARIZ, engineers
at Life Fitness dissected a nozzle-clogging problem and came up with a no-cost
solution using existing system resources. DOE was used next to optimize the
settings of the solution. The resulting feature, called EVERWAX<sup><font face="Symbol">Ô</font></sup>,
was immediately put into production, and it greatly increased customer
satisfaction. The solution is currently undergoing the patent application
process.</p>
<b><u><sup></sup></u>
<p>Life Fitness and TRIZ</p>
</b>
<p>As a research project, TRIZ was introduced to and practiced at Life Fitness
by working with a TRIZ consultant, Gregory Yezersky. The project had multiple
goals, one of which was using TRIZ to tackle a real life technical problem. The
problem the group decided to take on was the nozzle-clogging problem on Life
Fitness commercial treadmills.</p>

<p>Most treadmills are mechanically simple with a belt looped around two
rollers. One of the rollers is driven by a motor and moves the belt. A deck in
between the rollers supports the runners’ weight. Because the belt and the
deck have a sliding interface, belt and deck life depend on proper lubrication.</p>
<p>Life Fitness commercial treadmills employ paraffin wax as the lubricant for
the belt and deck interface. Initially, solid wax deposited on the deck is the
primary source of lubrication, and as the solid wax is worn away with treadmill
usage, wax is replenished by dispensing wax emulsion onto the belt.</p>

<p>Wax emulsion consists of paraffin wax, emulsifiers, and water. The emulsifier
is used to “suspend” or emulsify wax into a water-based solution. Each time
the nozzle sprays wax emulsion, some wax emulsion is left at the nozzle orifice.
A tough layer of wax and emulsifier residue forms when the water evaporates. The
residue builds up after multiple sprays and begins to clog the nozzle, and
eventually the nozzle can be completely clogged.</p>
<b><sup></sup>
<p>Past Attempts To Solve Nozzle Clogging</p>
</b>
<p>In the past, several attempts have been made to remedy the nozzle-clogging
problem.</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Different angles of nozzle position have been tried. Although optimized
    angles of nozzle position alleviated nozzle clogging by changing the drip
    point location, it only delayed nozzle clogging.</li>
  <li>Different types of nozzles and different nozzle coatings, such as Teflon,
    have been tried, but failed because nozzles still clogged.</li>
  <li>Another attempt was the addition of a heating element to the nozzle.
    Although the heated nozzle demonstrated some success, added cost, safety
    concerns, and electrical system limitation prevented the implementation of
    the heated nozzle.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result, Life Fitness recommended changing the nozzle every three weeks.
However, customers often complained about the time-consuming maintenance
procedure or just ignored it. When wax is not replenished at the belt and deck
interface, premature failures occur. Such failures ultimately reflect poor
quality on Life Fitness exercise equipment instead of poor maintenance practice
on the customers’ part. Ideally, product maintenance should require as little
assistance as possible from the customer.</p>

<p>The project team decided to use ACE, a version of ARIZ, to tackle the
problem. A flow chart is provided to give a general outline of the ACE
algorithm.</p>
<i>
<p>Problem Statement:</p>
</i>
<p>The automatic wax dispensing system is designed to dispense a specified
volume of wax emulsion uniformly onto the underside of a treadmill belt. The
spray pattern is controlled by the nozzle orifice design and pump pressure. The
system consists of the wax emulsion, reservoir, peristaltic pump, tubing, spray
nozzle, and the spray command program (Figure 2). In order to transfer enough
solid paraffin wax onto the belt, wax emulsion was selected. However, this
emulsion has a tendency to induce clogging of the spray nozzle, thus disabling
the system function.</p>
<i>
<p>System Resources</p>
</i>
<p>Component Resources:</p>
<p>Wax emulsion, plastic reservoir, <b>peristaltic pump</b>, plastic tubing,
fittings, spray nozzle, <b>spray command program</b>, air, <b>water</b>, <b>wax</b>,
<b>emulsifier,</b> and belt.</p>
<b>
<p>Note: The items in bold are the key resources used in the solution.</p>
</b>
<p>Energetic Resources:</p>
<p>Electricity, pressure, gravity, velocity, surface tension force, heat, and
runner.</p>
<i>
<p>Contradictions</p>
<p>ExC-1:</i></p>
<p>If the percentage of wax in the emulsion is increased, then there is more
lubricant sprayed on the belt, but the spray nozzle will be clogged more often.</p>
<i>
<p>ExC-2:</i></p>
<p>If the percentage of wax in the emulsion is decreased, then the spray nozzle
will be clogged less often, but there is less lubricant sprayed on the belt.</p>
<i>
<p>Goal:</i></p>
<p>Find a way for the spray nozzle to clog less often and to provide more
lubricant sprayed on the belt.</p>
<i><u>
<p>Potential Solutions</p>
</u></i>
<p>After taking the problem through the extensive algorithm, the project team
came up with many potential solutions, three of which are listed below:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Move the pump closer to the spray nozzle to reduce pressure loss. Redesign
    the pump to spray emulsion and air at the end. The air spray will disrupt
    the surface tension of leftover emulsion, thus reducing emulsions left on
    the nozzle.</li>
  <b>
  <li>Design the nozzle so that the residue can be easily purged on the next
    spray. The nozzle design should allow a weak bridge to be built between the
    residue and the nozzle. The weak bridge will break away on the next spray
    with normal line pressure.</li>
  </b>
  <li>Polish the nozzle to reduce adhesion property.</li>
</ol>
<i>
<p>A Closer Analysis</p>
</i>
<p>Using 4M (Miniature Men), a brainstorming technique in ACE, both the wax
emulsion and wax residue are modeled as little men and analyzed.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="index.1.gif" width="499" height="300"><br>
Figure 4</p>
<sup></sup>
<p>First, the function of the emulsifier is identified; it is used to “grab”
both water and wax. Closer inspection shows that the wax residue contains only
emulsifier and wax. In order to suspend wax in water, water must be introduced
again. After looking at available system resources, the idea of “Prespray”
emerged. “Prespray” is a short burst of spray prior to the actual wax
dispensing spray, and it is used to introduce wax emulsion to the clogged
nozzle. The idea is to get the nozzle wet and let it “soak” for a period of
time. By wetting the nozzle and letting it “soak,” the tough residue of wax
and emulsifier will soften. During the actual wax dispensing spray, the nozzle
clears itself by pushing away the softened residue.</p>
<p>The mechanism at work is the affinity of emulsifier to both water and wax.
Emulsion leaves a tough residue of wax and emulsifier around the orifice of the
nozzle after it dries. When the dried residue comes in contact with a new supply
of emulsion, two things happen as the residue is “soaking” for a time
period. First, the emulsifier in the emulsion grabs onto wax residue and
emulsifies the wax residue. Second, and more importantly, the dried residue of
emulsifier and wax, still chemically attached, “suspends” or emulsifies in
the presence of water. The combination of two chemical interactions leads to the
softening of the residue. This cycle continues with each spray and the
lubrication delivery can then be maintained.</p>
<p>The Prespray solution uses only system resources and did not require
significant design change. The only modification was done through software. The
cost of this solution was the cost of making the software change, which was
minimal.</p>
<p>Some preliminary tests were performed using the concept of Prespray and the
results were very positive as all of the nozzles cleared themselves. Through
these preliminary tests, it was found that long soaking time and large Prespray
amounts contributed to better performance.</p>
<sup></sup><b>
<p>Design of Experiment Optimization</p>
</b>
<p>For field implementation, both the Prespray amount and soaking time must be
minimized. The Prespray amount must be minimized because excess wax can have
anti-lubricious property. For the system to spray wax, the belt must be moving
for the wax emulsion to be evenly distributed and prevent “puddling” and
leaking out. The soaking time must be minimized because the probability of
Prespray and the wax dispensing spray occurring during the same workout greatly
increases. A simple two-factor, three-level DOE was used, and three repetitions
were run for each of the nine settings.</p>

</sup>
<p>The output of the experiment is a numerical representation of how clogged the
nozzle is; the lower the number, the worse the nozzle clogging is. An output of
160 represents a no-clogging condition, where an output of 0 represents a
total-clogging condition. The data is then fed into DOE KISS, an analysis
software, and a solution space is generated.</p>

</font>Figure 5</p>
<p>Based on the solution space, a setting is picked. The selection criteria was
the lowest setting that produced a no-clogging condition. Confirmation trials
were run and the results conferred with the prediction of the solution space.
After successful field testing, the solution was put into production and named
EVERWAX<font face="Symbol">Ô</font>.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
</b>
<p>Using ACE (Algorithm for Conflict Elimination), a methodology derived from
ARIZ, in combination with DOE (Design of Experiment), Life Fitness Research
Engineering solved a long- standing design deficiency in the Commercial
Treadmill product line. The innovative feature, Everwax<font face="Symbol">ä</font>,
had virtually zero implementation cost because changes were only made in
software. Treadmill uptime is greatly increased because the maintenance
procedure of the lubrication system was reduced from once every three weeks to
an inspection every six months. Other analysis methodologies, such as DOE,
complement TRIZ and will play an important role in the advancement of TRIZ
practice and development.</p>
