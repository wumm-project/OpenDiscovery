<p>1. Introduction</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p>When a firm develops a new product, being needs-oriented is a quite important
viewpoint. If, however, product development puts too much emphasis on an
immediate sales increase only using tricky marketing tactics, there is a risk
that the reliability of the product itself will be hurt or the sales will end
after a one-time boom. (During the bubble economy in Japan, we saw many cases of
this kind of product development.)</p>
<p>Thus this paper proposes a practical activity process aimed at product
development, which suits the tide of technology evolution and can really impress
customers, while utilizing the Patterns of Evolution of Technological Systems.</p>
<p>Specifically the study in this paper tries to establish practical product
development, which combines Product Development VE (called “0 Look VE” and
“1st Look VE” in Japan) - aiming at highly valuable product development
based on a function-oriented concept - and the Patterns of Evolution of
Technological Systems.</p>
<p>The proposed process has been applied as a case study at Company S, a
Japanese housing manufacturer, and is introduced in this paper along with the
implemented results of that study. But first of all I would like to verify if
the proposed process itself is a method conforming to the paradigm of present
society.</p>
<p>Therefore, this paper shows that the perspectives of the Patterns of
Evolution of Technological Systems and VE, which are the basis of this proposed
process, conform to the direction of product development in the present society
before explaining the details of the proposed process.</p>

<p>2. Direction of Present Society and Product Development</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p>It is a matter of fact that engineers should develop high-quality (defect
free) products, and it is not just the recent trend that development of products
with a high level of customer satisfaction is expected. This phenomenon
represents a paradigm shift from the conventional industrial society mainly led
by corporations to the society with people priority. In other words, due to such
social change, customers also have transformed from just consumers to people who
put more emphasis on their life styles. Especially the dissemination of the
Internet available in the middle of 1990s (so-called IT revolution) has
drastically changed our way of life and increased the speed of this paradigm
shift.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, businesses recently seem to judge that they cannot
accurately grasp the present clienteles (or markets) just by the keyword:
improvement of customer satisfaction. So new words (keywords) for management
(especially in the marketing field) symbolizing this sharp paradigm shift were
born continuously. Chart 1 summarizes the new hot words with their definitions
including “customer satisfaction.”</p>

    <p align="left">Chart 1: New Words for Management (Especially Marketing)
    Symbolizing People-Priority Society</p>
    </font><font face="Times New Roman">
    <p>These new words seem to be born from the aspect of marketing activities
    as a means to realize customer satisfaction, but they re-draw the
    battle-lines of the conventional marketing thinking for the increase of
    sales and share. Considering how firms should incorporate customers into
    their side for the long-term and in stable condition will be a recent
    marketing trend.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, some new words show the direction of product development
    activities aiming at customer satisfaction + </font><font face="Symbol">a</font><font face="Times New Roman">
    (excitement and joy of the customers), like customer delight improvement
    activities. This term is used recently by Toyota-related companies
    (including suppliers) in Japan to show in the word, “delight” that they
    express the importance of product development based on the viewpoint of
    customers.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, however, if +</font><font face="Symbol">a</font><font face="Times New Roman">
    falls into activities converging into just extravagant design or addition of
    tricky function, such product development is a bubble type, and long-term
    incorporation of customers in a stable condition cannot be expected.</p>
    <p>So product development activities suitable for the people-priority
    society - utilizing the Product Development VE aiming at improvement of
    product value and the Patterns of Evolution of Technological Systems
    determining the product development suitable for the times - came up my mind
    as effective product development activities, which conform to the original
    intentions of these new words (especially the concept of customer
    satisfaction, and that of customer delight, an evolved concept of customer
    satisfaction).</p>
    </font><font face="MS Mincho" lang="JA"></font><font face="Times New Roman">
    <p>The Product Development VE is well utilized mainly by Japanese
    manufacturers as an powerful tool for achieving customer satisfaction aimed
    at the realization of customer required functions while considering the
    economical balance. During the bubble economy period, however, they made
    mistakes such as overemphasizing of too wild designs (attractive functions)
    and addition of tricky functions (multifunctional). I think of combining the
    Patterns of Evolution of Technological Systems in TRIZ and the Product
    Development VE as an effective measure to complement such weakness of VE and
    to suggest correct direction of product development.</p>
    <p>The relations about this process is summarized in Chart 2.</p>

    <p>Then, sort out these ideas for each function area by individual

    <p>Determine the concept design scenario with high priority after a

    to sufficiently anticipate what result will be brought if the scenario is
    actually implemented utilizing experience and knowledge (expertise) so far.
    The countermeasures against individual defects must combine expertise of
    team members so that technical or economical defects can be overcame. But in
    this case a more efficient review of defect countermeasures utilizing IPS
    (Inventive Problem Solving) of IWB was tried during this stage. (For the
    detailed explanation of this point, refer to my paper presented in TRIZCON
    2000.)</p>
    <p>As a result, we determined that the concept design scenario of the
    cleaning ability improvement type is optimal and has high feasibility.</p>

<p>7. Conclusion</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p>In this way this paper has introduced the method of combining the Patterns of
Evolution of Technological Systems of TRIZ (in reality DE steps developed by
Ideation were heavily used) and Product Development VE (Japanese-style VE after
all) as practical steps suitable for present product development activities. As
a result of the case study conducted at Company S, we received an evaluation
where the highly effective design scenario could be developed and lead to the
contract of full-scale project consultation utilizing of these practical steps.</p>
<p>As this result proves, the combination of the Patterns of Evolution of
Technological Systems and Product Development VE is effectively practical. In
the future we hope to refine these practical steps and sophisticate them into
more effective product development technique.</p>
