<p align="JUSTIFY">“Worryingly…a significant number of Irish food companies
are not actively developing any new food products, while many that are engaged
in new product development do not explicitly involve consumers in their research”
(DeBurca and Ledwith 2000: 30).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The 40 inventive principles can be an aid to new product
development. The question that this article attempts to answer is: Are the 40
inventive principles relevant to new food product development and innovation?
This article examines selected, relatively innovative food products that exhibit
one or more of the inventive principles. It also highlights other inventive
principles that may assist food product development and some that are less
relevant.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Food Product Innovation</b>:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Innovation in the food product comes in two forms:</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Food Packaging innovations:</p>
</u>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">new packaging materials that improve product shelf-life,
    freshness and quality.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">new packaging that presents the food product in new and
    different ways (i.e. new packaging shapes, new graphic design etc).</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">new packaging that increases product versatility (i.e.
    packaging that can be used in the microwave and the oven).</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">new packaging that increase ease of use (i.e. milk carton
    designs that are easily opened).</li>
</ul>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Food Product innovations</u>:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Where the foodstuff itself is new or innovative in some way:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">new ethnic concepts.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Organic foods and health foods</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Fortification (i.e. addition of vitamins, minerals,
    bacterial cultures).</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Prepared meals.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">new manufacturing techniques that improve sensory
    qualities such as minimal processing, heat treatments, freeze-drying etc.</li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The lists above are by no means extensive, however they do
give a good idea of what form innovations can take in new food product
development. According to Mitchell (1997:15) food companies “should worry much
more about business and marketing strategies in terms of <i>what</i> new
products they want to make and <i>why</i> they want to make them rather than <i>how</i>
the products will be made as the technology is almost available”. So, the idea
generation stage- involving a multi-functional team (food technologists,
marketing etc.), is an extremely important step in the development of a new food
product and it is at this stage that the 40 inventive principles could find
application in focusing and assisting brainstorming sessions. The following
section examines selected innovative food products that exhibit one or more of
the 40 inventive principles in order to illustrate their relevance to food
product development.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Food Products exhibiting one or more of the 40 inventive
principles:</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Take the example of ‘Muller Fruit Corner’. It is
basically a yoghurt product, however the fruit <b>Figure 1.1</b>: Yoghurt
Product innovation exhibiting inventive principles 1 and 2:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="02.gif" width="550" height="213"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">puree has been ‘TAKEN OUT’ (Principle 2) of the yoghurt
and the food packaging has been ‘SEGMENTED’ (Principle 1) (See Fig: 1.1).
The sensory characteristics are not hugely different to a traditional yoghurt
product- most people mix the fruit puree with the natural yoghurt on opening the
product anyway. What the manufacturer has done, however, is to present the
product to the consumer in a way that offers a choice regarding how the product
is consumed - either mix at the start, mix at each spoonful, or eat separately -
and as such may be seen as offering distinct ‘mass customization’ (see also
Mann/Domb) directed innovation advantage.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Using the inventive principles this type of innovative food
product could have been quickly developed. This method can also lead to further
product differentiation. For example, Principle 1: Segmentation could be
interpreted as: Why not introduce two, complimentary, segmented fruit puree
flavours into the yoghurt product? (i.e. Principle 1. C. Increase the degree of
fragmentation or segmentation), or possibly add a third type of product (e.g. a
topping, or textured ‘crumble’). Alternatively we can look to other
inventive principles such as Principle 7: Nestled Doll- instead of placing the
puree and natural yoghurt why not place puree inside the yoghurt, in a circular
container within the package.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Another example is Goldenvale’s ‘Cheesestring’ product,
an innovative reshape of a traditional product to make it more attractive to
children, exhibits inventive principle 4: ASYMMETRY, the changing of the shape
of an object from symmetrical (i.e. basic cheese block) to asymmetrical (i.e.
the cheesestring) (See Fig: 1.2).</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Figure 1.2:</b> Cheese product innovation exhibiting
inventive principle 1:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="1" src="03.gif" width="550" height="188"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The ‘Push-Pop’ product, an innovative take on children’s
lollipops, exhibits principle 7. NESTED DOLL, where the actual lollipop product
is placed within a plastic container. The lollipop can then be pushed above the
plastic container to be consumed (See Figure 1.3). Again the product is
innovative without any major focus on sensory characteristics (the lollipop
tastes similar to many other products).</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Figure 1.3</b>: Push Pop product exhibiting Principle 7:
Nested Doll</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="04.gif" width="550" height="167"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Looking more to the processing of the food, another example
of the Inventive Principles in action is the ‘crinkle-cut’ potato chip shown
in Figure 1.4. The crinkle-cut crisp allows the consumer to insert more crisp
into the mouth (assuming one is of a mind to eat them singly) with more surface
area than a plain-cut chip. The solution uses Inventive Principle 17, ANOTHER
DIMENSION (which, incidentally is one of the Principles suggested from the
Matrix for the volume versus area contradiction the crinkle-cut crisp solves).</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Figure 1.4</b>: Plain-cut versus Crinkle-Cut Potato Chip</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><img src="Image210b.gif" width="550" height="261"></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Ketchup and other sauce containers have also been the focus
of significant changes in packaging in recent times. Perhaps most noticeable has
been a shift away from glass containers to squeezable, thin-walled plastic
containers. We might see this as Principle 35 PARAMETER CHANGES in action
(Principle 35c -‘change the degree of flexibility’), and that it comes as
recommended solutions to both the Loss of Substance versus Device Complexity and
Duration of Action versus Use of Energy (i.e. the amount of time it takes to
shake the sauce out of the bottle versus the vigorous shaking action required
with a conventional bottle) contradictions.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Also related to product dispensers, Principle 1 SEGMENTATION
may be seen to be used a lot. We see it most obviously in things like striped
toothpaste (a concept which appears not to have been adopted in other foodstuffs
yet - e.g. cheese spreads, spreadable pate, etc), in TV dinners, and the
incorporation of multiple dispenser holes into things like herb dispensers where
the consumer may wish to vary the flow rate of the product. Such variable
dispensers also make use of Principle 15, DYNAMICS and as such allow the user to
switch from one dispensing mode to another.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">So from the examples previously cited the inventive
principles do describe adequately these food product innovations. However, these
food innovations represent only a minuscule amount of new food products
introduced onto the marketplace every year. What of the other inventive
principles? The following section highlights other inventive principles that may
be useful in the food product development process.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Other useful inventive principles in food product
development:</p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Other inventive principles that could assist in innovative
food product development include:</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Principle 1</u>: Segmentation: Many examples and
opportunities for product packaging innovations make use of Segmentation.
Segmentation is particularly relevant in instances where the manufacturer is
looking for simple ways of allow consumers to customize products to their
personal needs. ‘Salt-n-Shake’ potato chips, for example, contain a separate
sachet of salt in order that the consumer can decide exactly how much salt they
apply to the chips (why hasn’t this been extended to other flavours yet?). ‘Multi-packs’
offer another form of segmentation where the consumer is given customizing
options to use only a part of the product at one time depending on the number of
servings required.</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Principle 5:</u> Merging: This could be interpreted as the
merging of two similar or complimentary flavours, for example the Cadbury’s
Marble product, where milk and white chocolate are brought together. This
principle could also be interpreted as bringing complimentary products together-
for example DairyLee Lunchable products where crackers, ham and cheese are
brought together in the same packaging.</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Principle 6:</u> Universality: Eliminate the need for other
parts: The inclusion of small fold-out spoons in M&amp;S prepared salads (this
is also Principle 15 Dynamics in action)</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Principle 10:</u> Preliminary action: Pre-cooked meals and
meats, de-seeded vegetables are good examples of this very commonly applied food
industry principle in action.</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Principle 9</u>: Preliminary anti-action: also common in food
related products, desiccation processes such as custard powders - where the
consumer gets the advantage of less weight to carry home but the down-side of
having to re-hydrate. The emergence of dried herb-mixes (often consumer
blendable) for dip-based products is a recent new use of this Principle.</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Principle 11:</u> Beforehand Cushioning: used in a variety of
products where possible tampering presents a consumer threat. Pressurised ‘click-lids’
on baby food containers are perhaps the most commonly observed examples of this
Principle in action. Other possibilities include use of age-chromic labels to
more effectively inform consumers when a product has passed a ‘best by’
date, paper labels shaped so that they cover the lid and rip if the lid is
opened, or double lids (e.g. in cottage cheese tubs).</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Principle 17:</u> Another Dimension: used in pyramid-shaped
tea-bags (‘in order to allow better circulation of tea-leaves in the pot’).</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Principle 25</u>: Self-service: the emerging range of ‘self-heating’
and ‘self-cooling’ food containers demonstrate good examples of Principle 25
in action.</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Principle 31:</u> Porous materials: An excellent example of a
food product exhibiting this principle is Polo Mints/Lifesavers - by putting a
hole in the middle of the sweet the manufacturer has created a new and very
recognisable food product. Porous materials is also used frequently in the
manufacture of chocolate bars - in which the manufacturer gets to sell less
chocolate in a product that looks like it contains more than it actually does
(although, they would claim, the porosity improves texture and rate of taste
transfer to the tongue). Drink sachets containing a foaming agent (e.g. packet
cappuccino) are also examples of Porous Materials in action.</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Principle 32</u>: Colour changes: This principle almost seems
too simple. However colour changes of food packaging can be an important method
of differentiating one food product from another. For example a Crisp products’
flavour in Ireland is easily identified- green for cheese and onion, and blue
for salt and vinegar. That was until Walkers Crisps introduced their product
onto the shelves- completely reversing the colour trend. Other examples of the
importance of colour in product development are sausage and cheese products.
Consumers expect certain sausage and cheese products to be a certain colour. The
Colour Changes Principle is used in another way on beer labels printed with a
thermochromic ink - whereby the label changes colour when the beer is at the
manufacturers recommended drinking temperature.</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Principle 35:</u> Parameter changes: This principle could be
interpreted as using liquid fillings in sweets instead of a solid filling, such
as chocolate liqueurs or bubble gum products will gel or flavoured liquid
fillings. Change the amount of real oranges in orange juice to improve taste,
increase thickness of sauce to improve ‘home made’ quality (Change
consistency or concentration). Principle 35 is increasingly being used in food
packaging, particularly with regards to a shift from tins to plastic containers
for ever higher shelf-life products. Anyone that has struggled trying to open a
corned beef tin longs for the day when this product will be packaged in an easy
to open plastic container.</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Principle 36:</u> Phase Transition: obvious in many frozen
products, but still offering possible opportunities for new product innovations.
‘Herb-ice-cubes’ containing freshly chopped herbs is a recent innovation in
specialised food outlets in the UK presents one such opportunity.</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Principle 39</u>: Strong Oxidants: not immediately obvious,
but interpreted as ‘activated’ products, Principle 39 is seen most obviously
in fizzy drinks, and less obviously in ‘exploding’ chocolate bars.</p>
<u>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Principle 40:</u> Composite Materials: the concept of
combining foods with different properties into a single structure is present in
cereal bars, filled pasta, multi-vitamins, ‘bubble-and-squeak’, and a wide
variety of other products, particularly those where the consumer is looking for
convenience of use - cereal bars are increasingly been sold as ‘wholesome,
balanced breakfast meal on the move’ products.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">From the list above, the 40 inventive principles can help
food product developers in generating new concepts at the idea generation stage.
There is an obvious need for research into all of the principles and how they
can be applied to new food products. There are also some principles that may
have to added, for example- Fortification: The addition of a nutritional
improving factor, or Ethnicity: The reinterpretation of a traditional product
with ethnic twists- both concepts are being utilised in food product development
today. Through use, application and research the 40 inventive principles and the
contradiction matrix could become a valuable aid to food developers in the
future. Let the research commence!</p>
