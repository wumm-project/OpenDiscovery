<b>
<p>1. Introduction</p>
</b>
<p>This paper continues a series about the research work that is being
undertaken at the Center of Design and Product Innovation at the Monterrey
Institute of Technology (Mexico), looking for the integration of different
design tools and methodologies to increase design effectiveness and
productivity.</p>
<p>An integrated model of the Conceptual Design Process was presented at TRIZCON’99,
which is based on integrating QFD, Functional Analysis and TRIZ [1]. Now some
theoretic reflections about the integration of TRIZ and CAD are presented with
the objective to contribute to make this integration possible in a near future.</p>
<p>It is intended to contribute to a reduction in product development time and
to an improvement in quality and performance by creating the groundwork for
integrating interactions between product development tools and methods, thereby
allowing the exploration of alternatives.</p>
<p>Especially the integration between 3D Modeling CAD packages and TRIZ based
Computer Aided Inventing Software could enhance the creativity needed for
developing and improving products.</p>
<b>
<p>2. Background and state of the art</p>
</b>
<p>The product development process may be defined as the complex system of
activities that produces the information required for bringing products to
manufacture.</p>
<p>Therefore the design process is an information generating process, which
starts with an abstract and often uncertain and confuse description of a new
needed product performance. Based on this description a design team first
creates the concepts and then the embodiment and detailed design required for
manufacturing the product intended to satisfy the new need.</p>
<p>Very often during the design process information remains uncertain until
design decisions are taken which allow going further and gathering new
information derived from analysis or experiment done on the newly created
models. This causes the design process to be iterative and recursive: that means
going forward with uncertain information until the uncertainty may be overcome
with information obtained through analysis of the recently created models. The
designer may then continue or go back to the point where the uncertainty arise
and redefine the decision about shapes, dimensions, physical principles,
parameters, tolerances, etc. This traditional trial and error approach is
expensive and time consuming.</p>
<p>Efficiently and effectively supporting the design process with computational
tools and methods is limited due to the lack of integration of the methods and
tools used.</p>
<p>Different software packages are commonly used to work on the required design
tasks along the whole design process, as for example text processors; search
engines; equations solvers and spread sheets; QFD software; drawing, drafting
and painting tools; 3D-CAD packages; PDM and database managing tools; CAE
software. Computer Aided Inventing tools based on TRIZ, are computer tools that
have been used more often in the last years.</p>
<p>Although each of them is very useful, its lack of integration increases cycle
time, while the knowledge burden on the designer keeps augmenting as more
materials and more options become available.</p>
<p>After the Conceptual Design Process follows the Embodiment Design Process and
a much bigger amount of decisions have to be taken at this stage. For example,
Eppinger [2] has indicated that a copier redesign requires 400 people, 125
subassemblies, 2,000 engineering drawings, and over a million decisions. He has
conducted a project named Information-Based Product Development and, from his
point of view, product development information exchange today is more like a
batch than a continuous process, as individuals or teams generate blocks of
information which, only when complete, are passed along to those who need them.
He says this leads to substantial delays.</p>
<p>Another statement supporting this view states that: “Complex products can
contain millions of dimensions and characteristics (voltages, forces, etc.) each
of which impact the performance of the product. However, only a small few of the
millions of features, the Key Characteristics of the product, will significantly
affect the final quality, performance, and cost of the product.” [3]</p>
<p>The annual Software Tools Symposium organized and facilitated by Finch [4]
provided a forum for the sharing of both existing software tools and concepts
for potential tools that arise from research. People from MIT, industry, and
software developing companies came together to discuss how to adapt innovative
ideas and tools from academic research into marketable products that American
industry can use.</p>
<p>Chang [5] developed a new input method for conceptual design of mechanical
assemblies that enables users to easily explore design concepts and design
function by function not component by component. Unlike input methods in current
CAD systems, his method enables users to input partial geometry and group it
according to its functionality.</p>
<p>Flowers et. al. [6] conducted the project “Visualizing relationships in
large information databases”, that was aimed to represent primarily textual
information in a spatial context to take advantage of human visual processing
skills. The databases used as case studies in this work include the patent
database, the science citation index, and product development databases such as
those used in tolerance buildup or identification of key characteristics.</p>
<p>Whitney et. al. [7], conducted the project “Information flow mapping to aid
design of complex products”, looking for a better scale up of knowledge-based
engineering (KBE) workstations, for products like cars and planes, which are
complex and require coordination of many people and exchange of a lot of
information. They are intended to be able to improve the effectiveness of
product development projects by understanding the influence of information flow
patterns, inherent in the product itself, on the way work is done.</p>
<p>Seering et. al. [8] are working on the concurrent application of tools, in
order that these tools might be applied to the same product development program.
Their objective is to develop an integrated demonstration of multiple tools
applied to a single design problem that enables to identify differences and
conflicts in the underlying assumptions of individual approaches.</p>
<p>The authors expect through this project to create a better understanding of
the synergies and conflicts among tools and methodologies when applied to a
single product development program.</p>
<p>Schön [9] expresses that during the design process a person needs be able to
easily create a visual representation, even for abstract and verbal ideas, and
then respond to it perceptually to discover new arrangements and shapes
representing new ideas. The new concepts emerge from the visual representation.</p>
<p>The research question is how interactive systems can aid users in quickly
creating and manipulating visual representations and whether they can support
the discovery of new relationships, structures, and meanings in the materials.</p>
<p>Mitchell [10] points out that &quot;... design is not description of what is,
it is exploration of what might be. Drawings are valuable precisely because they
are rich in suggestions of what might be.” He argues that designers frequently
recognize emergent subshapes and subsequently structure their understanding of
the design and their reasoning about it in terms of emergent entities and
relationships -ones that they never explicitly input.</p>
<p>The whole purpose of the act of drawing might be seen to be in order to look
at the result. In Gombrich's [11] discussion of Leonardo's creative process he
suggested that: &quot;in searching for a new solution Leonardo projected new
meanings into the forms he saw in his old discarded sketches.&quot;</p>
<p>It is helpful to view the action process of drawing as quite independent of
the perception process of looking. Reflection upon a design problem may lead to
a drawing activity based upon a given structure that, through perception,
generates emergent shapes that offer alternative structures to reflect upon.</p>
<p>The question may be: Is it possible to perform this activity without “looking”?
Is it possible to perform automatically a drawing activity based upon a given
structure, that generates new shapes which lead to alternative structures, which
in turn lead to new structures and so on? The key question may be, how to “know”
when the new structure matches the desired constrains?</p>
<p>The entity of a drawing might be thought of as a visual image together with
an associated verbal description that imposes structure upon it. From this
perspective, an emergent shape occurs when a revised description, or structure
is discovered. The drawing looks the same but the verbal or structural
description of it is new. In this case the new “structural description” is
based on the recognition of “new” properties that had not been recognized
yet.</p>
<p>Tann [12] tackles emergence, in the context of the use of line drawings in
design, by formulating higher-level line descriptors, in terms of construction
lines. The workshop addressed the issue of emergent shapes: the perception of
shapes in a drawing that do not directly correspond to entities used to
construct that drawing.</p>
<p>Stiny [13] describes four functions that can produce emergent shapes rather
in the manner of a generative grammar. The basic strategy is, then, to take a
drawing as described in its construction process, and to transform that
description into an intermediate representation that enables the generation of
emergent shapes. It was reported by Scrivener et al [14], that drawings
considered in their bitmap, or pixel array, representation rather than the
standard structural one were amenable to poststructuring. In other words,
techniques were illustrated that could be used to impose structures on such a
drawing that differed from the structures used to construct it. From this work,
a considerable body of work has been undertaken in the development of a
computational model of certain perceptual activities [15]. More recently
attention has been given to how one might interact with drawings in which
emergent shapes are perceived. The question here is how might the user
economically indicate an emergent shape to the computer in order to manipulate
it.</p>
<p>AID'96 was looking for papers on representations of visual information and
reasoning processes on such representations that have played a very significant
role in design problem solving and designers' reasoning. Compared to other types
of problem solving activities, design is unique in the extent of use of visual
representations. However, CAD tools merely make the creation of visual
representations easy, but do not provide leverage on issues such as design
reasoning.</p>
<p>It may be concluded that, from the CAD point of view, the research work has
to uncover the semantics of models for design representations and how can such
semantics may be represented in the computer and used in ways to intelligently
assist the designer.</p>
<p>Following questions has to be addressed:</p>
</p><ul>
  <li>How can cognitive models of visual representation and reasoning in design
    help in generating new visual/spatial/geometric information?</li>
  <li>What kinds of new designer-computer interactions might support aiding the
    designer in generation/emergence of new shapes and interpreting such
    representations?</li>
</ul>
<b>
<p>3. TRIZ and Product design</p>
</b>
<p>TRIZ has proved to be a very strong tool in helping to solve difficult
technical problems that requires inventive thinking; that means problems where
one or more technical contradictions are involved and which do not have known
ways or means of solution.</p>
<p>TRIZ is not originally a tool that belongs to the classical product design
methodologies and its place in the product design process has yet to be better
identified in order to increase its efficiency. Some work has been already
undertaken in this direction by Savransky [16] and Arciszewski and Zlotin [17].</p>
<p>Although not yet a comprehensive approach for the integration has been
established and further work is being undertaken, several opportunities of
synergy and need of improvement have been recognized between TRIZ and the
embodiment design process.</p>
<p>It is known that useful ideas may be derived from the use of the
contradiction matrix, during the conceptual design stage but less experience has
been achieved in using the Contradiction Matrix during the embodiment design
process. One possible way may be implementing some inventive principles more
related to product design as segmentation, local quality, asymmetry, joining,
nesting, counterweight, previous action, mediator combined with parameters of
geometric nature as length of moving object, length of stationary object, area
of moving object, area of stationary object, volume of moving object, volume of
stationary object, weight of moving object, weight of stationary object to be
used during the embodiment design process.</p>
<p>Furthermore the Matrix may be enhanced with solution principles that are
often used to solve design problems but are not yet included in the matrix, as
for example increasing the inertial moment of structural sections to solve the
technical contradiction between strength and weight.</p>
<p>Other authors [18, 19] have recognized the need to enhance the Contradiction
Matrix with new parameters and inventive principles that improve the success
rate in using this tool. In our Center, further work is being developed in this
direction.</p>
<p>It is known that SUH diagrams are widely used during the conceptual design
stage, because they allow an extensive analysis of the possible solutions in
order to increase Ideality.</p>
<p>Several modules in TechOptimizer (TO) are aimed to improve the product design
as the Product Analysis Module that is mainly based on the functional
decomposition and analysis of the products to be improved, to clarify what may
be improved. The Trimming and Feature Transfer Modules help to complete the
Product Analysis module by eliminating components or features of a product but
maintaining its useful functions unaffected or improved or eliminating harmful
side effects. The feature transfer module helps in transferring functions from
one component or feature to another that requires improvement.</p>
<p>The product improvement process in TechOptimizer is supported with an
extensive physical effects database, that helps in finding alternative physical
ways of performing needed functions. However TO does not have an interface to
CAD systems and therefore its recommendations has to be translated from
designers in the CAD packages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>4. Ways and methods</p>
</b>
<p>Our approach involves identifying the relationships and role of textual and
graphic information, during the product development process in an integrated
context. The goal is to take advantage of both types of information
representations. It is known that human visual processing skills are used to
uncover relationships that arise when shapes and dimensions are combined into
new design solutions. On the other side the rapidly developing computer
searching and combining capabilities based on textual information may be used in
semantic processors for creating new design concepts.</p>
<p>The new information generated during the design problem solving process may
occur through <b>finding</b>, <b>creation</b> or a <b>combination of both</b>.
Generation of new design information based on finding takes place during the
adaptation of solutions gathered together based on search systems.</p>
<p>Generation of new design information based on creation takes place for
example during the refinement of embodiment and detailing design, as new shapes
and concepts representing new ideas emerge as response to perceptions and
discovering, based on the human visual processing and abstraction skills. This
is the case when computer aided modeling tools as (CAD) and Simulation software
(CAE) are used to represent shapes and/or to analyze behaviors. Based on the
graphical representation of the results, human designers are able to create,
identify or infer new solutions.</p>
<p>Another case of design information generated through creation takes place
during automated design or optimization processes. In these cases the new
information created, is mostly a new combination of parameters based on
invariant design concepts.</p>
<p>Generation of new design information based on the combination of finding and
creation is the most complex type. This takes place for example when new
qualitative solutions suggested through TRIZ tools are combined with the
information generated based on emerging shapes and concepts during the
embodiment and detailed design process.</p>
<p>The aim of our new approach is finding a way of integrating TRIZ based tools
with 3D-CAD packages to provide designers help during the design process. This
means providing this help just at the time designers are interacting with the
user interface of 3D-CAD systems trying to find a design solution for a
performance requirement without having to change their design environment.</p>
<b>
<p>4.1. Solution requirements</p>
</b>
<p>As design models are mainly of graphic nature and TRIZ tools concepts are
mainly formulated in textual form, the integrated tools and methods should
enable designers to interact with the graphic design interface of the CAD
package being processed and when needed, finding TRIZ-based recommendations as
directions of solutions.</p>
<p>Ideally the use of TRIZ based tools should be directly applied to the product
model that is being developed. This means that ways should be found and/or
developed to convert graphical and text information easily into each other and
to identify relations between both types of information representation.</p>
<b>
<p>4.2 The object oriented 3D-CAD tree-structured graph.</p>
</b>
<p>In Figs. 1 and 2 is shown how objects modeled in 3D-CAD packages are related
to the object oriented tree-structured graph (TSG) of its components. These TSGs
contain the information about geometric shape, dimensions and topology of the
objects, from which the parts and assemblies are modeled, therefore each
component of a 3D parametric model may be accessed through textual information
for edition or deletion.</p>
<p>For example for individual parts or components following items may be
accessed through textual information of its TSG: the shape of its parametric
profiles, its parameters, the relative position of the construction planes and
the boolean and unit operations (join, cut, intersect, fillet, chamfer, etc)
used to model each the part.</p>
<p>In case of assemblies or subassemblies the relative position and the way
components or subassemblies are joined together is also accessible through the
TSGs.</p>
<b>
<p>4.3. The Object-Action-Object-Result-Diagrams</p>
</b>
<p>Diagrams are commonly used problem solving tools, as they allow focusing the
attention on the key information required when analyzing and solving problems.
Specialized diagrams, as SF- and SUH diagrams and bond graphs are examples of
how diagrams help in conceptualizing and visualizing the required information.</p>
<p>As objects in 3D-CAD models<b> </b>are represented in TSGs it is possible to
add to its TSGs information about the way each component interact with each
other (<b>actions) </b>and about the <b>results </b>obtained through this
actions. Adding actions and results information to the TSGs a new type of
Diagarams, the Object-action-object-result diagrams (O<sup>2</sup>-A-R-Diagrams),
are obtained.</p>
<p>In Fig.3 an example of an O2-A-R-Diagram is shown, where the constituting
objects O1-O6 may be seen with their geometric or topological relationships (GTi-j)
and the functional actions among them as Ai-j arrows. The Results objects are
linked with Ri arrows outgoing from the objects. A detailed description of the
O2-A-R -Diagrams is contained in [20].</p>

Fig. 3 Example of an O2-A-R-Diagram</p>
<p>O2-A-R-Diagrams are the main way in which product model information may be
related to TRIZ based analysis tools for helping in finding solutions to design
problems.</p>
<p>In O2-A-R-Diagrams an <b>object</b> is any physical component in a technical
system, independently of its level of complexity in the system. That means that
any technical system may be decomposed in objects, which may also again be
decomposed in more simple objects, until a level is reached where the
decomposition is no further possible or necessary. The decomposition of a
technical system in objects is a logical process. This means that not only
physically separable components may be decomposed, but also components which are
physically inseparable, may also be logically decomposed in its building
features.</p>
<p>Based on this a car model may be decomposed in several first level subsystems
of the car (tier one), which constitute objects (assemblies) in a CAD-System.
These are i.e. the steel body, the engine, the axles, and the transmission,
among others. Each of these complex assemblies may be handled as a simple object
which my again be decomposed into subassemblies. For example the engine may be
divided in the starter system, the fuel injection, the cylinder head with
valves, the crankshaft-connecting rod-piston subsystem and others. Each of these
subassemblies may be further decomposed in parts and each part as i.e. the
connecting rod may again be decomposed in its several constituting features from
which it is modeled. The features are constituted of profiles, planes,
dimensions, tolerances, etc. which, are also handled as objects in CAD systems.</p>
<p>O2-A-R-Diagrams are compatible with the TSGs of most important commercial
3D-CAD packages and are the basis for a software based user interface being
developed which starts from the 3D-CAD TSG and allows relevant functional
information (actions) to be added between each interacting object par (O2) for
providing results (R). This approach resembles the way CAE software works, where
additional actions as forces, velocities, accelerations are added to the
existing objects in order to obtain simulation results as stress maps, velocity
diagrams, etc.</p>
<p>The difference is that in this case no simulation is performed, as the aim of
this approach is not to simulate but to look for new design solutions. The
O2-A-R -Diagrams are appropriate for being processed with semantic processors to
derive recommendations of solution concepts for each kind of insufficient or
harmful actions or results contained in the diagram. As new design solutions are
commonly searched through variation of shape, dimensions, topology, position,
number of elements or its mechanical properties, directions of solutions should
be presented graphically at the CAD display in order to help designers to
overcome psychological inertia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font></sup>
<p>4.4. Further work with O2-A-R -Diagrams</p>
</b>
<p>Automatically formulating design solutions with O2-A-R -Diagrams requires yet
following tasks to be completed:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Establishing a set of rules to be applied to typical situations of
  insufficient or harmful actions or results contained in O2-A-R -Diagrams as a
  subset of the inventive principles and/or standard solutions.</p>
  <p>Building the interface for modifying the TSG in CAD systems in order that
  recommended directions of solution automatically appear as modifications to
  the 3D-CAD model to allow designers visually identify emergent shapes that
  reflect alternative structures to reflect upon.</p>
  <p>As only few of the inventive principles and standard solutions are of
  geometrical, dimensional or topological nature, further rules derived from the
  best practices in embodiment design have to be implemented to enrich the rule
  set.</p>
  <b>
  </blockquote>
  <p>4.5. Some possible cases</p>
</b>
<p>In table II are shown several examples of the kind of recommendations that
may be formulated by the semantic processing Design Advisor:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A first set of recommendations may be derived from those inventive
  principles that contain more geometric nature as segmentation, local quality,
  asymmetry, joining, nesting, counterweight, previous action, mediator,
  equipontentiality</p>
  <p>A second set of recommendations may be obtained from the morphological
  matrix, in terms of changing position, shape, number and type of movement and
  also derived from DFMA practices in terms of merging parts, eliminating bolts,
  etc.</p>
  <p>A third set or recommendations are of the kind of the recommendations
  derived from SUH diagrams at IWB or from the Product Analysis, Feature
  Transfer or Trimming modules in TO.</p>
