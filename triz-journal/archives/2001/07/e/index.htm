</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">We can illustrate the advantages of
teaching enlarged TRIZ for the large public by numerous testimonials attesting
to its value from our former learners of the program “Creativity Methodologies”
(CM). Our Center for Scientific and Technical Creativity (CSTC) has had
thousands of such reports. In this section of the current paper we have taken
some fragments from them:</font></p>

I am a high school student I cannot take full advantage of this subject. However
it helps me to study more effectively. The benefits from the course are quite
significant.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">… After the course in Creativity
Methodologies, I stopped thinking unsystematically. Instead, I began to use
Creativity Methodologies, and have a more comprehensive view of any problem. I
plan optimal steps for solving math problems, anticipate potential problems.</font></p>

the more I learned the more interested I became. I was surprised to find that my
thinking had improved greatly.</font></p>

difficult problems thanks to my ability to ask questions and look at all aspects
of those problems.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">… The subject has made me more confident

if I apply what I have learned in my future job.</font></p>

Methodologies are beneficial to me not only in dealing with problems. When I was
still at school, I used to be punished for fighting with my classmates. If I had
learned this subject then and been able to reason, using the nine-systems
thinking display, I would not have resorted to violence. Not long ago, while I
was enjoying some coffee with a few friends of mine, I was confronted by a group
of local youths. I immediately thought of the nine-systems thinking display: if
I had had a fight with them, I would have either been bitten by the youths or
arrested by the police for causing public nuisance. At the same time I
remembered the principles of Convert Harm into Benefit and Transition into a New
Dimension. I took the initiative to shake hands with them and offer them some
coffee. As a result, the conflict was solved positively. This method turned out
to be better than violence. In my view, my response to this situation can be
regarded as an example of creative thinking for myself.</font></p>

</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">I</font></b><font FACE="Arial"> have known
for many years that I didn't have an effective method in thinking. Faced with a
problem, I found myself very slow in working out a solution, as compared to
other people. I always had to grope about step by step, feeling completely at a
loss, not knowing what to do to solve the problem. I could not concentrate on
anything, and often left things halfdone.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">Now that the course is coming to an end, I
find myself completely changed from what I was before. The lack of
self-confidence and the inertia in my nature have given way to optimism,
observation, and inquisitiveness. My mind has been sharpened and become more
alert, enabling me to find the solution to a problem more quickly, effectively
and economically. What I like most in the course is that for every point
presented in a lesson, the instructor always gave us illustrations taken from
daily life, besides mentioning the inventions in which the method was used. I
also like his humanistic approach to teaching.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">I regret not having been able to attend
this course earlier, which made me waste a lot of my time. The subject is
necessary for everybody, and should be included in the curriculum for high
schools.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">Company Fujitsu sent over 210 Vietnamese
to Japan for training. After they had been in Japan for a while, once a week the
company arranged for some of them to talk with their families via television
bridge. Once there was a technical problem: the participants could only see one
another's faces without any sound. Our manager had decided to postpone the
meeting. This meant that the families should return home and come back in a
week. Among them there were many from very far provinces. Remembering the point
&quot;Using the intrinsic resources inherent in the given system&quot;
(principle Self-service) in the CM course, I came up with an idea: participants
talk on the international telephone of Fujitsu's net while seeing one another on
the television screen. All trainees and their families were happy. Because of
this, I also felt happy.</font></p>

lessons from which I learned a wide range of thinking techniques (40 principles
and methods) that I can apply in solving socio-economic problems. I have found
that these techniques are essential to daily activities. Creativity
Methodologies help me to identify my shortcomings, in particular, psychological
inertia, performing jobs by rote, lack of initiatives. I have been trying to get

can save more time for more work. Now whatever work I take charge of, big or
small, I view it as a problem. I use the new methods to solve it and I can do it
faster. Good-bye to my old-fashioned way (the trial and error method). In my
hospital, I have reorganized the rooms and medical devices, giving each of them
more functions (the principle of Universality) without ill affecting the

cart, and then carry it to a steam-heated furnace. In fact the workers were able
to handle a load of 70 kg (because 100 kg is too heavy for them), short of 30
kg. I applied the following principles: &quot;Continuity of Useful Action&quot;,
&quot;Dynamicity&quot;, &quot;Segmentation&quot; and &quot;Consolidation&quot;.
The container was divided into two separate parts, with 50 kg product for each.

turned into one container to be fitted to the furnace's power. Thus, the
container always holds the content of 100 kg without any waste.</font></p>

has helped us to realize how harmful it is to think without orientation, to do
things from habits and by trial-and-error. In our case, it is even worse because
we are teachers, whose duty is to train students to be creative (as we had been
asked by our teachers) without ever asking ourselves how to do it. It's silly to
ask people to do things we don't know ourselves! TRIZ and the methods activating
thinking can help anyone who has mastered them in his/her work. And I think
there should be a movement to eradicate &quot;the illiteracy in Creativity
Methodologies&quot; for every working person so that he/she can rearrange
his/her work in a more creative way.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">Conclusions:</font></p>
</i></b>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">1. As TRIZ disciples we must enlarge
  TRIZ into non-technological areas and make real attempts on the path toward
  creation of the general theory of creative problem solving like Mr. Altshuller
  wanted us to.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">§ </font><font FACE="Arial">The
        efforts for enlarging TRIZ and teaching enlarged TRIZ for the large
        public should be made on the basis of definite requirements, rules and
        resources to avoid distorting TRIZ philosophy/spirit.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">§ </font><font FACE="Arial">On
        the basis of our own experiences in using TRIZ for solving different
        kinds of problems (not only technological), teaching enlarged TRIZ for
        the large public for more than 20 years and experiences of our former
        learners, we believe that our activities are on the right road to
        implement Mr. Altshuller’s humane ideal.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">§ </font><font FACE="Arial">Teaching
        enlarged TRIZ has the purpose to prepare creativity methodologies users
        on a daily basis. We believe that learners will actually apply
        creativity methodologies in all aspects of their lives only when the
        program can induce inside learners the needed emotions promoting them to
        do that. So our program involves many examples, stories, cases taken
        from different areas of human activity, graphic depictions, cartoons and
        exercises that may inspire such emotions.</font></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">§ </font><font FACE="Arial">In
        spite of the achieved results, there are many points we would like to
        make better, for example, teaching and training works at our Center are
        often overloaded so we lack the time for processing all obtained
        results, doing research and writing new textbooks.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">Visions:</font></p>
</i></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">In the full program of teaching TRIZ there
is one important part: Development of Creative Imagination. Additionally, in
Nine-Systems Thinking Display there are three systems in the future: supersystem,
system and subsystem. According to TRIZ tradition, this paper would be
insufficient if we did not give some thoughts about the future which can be
influenced by TRIZ.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">2. Mankind’s history has shown that
  civilization has been created not because of enhancing (amplifying) human
  psychological and/or physiological abilities. Instead, civilization has been
  created mainly by people working with more and more perfect tools (in the
  largest meaning) which have been built on the basis of discovered objective
  laws and are appropriate for the great masses.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">Among three areas: nature, society and
  thinking which should be understood and transformed by humankind, thinking had
  been receiving the least attention until recently. This imbalance between
  these three areas has served as a deep cause for a great number of tragedies
  at personal, group, even national and global levels.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">In the thinking process for solving
  problems and making decisions, the trial and error method is a natural tool
  which has a great amount of disadvantages. In contrast, TRIZ with its system
  of artificial thinking tools is created on the basis of discovered objective
  laws of systems development. In this relation, the TRIZ approach is
  significantly stronger than an approach based only on human psychology and has
  much larger prospects.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial">Imagine how great humankind’s
  civilization will be when ordinary people work with the perfect tools in
  thinking as they do in the other two areas: nature and society? To realize
  this point, TRIZ needs to be developed towards becoming tools for the great
  masses, not for engineers only.</font></p>

        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Wingdings">§ </font><font FACE="Arial">Human
        life is a succession of problems. Because of many contemporary
        challenges, with time, the amount of problems increases at all
        difficulty levels. To convert the challenges into opportunities,
        everyone should be a good solver in the meaning that he/she is able to
        solve all problems he/she is faced with in a scientific way without
        errors during all of his/her life. In this regard, we believe that
        beside traditional professions which are different for different people
        there is a common profession for all: the profession of solving problems
        and making decisions. In other words, a need for inventing the general
        theory of creative problem solving has emerged.</font></p>

        utmost humanity. Such an education will prepare solvers who can solve
        successfully any problem they encounter in their life and work to
        satisfy their just needs and thus to satisfy social needs of sustainable

  higher schools (of course, with programs corresponding to related learners)
  for some dozen hours each year so the full program is completed when the user
  graduates from university, see Figure 13 and 14. Furthermore, teachers of
  other disciplines need to study TRIZ (or GTCPS) and also to teach their
  disciplines in its light and help their students to themselves discover/invent
  knowledge of these disciplines in a scientific way.</font></p>
