<p align="left">“During WW1, the </i>(Soviet)<i> Navy started using
hydrophones to listen and identify submarine propellers. These hydrophones could
be used only when the ship was stopped or moving very slowly. Otherwise, sounds
generated by water flow at the hydrophone inlet were overwhelming. One engineer
working on improvement knew that hearing of seals was not impaired by their fast
motion. This engineer suggested hydrophone designs whose inlet was shaped as ear
cavity of seal. As a result, the performance improved significantly and
hydrophones could be used when the ship was moving” </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are pleased to announce that the University of Bath has
been successful in acquiring support funding from one of the UK University
research funding bodies to carry out a programme of work to integrate knowledge
from the biological and biomimetic sciences into the TRIZ framework.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The work brings together the Universities combined expertise
in the areas of TRIZ and biomimetics. Indeed, Professor Vincent is one of the
world’s most eminent scholars in the biomimetics arena, initially coining the
term biomimetics, and subsequently producing a stream of papers, articles in the
popular press and television, as well as several monographs on the subject.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme of research will fund three researchers for a
period of three years each.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The work is intended to be complementary to the previous and
current high quality work by other researchers in this field (see for example
References 1, 2), and is expected to be made available to the TRIZ community via
a range of media. Included in these will be regular updates in TRIZ Journal, a
series of papers to be published in academic journals and, ultimately, the
production of a monograph.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyone who has worked in this arena is welcome to contribute
to the programme (if we know of your work, chances are we will have contacted
you already). Our aim is to benefit all TRIZ users by codifying as much of
nature’s good design practice into the TRIZ philosophy. Our efforts will span
the breadth of TRIZ, but will offer specific focus in the following areas:-</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contradictions - What contradictions has nature
  successfully resolved? What Inventive Principles has she used to achieve the
  resolution? Our aim is build on our initial work in this area (3, 4) to
  produce an updated version of the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix - probably with a
  revised list of improving and worsening parameters.</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trends of Evolution - Has nature followed the TRIZ trends?
  Does it know any more that we haven’t uncovered yet? Can we extract knowledge
  from biological evolution to enhance the existing TRIZ technology evolution
  trends</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Knowledge/Effects - classification of knowledge in terms of
  ‘function’ is commonplace in biology. Our intention here is to fit existing
  biological knowledge into the TRIZ functional classification schema, as well
  as expanding this database to include the very large number of biological
  solutions which have not yet been analysed.</li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources - nature is an extremely effective user of
  resources. In terms of achieving the maximum from the minimum resource, we
  have much to learn from nature’s 4 billion years worth of experience. We aim
  to abstract and codify nature’s use of resources into a format accessible to
  problem solvers from all sectors.</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to maximize our effectiveness and allow input access
from the widest possible range of parties working in this field, we have created
a web-site containing means by which everyone can contribute to the research.
This will work on two levels. At the simplest level, we are posting a simple
‘idea’ button for anyone with a desire to direct us towards any ‘good’ nature
solution that they feel should be included (e.g. ‘what about including the
butterfly that is able to change the colour of it’s wings?). At a more
comprehensive level, for the serious worker in the field, we are providing an
input format like that shown in the following figure:</p>

</b></font>
<p align="left"><b>Figure 1: Knowledge Input ProForma</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(All inputs will, of course, be subjected to rigorous
academic scrutiny before being formally accepted into the overall project
knowledge framework in order to ensure a necessary consistency.)</p>

<p>Beneficiaries</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The work is aimed at achieving mutual benefit between TRIZ
users and biologists. As far as the ‘TRIZ community’ is concerned, we hope
everyone will find something useful in what we are doing. In terms of this
month’s special issue on the food industry, we hope there will be specific and
tangible benefits to researchers and workers operating in one of the industries
operating in close proximity with the biological sciences.</p>
