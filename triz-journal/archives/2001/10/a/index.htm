<p>Summary</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This document proposes a strategy to develop systematic
innovation tools for the Food Industry and to promote its active use in the
industrial innovation environment.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The drive for this initiative came from the emerging
systematic innovation tools that originated in TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem
Solving), which have given excellent results in other industrial sectors to
promote trans-sectorial technology transfer, cut down R&amp;D costs and time, and
improve the quality of design solutions. What was in it for the Food Industry?
How could the Food Industry take the best advantage of these new concepts and
working methods?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the financial support of the European Union 5th
Framework Programme, through Accompanying Measure QLAM 2000 - 00093 of key
action 1 (Food, Nutrition &amp; Health, Quality of Life and Management of Living
Resources), a workshop was organised in Cork, Ireland, in November 2000,
bringing together experts on systematic innovation and on food research from
academia, R&amp;D institutes, consultancy companies and the Food Industry. As a
result of this workshop, it was possible to design a strategy and outline a plan
of action to implement it. The dissemination materials of this Accompanying
Measure consist of the Proceedings of the Workshop and this strategy report.</p>
<p>This document was written with food industry researchers/developers and food
scientists in mind, and therefore devotes more attention to the issues that
would be more novel in this environment. It does not discuss problem definition
methods (crucial for consumer-oriented innovation) nor innovation management
techniques in depth - it is assumed that they are known, and excellent material
on these issues, specific of the Food Industry, can be found elsewhere.</p>
<p>This report initially discusses the fundamental aspects of systematic
innovation seen from a problem solving perspective. This leads to the
understanding of how the development of technical intelligence systems to manage
scientific/technological knowledge finds an excellent starting point in TRIZ and
emerging spin-off tools.</p>
<p>A brief analysis of the development needs of both scientific research and
industrial innovation suffices to visualise the importance of effective tools
and of their efficient use in food industry innovation. </p>
<p>The type of initiatives needed to move forward are then outlined and an
action plan to materialise them is proposed. It becomes evident that a concerted
effort of an international network involving industry, trainers and R&amp;D
performers needs to be set up to achieve the strategic objectives to be pursued.</p>
<p>It is expected that this report could constitute a vehicle to harness
expressions of interest from interested parties on the activities proposed for
this network, and contacts are most welcome.</p>

<p>1. Background and rationale</p>
</b></u><font size="2">
<i>
<p>Why is a research strategy needed to promote systematic innovation in the
Food Industry? </p>
</i>
<p>Strategic research is performed by a critical mass of researchers that target
an ambitious goal that can only be reached with a comprehensive approach
involving a well defined series of specific initiatives. To perceive the need
for such an action, we must first clarify the basic issues:</p>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li>What is systematic innovation?</li>
  <li>Does the Food Industry need its concepts and tools?</li>
  <li>If so, how can they be deployed?</li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be a need for strategic research if the answer to
this last question identifies requirements for systems, concepts or tools that
are not yet developed, or that still require adaptation to the specific needs of
the Food Industry, and these can only be met by a concerted effort. Henceforth,
the definition of a research strategy should be straightforward, by addressing
the actions that are needed to fulfill these requirements.</p>
<font size="2">
</font><b>
<p>1.1. What is systematic innovation?</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this report we will consider systematic innovation as the
application of tools and working methods that enable a systematic and objective
approach to the specification and resolution of design problems in product and
process development.</p>
<font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This view of systematic innovation involves various concepts
and methods with different origin, that can be integrated for a comprehensive
and effective management of creativity and innovation in industrial R&amp;D. Problem
definition tools, such as QFD (Quality Function Deployment) and focus groups,
idea generation techniques, such as brainstorming and lateral thinking, and
others, are increasingly used by the Food Industry, and we could take them as a
starting point. However, problem solving, and particularly the use of
scientific/technological principles outside the specific areas of food science &amp;
technology, are lacking expertise of similar calibre in our industrial sector.
At present, solving design problems is mostly left to the individual expertise
of developers, the ability to find outside information, or laboratory/pilot
experimentation. This report is therefore particularly concerned with this
dimension: how do we solve design problems? </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A very promising concept has been proposed and tested in
other industrial sectors, known as TRIZ. We will start by looking at this theory
and build the systematic innovation concepts from there.</p>
<b>
<p>1.1.1. A brief history of TRIZ</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ was developed by Genrich Altschuller, a Russian
physicist and naval officer. The 1940’s find him beginning his career at the
patent office of the Russian Navy. Trying to feed his inquisitive mind in a
place where there was not much happening, Altschuller looked around at all that
wealth of information, of innovative ideas to solve thousands of problems, and
set himself a task: to find out how people solve problems. Would each patent be
the result of a genial individual and unrepeatable discovery? Was there a
general philosophy or scientific method underlying inventivity? Is invention an
art, or is it a science with its own underlying principles being applied over
and over again?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Answer this question yourself. Is inventivity an art, which
requires a natural, born, artist (the “inventor”), or is it a science, that can
be learnt by decoding its basic principles? Do you have to be born an inventor,
or can you learn to be one?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patents were very good “raw materials” for this task, because
they were written in such a neat way: what is the problem? why are there no
successful (or satisfactory) solutions? why is this new solution suitable (or
better than others)? how does it work? Altschuller processed patent after patent
to systematise all this information and found that:</p>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">patterns of technological evolution were repeated
  across industries and sciences. The type of problems that were solved in each
  given sector followed a similar pattern over time, which indicated that the
  evolution of scientific and technical knowledge trailed a similar path of
  development regardless of the specific area in question.</p>
  </li>
  <font size="2">
  </font>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">solutions to problems could be described as the
  application of a limited number of general principles to specific situations.
  Once you raised yourself above the detailed specificity of a problem and
  expressed it in general terms, you started to see that solutions to problems
  were repeated across industries and sectors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">many problems basically involve a contradiction
  between conflicting factors (for instance, something needs to be bigger to be
  more productive but smaller to be cheaper; something needs to be heavier to
  include more functionality but lighter to be more efficient, etc.).
  Conventional solutions were compromises between the conflicting factors: a
  true innovation resulted from solving the conflict completely, and this was
  done by applying an appropriate scientific effect that allowed us to get rid
  of the conflict. Innovations usually resulted from applying an effect that had
  proven its success in other fields of science/technology time and time again.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What do you think of these conclusions? Do you think that you
can solve problems using the same scientific effects that others used in very
different industrial processes? Or does it look to you that each area of science
and technology has a totally different environment to any other, and knowledge
is sector-specific?</p>
<font size="2">
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Altschuller initially proposed 40 inventive principles.
According to him, hundreds of thousands of patents that addressed engineering
design problems could be summarised in the application of one (or more) of 40
basic effects. He went further than this, and proposed a contradiction matrix,
listing 39 factors that could be in conflict (for instance, weight of moving
object, weight of stationary object, power, ease of operation, etc.). In this
matrix, you can find for each intersection of two factors which general
principles out of the 40 can be used to solve this conflict. Do you have a
problem between, say, the length of a moving object and the duration of the
action? Does the object need to be short for some reason, but that causes the
duration of the action to be insufficient? Look at the contradiction matrix and
you find that problems of this nature have been inventively solved by applying
principle number 19, which is: “Periodic Action”. This may mean something like:
a) instead of continuous action, use periodic or pulsating actions; b) if an
action is periodic, change the periodic magnitude or frequency; c) use pauses
between impulses to perform a different action.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key to combining thousands of patents in such a concise
way was the ability to interpret the problem in the “general terms” which give
us access to the underlying scientific principles / effects, and then the
ability to translate the solution back to the specific level of our problem.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Altschuller realised that he had found something that could
have enormous impact on technological development, and not only on problem
solving. As patterns of technological evolution repeat, you can foresee the
direction of evolution of technologies by visualising where you are in this
pattern. Foresight becomes less speculative and more solidly based on reality.
As patterns of solutions repeat across industries and sectors, you can, and
indeed you should, benefit from solutions developed in other sectors of science
and industry, and here was the tool</p>
<font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">that allowed you to do this so effectively. After all,
finding an innovative solution could be done by applying systematically a path
of problem solving that led you towards a revolutionary result by moving up,
then moving down, in the level of knowledge specificity that you work with. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Altschuller called it the Theory of Inventive Problem
Solving, which gives the acronym TRIZ in Russian. Forget about compromises,
solve problems innovatively - you will be surprised how often an innovative
solution can be found by deploying solutions that are already there - you just
have to move up, then down, to find them. Anyone can be an inventor and a
revolutionary innovator, you just need to master this process.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rest of the story might have been different if
Altschuller had been working elsewhere in space and time. In his context,
Stalin’s Russia, his ideas on TRIZ actually led him to a Gulag. On returning to
normal life after Stalin’s demise, Altschuller started teaching his method to
fellow engineers and scientists, and the TRIZ school commenced. For decades, it
was restricted to a discrete group of Russian engineers. They kept working on
the concept, and more “inventive principles” were proposed for other areas of
knowledge, such as geometry, chemistry, etc. TRIZ generated a set of tools, and
not only problem-solving ones. After “glasnost” in the 80’s, TRIZ-trained
Russian engineers found opportunities outside Russia to deploy their techniques
in multinational companies and western society discovered TRIZ. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This “discovery” came at a particularly appropriate time,
when management gurus were talking about knowledge management, the knowledge
centred-economy, the importance of multidisciplinarity, of “learning with/from
others”, and the value of know-how. Suddenly, TRIZ could become quite
fashionable.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the method was not very easy or straightforward to
grasp, and was not geared towards the way of thinking of western problem-solvers
- it was fine for Russian engineers with abstract mathematical minds, but proved
difficult to industry-minded people with little time to spare. Russian experts
were claiming that you needed decades to become an efficient TRIZ user.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fast and user-friendly solutions are key to success. It was a
matter of time before experts moved ahead by applying knowledge processing
systems and information technologies to produce tools that facilitate not only
learning TRIZ, but also using it. With time, evolution took the original concept
beyond TRIZ. Visiting the websites of the Invention Machine Corp. (www.cobrain.com)
or Ideation International (www.ideation.com) is mandatory to see how far modern
systems have evolved. Over 3.8 million patents have now been processed by
semantic processing technologies.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The original concept has fruitified in many directions, as it
evolved in a competitive industrial environment. TRIZ is particularly good as a
problem-solving tool, but problem definition techniques are just as, if not
more, important for the Food Industry. The crucial market success factors are
the product targets (is this the right product for the market segment that we
wish to reach?), and TRIZ is not so helpful to establish them, it is more suited
to assist us in finding a way to solve the design problems of the product or
process, once we have defined what we want to achieve. We might talk about
“systematic innovation” in general, encompassing not only problem solving tools
but also problem-definition ones, some emerging from TRIZ and its spin-offs,
others drawn from elsewhere. There are applications of these concepts in a wide
variety of situations: engineering problems, business problems, even developing
university curricula. The TRIZ Journal at www.triz-journal.com can be consulted
for scientific articles on a variety of applications of systematic innovation in
general, again not restricted to TRIZ tools.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This text explored in particular the problem-solving ability
of TRIZ. For more details, the Proceedings of the workshop associated to this
Accompanying Measure can be consulted, with cross-referencing to the most
fundamental TRIZ texts. The online TRIZ Journal is also a good starting source
to find more information (at www.triz-journal.com).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>1.1.2. A conceptual framework</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A personal perspective may help to visualise a wider context
than simple problem-solving novelties.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not see TRIZ as just a tool, albeit an effective one,
crucial for the overall systematic innovation concept. The reason why it is so
appealing to me is more fundamental. I propose that we take a TRIZ-type look at
evolution, move a little bit away from our specific concerns regarding Research
&amp; Development, and hover above to get a bird’s eye picture of where we came
from, where we are, and where we think we should be going from here.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest that we really start in the beginning. Let us take
Ancient Egypt. This was an integrated culture: everything was tied up to
everything else. Astronomy, politics, religion, agriculture, wealth, health,
architecture, everything had to do with everything else. The first great
architect (Imhotep, ca. 2600 B.C.), who is accredited with giant leaps in
pyramid building technology, was the great vizir of King Djoser of the 3rd
dynasty, high priest of Amon, and founder of Egyptian medicine - that’s like
being architect, prime-minister, Pope, astronomer, mathematician, and still find
time for a Nobel prize of medicine. This does not mean that he had an expertise
is several, independent, areas of knowledge: he used everything together (e.g.
use mathematics to apply astronomy in architecture and get a religious result).
You cannot understand Egyptian religion without astronomy, nor politics without
religion, nor agriculture without astronomy (how else could you predict the
floods of the Nile?). And incidentally, if you believe that it was easier then
because there was less knowledge to grasp, you try and come up with a suitable
process to build a 138 m high pyramid composed of 2.5 million blocks weighing 2
- 70 tons each (that’s over 90 million ft3 of stone masonry, more than all
cathedrals and churches of England put together, and enough to build 30 Empire
State buildings), and do it in less than 30 years - this is Khufu’s feat, with
the Great Pyramid of Giza (4th dynasty, ca. 2500 BC). If Imhotep or Khufu had
written a “Handbook of logistics” I guess we would still be using it in
University. Or perhaps not, because we might think that the book had too much
astronomy and religion in it, and not enough logistics, as we would not
understand how things that to us are so different could be understood jointly.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This embracive approach passed to our civilisation after
filtering and enhancing by the inquisitive Ancient Greeks. This was a time when
everything was still tied up to everything else. However, when we now look back,
we tend to see different Greek scientists as initiators of different individual
disciplines, as if dispersion came then, because we apply our modern way of
thinking to interpret history.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the industrial revolution, specialisation was really
necessary to advance knowledge. It was no longer feasible for one single
individual to grasp everything that was needed in all areas of knowledge. As we
moved ahead, breakthroughs implied a high degree of specialisation.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now live in a highly analytical era, where knowledge is
composed by a very large variety of individual disciplines that have been
developing largely without communicating too much between them. We think this is
right, because this is how progress has largely been made: someone who knows a
lot about computing makes a better computer. When faced with a problem, we
analyse it to death, and that is how we get rid of it. If we solve a problem by
avoiding it, we risk being labelled “cheaters” because we did not use an
accepted scientific method to tackle it. When we need an integrated result, we
assemble a multidisciplinary team - we have the expert geologist, the expert
electrical engineer, the expert marketeer, etc. Sometimes, we need to smoothen
the interfaces, because the level of specialisation increased so much that
different experts started thinking and working in different ways, and it may be
difficult to match expectations with deliveries in a multidisciplinary team
(just think of all the anecdotes between engineers and marketeers).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us now assume for a moment that this is the right way to
keep going. Experts know more and more about less and less, to increase
specialisation so that breakthroughs can keep being made. Some time ago we just
had biologists. Since Pasteur, we have biologists and microbiologists. What
about now? biologists, microbiologists, physiologists, molecular biologists,
geneticists, ...? </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Think of an example. Did it ever happen to you something like
talking to a microbiologist about what you think is a microbiology problem and
he tells you - “sorry, but that’s a molecular biology problem and I’m a
physiologist, I don’t have a clue”?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about the future? Will we have an expert for genetic
engineering of type A, another for genetic engineering of type B, etc.? Will
everyone have to be working that way, scientific research as well as industrial
R&amp;D? And then when we need to assemble a team to come up with an innovative
product/process, we have to bring together 137 different individuals? Where will
it stop?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest that just like sometime in the past we came to the
conclusion that we could not keep being all-encompassing integrated thinkers and
required analytical thinking and specialisation, we see ourselves going way over
the other extreme now. We desperately require integrating skills, the ability to
pull together different areas of knowledge and get a result, without necessarily
being ourselves experts (perhaps we could say “over-experts”) of each and every
issue involved.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this context, TRIZ seems to be an interesting starting
point. It is at least a tool that is pointing in the right direction at this
moment of evolution of science. When we move from our specific problem to the
“general level” of TRIZ, where we identify the contradictions, principles and
effects, we are moving to a different level of knowledge, where perspectives are
more integrated. By using TRIZ, we get the type of perspective that Imhotep or
Aristotle used to have. We should seriously think about improving our capacity
to integrate knowledge in order to design new products, new processes, and new
solutions. However, we cannot do it any more without proper tools, because we
cannot possible store all relevant pieces of information in the mind of one
single individual, perhaps not even in those of a team of manageable size. I do
not expect TRIZ to be THE solution for this, but I know of no other place where
we might start that seems more appropriate. And now that we have so many
efficient information systems around, what else do we need?</p>

<u><b>
<p>1.2. Does the Food Industry need the concepts and tools of systematic
innovation?</p>
</b></u><b>
<p>1.2.1. Systematic innovation and food research</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do we know enough about food products and manufacturing
processes, or do we need to keep investing in experimental research to find out
more? If we know enough, than we should be able to do anything; if there is
something that we cannot do, than we need to perform experimental research.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you agreed with the last sentence entirely, you may be
thinking in terms of a linear relationship between finding something through
experimental research and being able to solve a problem - if there is something
you cannot do, you need to perform research to find a solution. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What do you think? What expectations do you have concerning
research? If we spend twice as much in finding new knowledge, will we get twice
the results? And if not, why not?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One only finds a solution for an important problem when one
searches for it, and one can often find valuable scientific information which
does not solve any pressing problem. Research funding agencies have been trying
to improve the linearity between research output and solutions by forcing
research to be targeted at solutions - we call this a problem-oriented approach.
It is valid for applied research only, of course, but food research largely gets
that label these days. This might seem a positive step for the tax payer, who
has been supporting public-funded scientific </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">research, while it makes public and private (company)
research funding more difficult to differentiate. It also means that food
researchers no longer look for funds with their research areas, now they use a
portfolio of problems to solve instead. Exception is made, or course, to
fundamental scientific work involving biotechnology and genetics, and
public-good related research (e.g. food safety, food and health, allergenicity).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as knowledge grows exponentially, we should start
finding solutions without requiring any experimental research. Should there not
be a time when we can produce solutions at a faster rate than research outputs,
because we can use already existing information to come up with results and
ideas? </p>

<p align="left"><img SRC="Image121.gif" width="566" height="371"></p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The figure above sketches this concept. It is inevitable that
sooner or later knowledge will increase to such an extent that we move from the
convex to the concave shape. If you believe that in terms of food products we
have not arrived there yet, systematic innovation is not yet crucial to you: one
problem = one research project; if you think that such a time has passed, than
you might need to start deploying systematic innovation tools to facilitate your
work.</p>
<font size="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p>1.2.2. Issues for academia</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While generating new knowledge is as important as ever, being
able to find and apply existing knowledge is increasingly becoming the most
crucial hurdle in industry-oriented problems. The development of the knowledge
economy sounds great for universities and researchers - we have the raw
materials, so the future should be bright for us. However, the fact that
everybody has to eat does not mean that farmers are very wealthy. Having raw
materials does not imply profits - it does not even imply being able to sell.
Academics and researchers have been very competent at generating new knowledge,
but need to improve substantially the capacity to manage it and to work with
existing knowledge across areas of science and technology in order to keep being
competitive partners of industrial development. We should be moving from a
knowledge-generating perspective to a knowledge-management perspective.
Management includes raw materials, and they are a crucial part, but are not the
full equation.</p>
<b>
<p>1.2.3. Issues for industry</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the average life cycle of a food product shrinking
drastically, requiring an ever growing capacity to renew product portfolios, the
interest of enabling tools that can facilitate product and process development,
cut down development time, decrease R&amp;D costs and improve the quality of the
final result, needs no defence. Food companies do not look at R&amp;D as an end in
itself, but as a means to achieve an end, which is to innovate products and
processes and to solve problems. Laboratory research in some core areas
underpinning food products and food constituents has spiralling costs. However,
the role of industry is not to generate research output, but to exploit it for
commercial value. Exponentially increasing experimental research costs do not
necessarily imply exponentially increasing industrial R&amp;D costs. Furthermore,
according to the Commission Innovation Survey of 1998, only about 50% of
industrial innovation costs in European companies are R&amp;D. If we manage
knowledge better, we can be a lot more efficient in the innovation costs
department, and really do more for less.</p>
<font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Food Industry could benefit more from the knowledge
accumulated by worldwide research across areas of science and technology if it
would come in a usable form. The Design News Reader Survey of 1999 (KM World
Report) reported that R&amp;D professionals spend only 43% of their time actually
developing solutions: a similar amount is spent just searching for information
(10%) and reading it (33%). As information sources grow, finding crucial
information becomes an unmanageable task for ordinary search methods. However,
an effective interface between knowledge processed and managed in a directly
usable form and the development tasks of industry requires not only an upstream
connection, but also an appropriate downstream one. Does systematic innovation
imply changes in the R&amp;D working methodologies and the associated thought
processes at the company level itself? Should scientific knowledge management
dovetail with creativity management and company culture? If so, it is not
possible to envisage the upstream development of scientific/technical knowledge
management systems for problem-solving by researchers, that are then fed to
companies: an active role is required for industry.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have described systematic innovation starting from a novel
problem-solving perspective and visualised this concept as a strategic approach
to promote knowledge and technology transfer across areas of science and
technology, and efficient retrieval and use of scientific information. We have
described what we could call “technology intelligence systems” as not only a
tool, but a whole different mental model at the base of industrial innovation.
We concluded that this would allow us to cut down research costs, speed
solutions and improve their quality, and if we combine this with appropriate
problem-definition tools for consumer-oriented innovation, we will be able to
deploy very effective working methods that give us more for less. We then
established that this vision of systematic innovation is of crucial strategic
importance not only to industry, but to academic and scientific research as
well. We are convinced that we want to see this happening throughout the food
industry and must now discuss how to materialise our vision.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.3. How can we deploy systematic innovation tools in the Food Industry?</p>
</b><i>
<p>We must address a series of issues to answer this question properly:</p>
</i></font>
</p><ul>
  <li>Can the problem solving tools (e.g. TRIZ, semantic knowledge
    processing) that have been developed and applied largely in other industrial
    sectors be deployed in the Food Industry immediately, without any particular

  <li>Do we need new tools, specific for biologically-based problems,
    which do not exist yet?</li>

    this?</li>

    tools?</li>
  <li>Can we develop novel problem-solving tools/methods independently
    of problem-definition ones? if we need to develop them jointly, what is the
    best way to do it?</li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we answer these questions, we will start to visualise the
type of initiatives that we must organise to achieve our objective. How did we
go about answering them?</p>
<font size="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><u><b>
<p>2. Methodology</p>
</b></u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Accompanying Measure brought together over 50 systematic
innovation experts and academic &amp; industrial researchers to address these issues
in a workshop (the Proceedings can be consulted in another document).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The underlying concepts were first presented and explored
with a set of keynote lectures in the specific context of the Food Industry.
Experts in systematic innovation clarified the issues to alert food researchers
and industrialists to the potential of this methodology, and food-related case
studies were reviewed.</p>
<font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The audience was then divided for group work sessions. Five
groups were organised in the first session, dividing the audience evenly, so
that each group had a mix of the different backgrounds present at the workshop.
Each group analysed independently possible answers to 2 questions: (i) What are
the fundamental problems where a TRIZ-type approach could significantly improve
current status? (e.g. food product development, inc. customer-oriented problem
definition; food science knowledge processing; technology forecasting); (ii)
What initiatives are needed to address these problems? (in research; deployment;
training).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The workshop committee analysed the results of the various
groups, and six areas of interest for developing future initiatives emerged:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(i). Case study on application of TRIZ in the catering versus
home quality contradiction; </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(ii). Development of TRIZ training programmes at
Universities; </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iii). Development of a standardised method of analysing the
impact of TRIZ in case studies; </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(iv). Application of TRIZ methods in technology forecasting;
</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(v). Development of a series of case studies that involve the
application of systematic innovation to food industry problems; </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(vi). Translation of the TRIZ inventive principles to a food
industry perspective (the “food inventive principles”).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The audience reassembled to discuss the findings and select
the three most promising areas (iv, v and vi above). It then divided in three
groups, according to the interests of each participant. Each group discussed
follow-up work.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of these discussions, the project co-ordinator
answered the questions indicated in section 1.3, placed the suggestions in
perspective to define a comprehensive view of the way forward in line with
strategic objectives, analysed opportunities for networking and funding, and
proposes a series of initiatives in this document. It is intended to disseminate
the findings, harness the support and commitment of academic and industrial
researchers/developers, establish a network, and develop the initiatives as
opportunities materialise.</p>
<b><u>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Proposed strategy</p>
</u>
<p>3.1. Needs</p>
</b>
<p>Let us address the needs by answering the questions of section 1.3.</p>
</font>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <font FACE="Symbol">
    <p>· </font><i>Can the problem solving tools (e.g. TRIZ, semantic knowledge
    processing) that have been developed and applied largely in other industrial
    sectors be deployed in the Food Industry immediately, without any particular
    adaptation?</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</i><b>
<p>Yes.</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ can be used to solve equipment design problems in the
food industry, as some examples given at the Workshop show. When the process
design issue can be solved by the general engineering principles, it does not
really matter whether the product is a food or something else. Handling the
physical dimension of product attributes is also possible (see the Workshop
Proceedings for examples). However, it must be noted that food processing
sometimes involves contradictory results between processing targets and safety
targets - improving processability cannot jeopardise safety margins.
Applications are not necessarily straightforward: the biological dimension must
be part of a systematic innovation system even if the problem and/or solution
are not biological in themselves.</p>
<font size="2">
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the general principles can be interpreted in
biological terms. Just as TRIZ principles have found applications in business
problems (see the Workshop Proceedings and Mann, D. &amp; Domb, E., TRIZ Journal,
September 1999) or social problems (see Terninko, J., TRIZ Journal June 2001),
they can equally be applied to food problems. Some examples of “food”
interpretations of inventive principles can be found in Winkless and Mann, TRIZ
Journal May 2001.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is therefore possible, and highly desirable, to train food
product and process developers in the use of systematic innovation techniques
and tools and deploy them in food product/process development.</p>
<font size="2">
</font>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <font FACE="Symbol">
    <p>· </font><i>· Do we need new tools, specific for biologically-based
    problems, which do not exist yet?</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</i><b>
<p>Yes as well</b>!</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Albeit the positive note given in the previous answer, the
fact is that the ability of TRIZ to impact the food industry in the same way as
other industries is far more limited by the lack of systematic information on
biochemical and biological aspects. Seeing how neatly the existing inventive
principles can be used in engineering design, one cannot fail to desire such a
fine system to help us with biological problems. The semantic knowledge
processing system of the Invention Machine Corp. does allow the possibility to
find relevant patents concerning enzyme technology and biotechnology, which is
helpful, but still falls short of what we might need.</p>
<font size="2">
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Visualising the ideal scenario is not difficult: we would
like to be able to solve problems with food products that involve
multidimensional factors such as texture, flavour, shelf-life, enzymic activity,
microbial activity, consumer attitudes, etc. just like we can do with current
TRIZ tools in industries like car manufacturing or aeronautics. For the physical
dimensions of the problem we are well served by TRIZ, but we cannot do the same
with the biological dimensions. Instead of working from TRIZ to foods and
translate the 40 inventive principles to illustrate them in food situations,
could we work from the food patents and build “food inventive principles”? There
are thousands of patents concerning food products - if they could be
systematised, resulting in simple and effective </p>
<font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">tools like the existing TRIZ principles of geometry,
chemistry, etc., they would be of immense value to food product and process
development. Or is it better to work with existing tools, adapt and develop
complementing ones, as needed?</p>
<i>
<dir>
  <dir>
    </i></font><font FACE="Symbol">
    <p>· </font><i>How can we develop new tools?</p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ was originally developed by looking into thousands of
patents, and so we could envisage going through every food-related patent one by
one, with a food scientist eye. This is a difficult job to perform, that would
take many years and for which it would be probably difficult to find funding.
Academic researchers might not be very interested either, as the
effort-publication ratio is not attractive.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also an obvious complexity in the system-specific
nature of many effects (the same factor may cause different effects in different
matrices depending on their characteristics). It would be logical to think that
the food inventive principles that we are missing would largely have to be
described at molecular level, not at the macro-level of whole food products.
Food and nutrition research is moving in that direction, very much as would be
predicted by the general laws of evolution of TRIZ (“move into micro-level”).
This will help to visualise “food problems” at a level that would allow for a
more effective systematisation.</p>
<font size="2">
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The work involved would require an initial TRIZ training, to
strengthen the capabilities of analysing functions of a system at a general
level, which is the core of TRIZ. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could envisage a systematic work of processing food
patents one by one, analysing the functions of the systems involved, the
contradictions and the factor-effect relations at the heart of each solution.
This would lead to a systematisation of food patents in a series of inventive
principles. Such work is very time consuming and of uncertain outcome.</p>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <font FACE="Symbol">
    <p>· </font><i>How are we going to adapt existing tools?</p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Adapting existing tools for “food” use would be faster and
perhaps more efficient than working from scratch, albeit not so comprehensive.
Using existing tools will inevitably lead to an increasing adaptation to the
needs of food design problems. This will likely come more from the working
methods than from the tools themselves. Therefore, instead of considering “what
else do we need” in abstract, it seems more appropriate to use existing tools to
solve real problems in industrial design, and extract from here needs for
adaptations and complementation.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Promoting the use of TRIZ tools in food product and process
design will lead to adaptations and identify complementary tools that might be
needed to deal with the biological nature of foods.</p>
<font size="2">
</font>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <font FACE="Symbol">
    <p>· </font><i>What are the training needs for deploying systematic
    innovation tools?</p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether we would be considering some new developments in
TRIZ-type tools or limit ourselves to existing ones, training in basic TRIZ is
essential. First and foremost, TRIZ is a new thinking model and grasping its
concepts will assist developers to think more systematically, orienting towards
functional analysis. At the workshop, experts in TRIZ have reported that
developers generally find it difficult to learn and incorporate TRIZ tools into
their working life when starting from software. The conceptual (theoretical)
aspects are very important to ensure an effective uptake of TRIZ tools. The
first training need is the concept, the thinking model, the way of working.
Tools should come next.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The type of training courses run by TRIZ consultants seem a
very appropriate starting point. The concepts are presented alongside practical
sessions where the participants work out examples of their own choice.
Organising this type of courses for food companies on a large scale throughout
Europe would therefore be very beneficial.</p>
<font size="2">
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, it is also fundamental to consider the needs for
systematic innovation from the point of view of the product design, particularly
translating consumer needs and wants into quantifiable product targets. There
are similar training programmes available for QFD, but this does not cover all
the needs.</p>
<font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A comprehensive plan for hands-on training on systematic
innovation tools in general may be needed to really make an impact in the
European Food Industry.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Universities could have a major role in a medium term, if
they would incorporate teaching of these subjects in their educational
programmes. It would be far more effective in the long run if the skills
required for problem definition and problem solving were already discussed and
tested during undergraduate training. Education in industry-oriented areas such
as food science and technology should devote particular attention to help
graduates see themselves as problem-solvers, not just a repository of scientific
knowledge. This could tie up very well with final year projects, design projects
and new product development projects that some courses have in their curricula.
Industry would welcome graduates already oriented towards problem solving
approaches.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We envisage the need to promote systematic innovation
training programmes to food developers working in industry, and to incorporate
these issues in university undergraduate programmes. </p>
</font>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <font FACE="Symbol">
    <p>· </font><i>Can we develop novel problem-solving tools/methods
    independently of problem-definition ones?</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</i><b>
<p>No.</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ultimately, the success of innovation is the market success,
and this does not depend on how effective or elegant the process design
solutions are, except insofar as cost competitiveness is crucial and was
improved. Once systematic thinking stirs creative and innovative thinking in
process design problems, we wish to have an equally good systematic capacity to
use consumer data to design products (manage consumers knowledge). The two
dimensions, product design and process design, relate to problem-definition and
problem-solving tools. We must develop the two interactively, it is senseless to
focus on one side with the other being dealt with trivially. In knowledge
management, this approach is called “concurrent product and process
development”. Industry is already moving in product design tools, such as QFD
(see Costa, Dekker and Jongen, Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology, 2001, pp.
306-314). This could be put in perspective as part of a comprehensive systematic
innovation approach. </p>
<font size="2">
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once we interiorise TRIZ concepts and excel at analysing the
functionality of systems, we must expand our working abilities to integrate
problem definition as well as problem solving, and develop our capabilities for
product and process design concurrently. </p>

    <p>· </font><i>What is the best way to develop problem definition and
    problem solving tools and methods concurrently?</p>
    </i>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although it can be argued that existing tools are not
perfected for use in food innovation, they really are more than enough to
incorporate these methods and concepts straight away. Needs for adaptation and
complementarity will be better identified from experience in working with the
existing systems, and the eventual success of this type of approach will then
make it easier to find support to embark on more comprehensive work. Also, the
specific needs will be better understood and such work could be much more
focused and targeted.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same is true about the methodology for working the whole
aspects of process and product design jointly, interfacing problem definition
and problem solving. The WOIS technique promoted </p>
<font size="2">
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">by the WOIS Institute, Germany, is an example of integration
of various of these tools for technology foresight (see the Workshop
Proceedings). Other strategies have been suggested: e.g. AFTER (see Kowalik, J.,
TRIZ Journal, January 1997), Collaborative Innovation (see Zeidner &amp; Wood, TRIZ
Journal, May 2000). We must start to put these concepts and tools to work for
food industry problems.</p>
<font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The best way to develop systematic innovation tools
concurrently is to start by using those that exist to solve real problems, learn
from experience, and build from there. </p>
<b>
<p>· Conclusion of the needs analysis</p>
</b><i>
<p>From these answers, and taking the suggestions collected at the workshop, we
obtain the following picture for our needs list:</p>
</i>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should put systematic innovation tools to
    work in food process and product design straight away.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This will give us experience on how to interface
    these tools effectively, an answer that will likely depend on the nature of
    business and corporate culture of specific companies.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will certainly feel specific needs for
    adaptation and complementarity to deal with biological dimensions of food
    matrices. We will then have a more focused perception of how to achieve
    this, which may avoid the need to work from scratch with food patents.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should develop an objective way to assess the
    impact of this methodology in the examples used on food innovation to
    quantify and qualify benefits more clearly and incentive its uptake at a
    larger scale.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The starting point should be good TRIZ training
    with hands-on approach to master the most relevant concepts of the new
    thinking model. This must be part of a comprehensive training plan on
    systematic innovation tools, to further incorporate product design
    capabilities for consumer-oriented innovation. Our research strategy starts
    with training, which actually incorporates the initial work with case
    studies already, and is not separated from researching our needs for further
    developments.</p>
    </li>
  <li>There are two environments for such training:</li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-First and foremost, industrial companies: train the process
and product developers while helping them to use these tools in their problems
for the first time, as part of the training.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-For a wide longer term benefit, University programmes,
preferably linked to product and/or process development projects for final year
or postgraduate students: strengthen the capacity of Universities to deliver
problem-solvers to the industry. It would be highly beneficial if such student
projects would be developed in co-operation with industrial companies to provide
a strong real-life orientation.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<font size="2">
</font><u><b>
<p>3.2. Initiatives to meet the needs</p>
</b></u>
<p>From the needs analysis and the discussions at the workshop, the following
strategic initiatives can be outlined:</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.2.1. Design and delivery of a comprehensive training
programme on systematic innovation tools for industry developers </p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most common type of training model for QFD and TRIZ seems
excellent: circa 3 days workshops where the concepts are presented in lecture
sessions, worked out in examples </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">selected by the trainees, divided in working groups, in
practical sessions, and then the experience is reviewed in wrap-up sessions. The
training therefore combines learning with actual R&amp;D consultancy coaching for
deploying the concepts to solve problems of interest to each trainee’s company.
There are consultancy companies in Europe, US and Japan that already offer a
comprehensive range of courses that would allow industrial companies to select a
number of different topics, according to their needs: TRIZ, QFD, Taguchi, etc.
Therefore, the only thing that seems necessary at first is to incentive
companies to hire trainers and move forward individually.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, tailor-made training programmes are an option only
to companies of sufficient </p>
<font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">dimension to justify the costs. As training includes a
practical, consultancy coaching, dimension, they are not expected to come cheap
- a group of less than 15 people would have too high unit costs. Furthermore,
training courses are only a starting point - developers must continue to work
with the newly acquired tools to develop proficient skills, and there is a
danger of losing momentum without a continuing interaction. Networking is
important to maximise the benefits of systematic innovation training. The
collaborative training model presented by Kalevi Rantanen at the workshop is a
good one; networking can be virtual.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is some merit therefore in trying to develop a
standardised approach with an extended network, considering a series of
workshops - perhaps 3 to 5, that would unfold over a period of 1 - 2 years to
develop the various working methods, starting with TRIZ and ending with
concurrent product and process design skills. These programmes would be
organised geographically, drawing participants from various companies, thereby
opening the access of SME’s to this type of training on a par with others. There
would be a network including a pool of trainers in various regions, and a common
programme that would be multiplied across Europe. A network of alumni would
emerge, to provide continuing exchange and support beyond the workshops.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another advantage of a comprehensive programme promoted by a
network for the specific benefit of the Food Industry is that trainers will
eventually develop a good set of case studies and adjust their training to the
needs and requirements of this industry. As things are at the moment, the Food
Industry is not a major target for systematic innovation trainers. There are
many aspects of food products that can be easily overlooked or simplified by
existing training materials, mostly because of the biological dimensions (safety
and shelf life).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We therefore envisage the design of a training programme
consisting of a number of workshops on complementing topics of systematic
innovation that results from pooling together existing modular courses, perhaps
adding one or two new modules if needed. This design should be made by a working
group including industrialists and systematic innovation trainers, that would
focus on the needs of the industry and the delivery capacity of the trainers.
Running at least one pilot set will be needed to validate the programme -
requirements for adaptation are likely to emerge (specially in terms of case
studies and tools for working with consumer data). Then, it is just a question
of delivering the courses around Europe, continuously monitoring and updating
the contents and approaches as a result of the experience accumulated. </p>
<p>As this type of initiatives will certainly be more expensive than plain
training, due to the practical, consultancy, dimension, the impact of pilot runs
of the programme is very important for companies to decide on the value for
money. There is no better selling argument that the impact factors of what we
wish to sell. If we can bring down the costs of the pilot runs, this would be
very important to be able to organise them. However, without additional funding
from public agencies, the pilot runs would actually be more expensive, because
of the course development costs, which is exactly the opposite of what we want
for moving fast. Targeting this type of funding whether at national or EU level
requires a strong and credible network and again we conclude that networking is
crucial for success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.2.2. Development of case studies on the use of systematic
innovation tools in the Food Industry for concurrent product and process
development</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ultimately, this is the core activity that we would like to
see multiplied throughout Europe: an expanding number of product and process
development projects performed with ever-increasing efficiency using
continuously improving systematic innovation tools and working methods.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pilot case studies will be very important to commence, they
are the seeds. They will provide objective impact assessment of the benefits,
generate experience on best practices of using and combining various tools, and
clearly identify additional needs for tools/adaptations. They will also be most
useful for the systematic innovation trainers to improve the relevance of their
training programmes to “food clients”.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem with developing cases studies for general use was
immediately picked up at the Workshop: by its very nature the results are likely
to be very sensitive concerning intellectual property value. If a given
industrial company develops a very good example for one of their new products
that they hope to be a success and give them a good competitive advantage, would
they be willing to immediately show to others how they did it and what exact
results they got? Even the formulation of conventional products that are on the
market for decades is sensitive information. If the case study is a real problem
with a very good result, we do not want to tell others about it; if we do not
mind telling others about it, maybe the problem is not so relevant or the
solution not that good, and so the case study is not very effective.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We might apply one of the TRIZ inventive principles to solve
this conundrum: principle 1 - segmentation (A: divide an object into independent
parts). We could separate the intellectual property value from the commercial
value, that is, separate design from commercial exploitation. First we have a
working group developing a case study, obtaining a result and protecting it by
filing a patent application. As far as we are concerned, we already have what we
wish for our purposes, the case study. Then, anyone can license the patent if
they so wish - members of the working group could do so for nothing or a
symbolic fee, others for its full value, hence the developers have a competitive
advantage if they wish to exploit it commercially. Can we do this?</p>
</font>
</p><ul>
  <li>If we have a team of systematic innovation experts, food
    researchers and one industrial company (or more in a complementing, not
    competitive, role) working one case study, this might work. Why would the
    company or companies be involved? Would they not prefer to do this on their
    own and have full protection of the results? There are such situations: for
    instance the EU collaborative projects. If the idea is still somewhat
    tentative, is originating somewhere else (a university?) and the outcome a
    bit uncertain, the fact that someone picks up part of the bill may be
    attractive. Otherwise, the industrial companies would have to pay the full
    development costs - something they prefer to do when the cost-risk-benefit
    ratios are clearly favourable.</li>
  <li>Another similar situation is the “business” of incubation
    companies seen from the eyes of venture capitalists: start-up companies in
    incubators are like flowers growing from seed, and when they have matured
    sufficiently for the colours and aroma to blossom, the venture capitalists
    pick up those they like.</li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the first case, we would envisage collaborative R&amp;D
projects submitted to the EU 5th Framework (for instance, a CRAFT-type of
project) or to national agencies (like Enterprise Ireland in Eire). An active
network will help to facilitate setting up such initiatives. The output of these
projects could be a product/process patent. It is also possible to promote an
overall project like a concerted action, managing various individual projects.
The concertation level provides orientation and support on the deployment of
systematic innovation tools, and each individual project generates its own
intellectual property, belonging to the specific working group. This would be
more effective than a series of loose initiatives running totally independently.
We need a good network for this: systematic innovation experts to provide
consultancy and orientation, food research performers, and industrial companies,
each of which championing one specific project. The concertation level could be
the subject of an EU proposal, while each individual project would seek funding
in national agencies supporting industrial innovation.</p>
<font size="2">
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the second case, we could be working a bit more upstream.
Many university food science and cognate programmes have a final year project
that consists of a new product or process development. If some of these would be
mentored by an industrial company, they could be worked with an industrial
orientation, towards industrial goals. A given company could mentor various
projects. Each will not necessarily lead to a good case study and relevant
intellectual property value, but if we run a network all over Europe, we might
end up with a number of good results. This could tie up with a motivating
initiative for the students, like awards given by the network, for instance:
best QFD analysis, best deployment of scientific effects to solve product design
problems, best application of TRIZ concepts, best product optimisation with
Taguchi </p>
<font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">method, best Kansei-based design, etc. Stirring international
competition would incentive each group to excel. The intellectual property value
eventually generated would lie with the University and company involved in each
case. Again, we need a good network with committed Universities and industrial
companies, assisted by systematic innovation experts.</p>

<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.2.3. Development of a technology foresight exercise
concerning the European Food Industry</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the TRIZ techniques that stirred some interest at the
Workshop was the ability to perform a foresight exercise based on “learning from
others” instead of speculation.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A foresight exercise is very simple. We just need to answer
three questions: where are we? where are we going to? how are we going to get
there? (the “why” question is optional...).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first and third are not very difficult to address
objectively: where we are can be extracted from solid data; once we define where
we are moving to, it may not be too difficult to objectively see the type of
things that need to be done to get there. The speculative and highly subjective
exercise is to answer the second question. Diametrically opposing views of where
we are going tend to emerge from different individuals, specially if we are
addressing very specific issues (consensus on “big pictures” are easier). Even
the same individual can “change his mind” with time.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the general patterns of evolution that have been
repeating across sectors of industry and areas of science, TRIZ enables
technology foresight based on simply saying that we will be going in the same
direction that everyone always goes from the particular point where we now
stand. This was performed for the Textile Industry by North Carolina State
University College of Textiles (foresight on yarn spinning technology, see
Gahide, S., TRIZ Journal, July 2000). The WOIS concept combines TRIZ with other
tools to help specify “where we are” more comprehensively in a way that enables
us to move to the “general level of knowledge” (see the Workshop Proceedings).
Kowalik proposes a similarly comprehensive combination of TRIZ, QFD, Taguchi and
functional cost analysis in the AFTER technique (Algorithm for Forecasting
Technology Evolution Roadmaps - see TRIZ Journal, January 1997).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Performing a foresight exercise would provide a good case
study on the application of TRIZ-type techniques and thinking models. This is a
type of study that may fit nicely in the Accompanying Measures provision of the
5th Framework programme of the EU.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>3.2.4. Development of “food inventive principles”</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When TRIZ was applied to business problems and to social
problems for the first time, the developers found it useful to start by
translating the 40 inventive principles initially proposed by Altschuller to
their specific environment. It is therefore logical to do the same thing for
food processing as a helpful starting point to assist TRIZ training to food
developers. The exercise consists of thinking about examples in the food
industry world that fit each of the principles, which is to do exactly the
opposite of what Altschuller did when he developed TRIZ.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a type of work that can be done by a small working
group interacting virtually. However, it is important to note an important
limitation: the original 40 inventive principles of Altschuller were not
developed for biological problems, but for mechanical and engineering problems.
The parallels that can be drawn from the food industry world may turn out to be
too focused on equipment and physical problems, and will not necessarily include
all relevant examples of inventive principles applied to foods. A food developer
reading the 40 principles may think that there is not that much value in TRIZ
because one might fail to find important things, and could find some that seem
rather trivial. These “translations” are a good working tool, specially to
explain concepts and interface food developers and systematic innovation
trainers, but could have a counterproductive effect if they are shown as a final
result.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What would certainly be of significant value would be a
comprehensive set of food inventive principles, covering all effects of
interest, from physical to enzymic and biological dimensions. After the original
40 principles, Altschuller and others worked on other sets of principles:
geometry, chemistry, etc. - why not do it for food processing? It is reported
that some Russian experts are working towards a set of biological principles.
The Invention Machine Corp. software includes enzyme technology and
biotechnology principles. However, so far there is nothing that was developed
specifically with food in mind. The variability of biological behaviour in food
matrices is a concern, and the adverse side effects of a given action are
another (e.g. solving a process design problem that inadvertently results in
decreased safety margins). It may be necessary to move to the molecular level to
express “food inventive principles”. Furthermore, process design is only one
part of the picture for the food industry, product design is just as, if not
more, important. The food inventive principles would need to include not only
“how do we design the process to meet product targets”, but also “how do we
formulate the product to meet the targets”, and both these questions interact.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the moment, this problem is ill-defined. We do not know
yet what can be achieved with existing tools and translation of the general
principles to food problems; we are not sure of what type of systematisation we
would need for a comprehensive set of food principles; the knowledge of
factor-effect relationships at molecular level is still being developed in some
cases - there is a fair number of food patents that we honestly do not know
exactly why they work the way they do, and that could give good results for some
foods, but not for others (there is a fair amount of empiricism in food science,
stemming from thousands of years of culinary experience). If someone would
embark on such an ambitious task, processing food patents one after the other
and building a systematic set of inventive principles, this would certainly be
interesting. However, it is a massive task for an uncertain outcome of unknown
added value (we do not know yet what we can achieve with existing systematic
innovation systems). It therefore seems logical that this comprehensive effort
will only arise if and when more experience in the use of systematic innovation
for food product and process development would generate a critical mass of
interest for such venture.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.2.5. Incorporation of systematic innovation tools and
problem-solving orientation in university programmes</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is worthwhile to challenge Universities and industrial
companies to work together more closely to bring the new thinking models and
work approaches of TRIZ and systematic innovation to the “food table”. What does
industry need from university graduates? Science, technology &amp; management
capabilities? Surely! This is such a basic necessity that it almost goes without
saying. But what is it needed for? What does industry expect its staff to be
able to do with their scientific capabilities? To a large extent, industry wants
them to solve problems. What product should we launch this year? How can we make
this product a greater market success? What should be our business strategy for
the next 5 years? How can we manufacture our product cheaply? How can we
optimise our production? How can we minimise downtime? etc.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An essential point to remember is that while one needs a
strong scientific (technological, managerial...) background to solve problems,
one can have a strong scientific capability and be very poor at solving
problems. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problem solving has its own “science”. We are witnessing the
emergence of what is called “knowledge science”: how do you work with your
knowledge, and that of others, effectively? How do you incorporate the knowledge
of consumers in product design? How do you get it in a way that you can indeed
incorporate it in a product/process design? How can you deploy world-wide
knowledge effectively, across sectors of industry and areas of science, to solve
design problems (including optimisation)? what knowledge do you need to optimise
your supply chain and how do you process it?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most engineering and food science &amp; technology undergraduate
programmes in Europe promote problem solving skills to some extent in final year
projects focusing on new product development or new process design. Some stress
problem solving and knowledge integration in other parts of their training
programmes as well. However, few seem to have moved towards training students in
effective working methods and tools for systematic process and product design.
How many university projects of this nature used a QFD analysis to design the
products? How many thought about using Kansei to specify product design targets?
How many used the Stage Gate process for managing their product development
projects? How many used TRIZ to optimise the process design? How many used a
robust design method, such as Taguchi, Pareto charts, etc. to optimise their
products? etc. Should we not improve this?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From Altschuller’s work we know that one can learn to be an
innovator. So, if we want more innovators in the Food Industry, we have to start
teaching people to be so.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where is the industry in this? It is too weak to address
problem solving without a real-life orientation. We envisage the ability to
solve real problems, with all its multidimensional complexity, not simulated
problems that just illustrate a couple of points that we wish to put across.
This type of student project work should be oriented by industry, the students
should work with an industrial company to develop their design project. This is
certainly the most effective manner.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hence, we envisage the need for an active co-operation
between universities and industrial companies for a long term sustainability of
supply of innovators to the Food Industry.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Implementing this orientation lies with each individual
University. A very effective starting point would be the incorporation of
systematic innovation in product and process development projects of final year
students, or postgraduates, described in section 3.2.2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<u><b>
<p>3.3. Action plan to promote the initiatives</p>
</b></u><b>
<p>3.3.1. General needs: creation of an international network</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The core element of a concerted strategy is a network to
co-ordinate and disseminate the individual efforts, and canvass for support.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A strong network is crucial for credibility and chances of
success for funding. The strategies for R&amp;D funding in EU and national
programmes are continuously evolving. The best approach at present is not to
find a sponsor with a programme to which we can submit one loose proposal and
then gather partners specifically for it, but to have very clear ideas of what
we want to do, have a very strong and credibly partnership who wants to do it,
and then find the right sponsors for the various elements that we wish to
materialise. Good ideas attract good support.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When conceiving a network, it is worthwhile to consider the
opportunity of doing so in co-operation with associations that could provide
solid anchor points, for instance, the ETRIA (European TRIZ Association) for the
systematic innovation trainers and EFFoST (or IFST ?) for the food industry -
our network could be an intersection between two associations and a joint
project of them.</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The action plan is the following:</p>
    </i></font>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Starting from the Workshop participants,

<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.3.2. Design and delivery of a comprehensive training
programme on systematic innovation tools for industry developers </p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The type of work involved is reminiscent of the objectives of
EU programmes such as Leonardo and national programmes for improvement of human
resources and professional development. A concerted effort at international
level to design and run pilot courses would need financial support, and it
should be explored whether the Leonardo programme would be a suitable source.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inclusion of this type of courses in professional
development programmes such as those that may soon become mandatory for
engineers, or that are voluntary (like the professional development strategy
advised by the Institute of Food Science and Technology, U.K.), could help to
potentiate the multiplier effect and achieve long term sustainability.</p>

<p>4. Conclusion</p>
</b></u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot expect the European Food Industry to dramatically
increase innovation output without significant and suitable human resources, who
think creatively and innovatively but without increasing cost nor risk with such
thoughts. We will never achieve that if everyone works only incrementally in
their area of expertise with their own way of thinking.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot expect the European food industry to multiply its
innovation activities with the profit margins it works with unless very
cost-effective methods and tools are deployed. We will not decrease risk and
improve success in innovation if we do not have objective and systematic ways to
incorporate the needs and requirements of the consumers in product design, and
to solve the manufacturing problems of that design.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is something in the “innovation equation” that does not
add up. We could increase the innovation expenditure in the European food
industry exponentially and reap noting but incremental benefits here and there.
The basis has to change. We have to improve the working methods and the way that
developers work, define, and solve their problems: we need the ability to think
integratedly; to link design attributes with process solutions (not with process
problems); to be able to “learn from others”; to work multidimensionally in an
effective manner - we need better ways to manage and work with our knowledge and
that of the consumers.</p>

</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless we change something in how we do things, we will keep
doing them in the same way, and keep having the same results. We will have “more
of the same”. If we aim at incorporating more science and technology (more
knowledge) in food products and keep doing it in the same way, we can only
expect the level of success that we have been having so far. And that is not
enough.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us propose a very basic benchmarking concept. Let us look
at those who are highly innovative, at industrial sectors where innovation is
the name of the game, at product and process designers who very actively and
effectively deliver innovations. How do they do it? How do they work with
knowledge and technology? And how can we do that in our own specific context?</p>
<font size="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the perspective of this report, and the strategy
proposed aims at achieving this objective. We are not looking at how we work and
make it better, incrementally improving here and there. We propose to aim at
ideality, and then make it true as much as possible.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The “ideal” vision of an innovative Food Industry is very
simple: consumer requirements are objectively translated into quantifiable
product targets, these are met by an optimised manufacturing process designed
effectively to comply with all design targets without compromising any of the
relevant aspects of food products of that type, and all this is done mostly from
scientific knowledge, with only some experimentation to produce prototypes and
smoothen out the rough edges. In process design, we consider all relevant
alternatives and choose the very best. In product design we may consider
different aspects with equal facility: e.g. sensory, convenience of use,
functionality (in human metabolism). Just imagine: marketing defines that we
want a product that looks like this, tastes like this, and does this to the
human body; and the product development team says “no problem”, and comes up
with the result in a couple of months.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This “paradise” scenario may look too farfetched for food,
but others do it. How? could we move in that direction as well?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Systematic innovation is not just TRIZ, but TRIZ is an
excellent starting point to think differently, which will move us in the right
direction. Product design tools such as QFD might be easy for a food product
developer to master, but even they can be used a lot more effectively with the
functional analysis capabilities that TRIZ brings to the thinking methods. We
must implement TRIZ tools as part of our working methods, but develop in an
equally strong manner the problem definition (product design) tools. While
seeing TRIZ as an important starting point to promote systematic innovation
concepts, we envisage a much more comprehensive development of systematic
innovation tools, and we need to explore other emerging concepts in this area
too. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The implementation of the initiatives outlined in this
proposal could give a significant contribution to improving the innovation
environment of the European Food Industry. This is such an embracive objective
that it only makes sense to state it in the intent of building a network of
industrial companies and R&amp;D performers to develop and disseminate these
initiatives. The value of a European network of food innovators and
problem-solvers cannot be overstated. This Accompanying Measure created an
embryo, but the development depends on the success of the network to continue to
work together and bring more partners around specific initiatives to bring the
work forward. It is considered that anchoring this network by linking to
international associations in the food and in the systematic innovation area can
be beneficial.</p>
<p>Let us move forward. Expressions of interest are welcome.</p>
