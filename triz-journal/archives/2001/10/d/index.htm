<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Background of the situation: </p>
</font><font size="2"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b></font>It is known that<font size="2"><b> </b></font>
harvesting has become increasingly automated, improving productivity and
reducing human intensive labour. However, despite these efforts for automation,
some areas still need improvement and new ideas. An example of this is a stage
within the process of potato harvesting- the process used in the separation of
freshly harvested potatoes from soil lumps, stones and other undesirable
byproducts. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although there are a few patents relating to this process,
the results are not satisfactory, thus new patents are being applied and
published from many different countries. The state of the art is based mainly in
trying to take advantage of any difference between potatoes and other bodies.
Thus, one can find patents based in the shaking and sifting of the gathered
matter in order to take advantage of the different resting positions of the
root, and the plant and loose ground can then be easily removed using these
methods. However, such methods are not effective in separating stones or in the
even more difficult process of separating soil lumps. Patents with such a focus
are for example, <i>US5425459<b> </b>“ Stone separation table for potatoes and
other root crops</i> “ or <i>US3625290 “Separating apparatus for mobile potato
harvesting vehicle</i>” that uses water as a means to separate by density
differences.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Altshuller (1), father of TRIZ and theoretical mentor of TRIZ
practitioners, reminds us of the limited value of concentrating on physical
differences in his example of the separation of wooden chips into wood and bark,
instead of applying a true S-field. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this sense, others applying (probably without noticing)
S-fields, try to look for different techniques. There are curious methods using
different fields like acoustic fields, even nuclear fields or X-rays fields.
Although these apply s-fields to some extent (beam, potato or body and a
detector), most of the time they focus on differences which are not significant,
allowing inaccuracy in selecting potatoes. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within this category we can find patents like <i>US4466543 “
Method and device for distinguishing between field crops, particularly potatoes
on one hand and stone or clods of soil on the other hand</i><b>.” </b>that uses
a magnetic field for distinguishing potatoes, or <i>US3675769</i> “<i>Method and
apparatus for separating potatoes from stones and soil clods”</i> which uses two
light beams one visible and one infrared as fields,<i> </i>or<i> US4466543</i>
which uses an acoustic field to detect different responses to said field. Patent
<i>USRE31660</i>, uses a mechanical field, vibrations, to see the differences
betwen the response of potatoes or stones to that field. The Spanish patent
2112118 allows potatoes and lumps or stones fall onto a membrane whose vibration
produces different sounds enabling the selection. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All these patents use fields but only take advantages of the
different responses to the different fields used.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us try to make a functional analysis of the problem using
Invention Machine’s TechOptimizer 3.5:</p>

<p align="left">Fig. 2: The problem once a field has been added and
differences in response is the solution.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead of focusing on differences let us start applying
TRIZ, both Altshuller’s inventive principles and S-Fields.</p>
<p>If we use the engineering parameters to improve some of the following:</p>

<p>And cross -reference several of the following parameters as the worsening
features:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The matrix presents us with the following principles which we
will now consider:</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <font FACE="Symbol">
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">· </font>Principle: 22 - <b>'Blessing in disguise'</b>,
        turning lemon into lemonades</p>
        <font FACE="Symbol">
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">· </font>Principle: 1- <b>Segmentation</b>:</p>
        <dir>
          <dir>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">• Divide an object into independent parts</p>
          </dir>
        </dir>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">• <u>Make an object easy to disassemble </p>
        <dir>
          <dir>
            </u>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">• Increase the degree of fragmentation (or
            segmentation) of an object</p>
          </dir>
        </dir>
        <font FACE="Symbol">
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">· </font>Principle 9: <b>Preliminary counteraction or
        anti-action</p>
        </b><font FACE="Symbol">
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">· </font>Principle 10: <b>Preliminary action</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    </b>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">• Perform, before it is needed, the required change of an
    object (either fully or partially),</p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <dir>
          <dir>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">• Pre-arrange objects conveniently such that they
            can come into action quickly without losing time during delivery.</p>
            <font FACE="Courier New"></font>
          </dir>
        </dir>
      </dir>
    </dir>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Principle 22 states that if something produces a harmful
action then increasing the harmful action may be beneficial. This focuses our
attention on the inherent moisture and the soil lumps. If some water causes the
formation of the soil lumps, an excess of water can benefit not by easing the
selection but by clearing the lumps! Thus eliminating the need for selection.
</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we can see the matrix directs us to a different concept,
instead of sorting out and separating the problem, let us make the problem
disappear. Now our focus should be not in differentiating but in destroying or
‘dissolving’ soil lumps. As humidity is not advantageous for string potatoes, we
should dry the potatoes afterwards. Using existing resources, we could use air
heated by the harvesting machine engine, to dry the potatoes.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="1a"></a>TRIZ is a very comprehensive method because we could have
arrived at the same conclusions using different ways like using S-fields and the
76 standard solutions or simply by using the TRIZ based TechOptimizer Software
trimming function. We could also arrive at similar conclusions using the ‘object
removal’ technique and the ‘unification’ technique of A.S.I.T<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To destroy the lumps in a water medium we could address
differences in mechanical fields, among other solutions, displayed in the
functional tree of the TechOptimiser software, like ultrasonic vibrations or
acoustic waves. If we take the evolution trends, we could think of utilizing the
mean frequency of the lumps and use resonance to destroy them, provided it is
not the same frequency as the potato!</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image123.gif" width="345" height="255"></p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Phenomena like cavitation, bubbles or the force of water jets
could also be applied to destroy lumps without destroying the potatoes, thus
making separation afterwards, very easy.</p>
<font size="2"></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we take inventive principle 22 segmentation, especially
the sentence “<i>make an object easy to disassemble</i>”, we could try to make
lumps easy to disassemble (still inheriting the idea of clearing instead of
sorting). Everybody can think of a possible solution but let us resist the
temptation and go further with the method</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Principle 9 and 10 may also give us the idea to prepare the
soil at the start of the process, when seeding, before harvesting. If there is a
harmful action (building up of lumps) let us prepare a counteraction.</p>
<p>Taking the S-field model, we have a ‘bad’ S-field:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="1" src="04a.gif" width="201" height="96"></p>
<b>
<p align="left">Fig.3: ‘Bad’ S-field:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then we can apply for instance, standard solution nº 1.2.3</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“If the harmful action is caused by a field, then introduce
an element S3 to absorb the harmful effects.” </p>
</i><sub></sub>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, spreading some cheap polymer (see recycled
materials) ‘pearls’ or particles to the ground, that disturb the structure of
the lumps, preventing them, without distorting the ability of potato roots, to
absorb water and nutrients, and thus make it easy to dissolve any remaining
lumps, later on.</p>
<sub></sub>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are only a few ways to apply standard TRIZ principles,
and enhanced with the help of tools like Invention Machine’s TechOptimizer, many
expert solutions could be applied to the processing problem. There are plenty of
areas where TRIZ can be applied to uncover new approaches. Advances need change,
and new ideas are needed for that change to become reality!</p>
