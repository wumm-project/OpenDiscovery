<P>By <A href="#authors">Mi Jeong Song, Vasily Lenyashin and Jeong Wook Lee</A></P><H2>Abstract</H2><P>A light emitting diode (LED) is a semi-conductor device, which emits light by electrons moving from a point of high energy to a point of low energy when electric power is applied to it. LEDs&nbsp;are in widespread use – from cell phones to automobile lights. Increasing efficiency is one of biggest issues facing LEDs. There are several causes for decreasing light efficiency. One of the most serious sources of light loss lies with low extraction efficiency. Root cause analysis revealed that total internal reflection between a GaN/sapphire interface is the main source of low efficiency (harmful effect). By formulating technical contradictions around this issue, we suggest more than 30 fresh ideas, among which three were selected for feasibility test and prior art search. All three fresh ideas have increased light extraction efficiencies at a minimum of 40 percent. Two of the ideas were filed as patents, which were integrated into commercial LED chips successfully in October 2006. Other ideas (that were not accepted at that time) have been seed for further research and development milestones of the LED project team.</P><H2>What is GaN LED?</H2><P>A light emitting diode (LED) is an illuminating semi-conductor diode device. In a diode system, current flows easily from the p-side (anode) to the n-side (cathode) but not in the reverse direction.<SUP><A href="#ref1">1</A></SUP> Charge carriers – electrons and holes – flow and meet together in a p-n junction. When an electron meets a hole in the p-n junction, it falls to a lower energy level and releases energy in the form of light. The wavelength of the emitting light (color) depends on the band gap energy of the materials forming the p-n junction. The direct band gap of LED material determines the wavelengths of the emissions from near-infrared light to vis/near-ultraviolet light.</P><P>Since the mid-1990s, GaN has been of great interest because of its potential for optoelectronic application – for light emitting diodes, laser diodes (LD), LCD backlights, etc.<SUP><A href="#ref2">2</A></SUP> Figure 1 shows the typical structure of an LED system – GaN, which comprises light emitting p-n junction (usually called the active layer), n-layer, p-layer, n-electrode, p-electrode and&nbsp;sapphire substrate.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 1:</B> Conventional GaN Light Emitting Diode</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><FONT size=+0><IMG height=237 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2007-11-0401.gif" width=355 border=0></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><H2>LED Problems</H2><P><FONT size=2>The light generating efficiency of an LED chip depends on three different efficiencies designated in the following formula:</FONT></P><BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Symbol>h</FONT><SUB><FONT face=Arial>WPE</FONT></SUB> = <FONT face=Symbol>h</FONT><FONT face=Arial><SUB>i </SUB>x </FONT><FONT face=Symbol>h</FONT><FONT face=Arial><SUB>ex</SUB> x </FONT><FONT face=Symbol>h</FONT><FONT face=Arial><SUB>el </SUB>–&nbsp;<SUB> </SUB>w</FONT></FONT>here <FONT face=Symbol size=2>h</FONT><SUB>WPE</SUB> = wall plug efficiency of chip, <FONT face=Symbol size=2>h</FONT><SUB>i</SUB> = internal quantum efficiency, <FONT face=Symbol size=2>h</FONT><SUB>ex</SUB> = extraction efficiency and <FONT face=Symbol size=2>h</FONT><SUB>el </SUB>= electrical efficiency</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The internal efficiency is light generation efficiency that relies on semi-conducting material, dopant material, nano-structure of material (e.g., defects) and so on.

After identifying the critical thread of root causes, it was necessary to understand the physical effects – total internal reflection – which had a main role in the harmful effect chain.</FONT></P><P>To understand the why and where of the problem, it was necessary to understand the nature of the total internal reflection phenomena more deeply. When light comes from a medium with a high refractive index to a medium with a lower refractive index, the light bends toward an interface direction (i.e., away from the normal direction). In this case, the exit angle from the normal direction is always bigger than the incident angle of the light. As the incident angle becomes larger, the exit angle approaches 90°. For some angles greater than the critical incident angle øc, the light cannot go out from the first media – the light is kept in the first media. There is a risk of such total internal reflection where two types of media meet, which have different refractive indices. In LED, the incident lights a perpendicular pathway from the substrate/LED inter-facial layer.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 4:</B> Total Internal Reflection</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"><IMG height=181 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2007-11-0404.gif" width=279 border=0></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><H2>Where Is the Problem Most Serious?</H2><P><FONT size=2>Total internal reflection explains why LEDs had low extraction efficiency.

The TRIZ specialist must guide domain experts to externalize core problems of the system correctly, not because TRIZ is not useful, but because TRIZ itself cannot understand a problem's structure.</P><H2>Transition Actions to Solve Identified Root Causes</H2><P>After coming to a consensus on the root cause of the system, it is time to suggest a primary solution to eliminate the problem – the transition action.<SUP><A href="#ref8">8</A></SUP> The most interesting feature of a known solution is a method of changing interface geometry to change a critical angle of total internal reflection. This transition action solves identified root causes to understand where to go, i.e., to set up a problem solving strategy.</P><P>The ELOG (epitaxial lateral overgrowth, seen right in Figure 6) technique and PSS (patterned sapphire substrate, left in Figure 6)&nbsp;technique were useful for reducing the total internal reflection between sapphire substrate and GaN.<SUP><A href="#ref9">9</A>,<A href="#ref10">10</A>,<A href="#ref11">11</A></SUP> The original purpose of these two techniques was to reduce dislocation density during crystal epitaxial growth. The primary effect of these two techniques is increasing the internal quantum efficiency by reducing defects of the crystal. The enhancement of light extraction efficiency is a secondary effect of the suggested technologies.</P><P>But these techniques had inherent problems. ELOG needs the introduction of an additional SiO2 mask layer on the sapphire substrate, which enhances manufacturing complexity. PSS is a more advanced technique than ELOG because an additional mask is not necessary. But the conventional PSS process has poor manufacturing efficiency. When growing the semi-conductor crystal layer on the conventionally patterned sapphire substrate, a planarization process (creation of an even surface) was necessary after facet growth occurred on the pattern. The facet grows on the top and bottom parts of the pattern; crystal re-grows to planar surface – a thick layer is necessary. Another disadvantage of the conventional PSS technique is void formation on the interface of sapphire substrate and GaN. Lateral growth speed is faster than vertical growth speed in GaN semiconductor epitaxial growth. Rapid lateral growth on the conventional groove pattern leads to void formation.</P><H2>Formulating Problem Model</H2><P>To formulate a problem model, it is necessary to summarize the collected information. The beginning of the project started with the undesirable feature of the LED system.&nbsp;Figure 7&nbsp;shows several descriptions about the cause of the problem, the known way to resolve said problem, and the problem of the known method – in other words, showing why using known ways is not an ideal solution.<SUP><A href="#ref8">8</A></SUP></P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 7:</B> Problem Formulating Table: Substrate Modification</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=360 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2007-11-0407.gif" width=550 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>Figure 7 shows the knowledge of the undesirable function (point 1), the reason to eliminate the undesirable function (point 2), and the cause of the undesirable function (point 3). Point 4 is the starting point of active analysis – where transition action was used to work on the identified and undesirable feature of the problem's origin. At point 5, analyses of drawbacks of such transition actions and/or why the known transition action to eliminate undesirable function could not be used. Figure 7 not only summarizes the problem formulation, but also provides a template for problem model formulation.</P><P>A technical contradiction could be defined at any hierarchy in a system/problem complex denoted in a root cause analysis diagram.

Known solutions (i.e., transition action for the total internal reflection) were critically surveyed in a problem formulation table. Contradictions caused by transition actions were formulated and resolved with the guidance of inventive principles that suggested conceptual guidelines for technical contradiction. More than 20 useful ideas were developed with the aid of the inventive principles. Many ideas have proven excellent performers for light extraction – up to a 60 percent increase. Two ideas were filed up as U.S. patents and served as an important technology for real LED chip production.</P><H2>Epilogue</H2><P>This project was executed from May-September 2003. More than 25 technical ideas were suggested; two were filed as international patents. One concept created by this project was introduced in a real LED system produced by Samsung Electromechanics, Inc. With the aid of TRIZ, the "light extraction efficiency of LED is low" problem was understood more thoroughly and the solutions for the problem more easily developed. The LED division of Samsung Electromechanics then released brighter LED-based backlight units for cell phones in 2006.<SUP><A href="#ref16">16</A></SUP></P><P>At the end of the process, the TRIZ practitioners forecasted the near future of the LED system. According to the pattern of an increasing segmentation level, the light extraction structure will become smaller until reaching nano-level. Current papers and patents are looking at nano-structure in many areas. The rapid realization of the suggested ideas was aided by statistical assistance of Six Sigma.</P><H2>Acknowledgments</H2><P>Special thanks to Dr. Yoon, Suk Ho, Dr. Kim, Hyun Soo, Mr. Cho, Je Hee, Dr. Son and Chul Soo for their enthusiastic supports of TRIZ, idea development and realization.
