Make an object or system easy to disassemble. </P><LI>Institute fast response team for handling urgent customer issue. <P></P><P>C. Increase the degree of fragmentation or segmentation. </P><LI>Mass customization: each customer is a market. <LI><A href="http://www.isixsigma&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/dictionary/Failure_Modes_and_Effects_Analysis_FMEA-86.htm">Failure Mode and Effects Analysis</A> (FMEA). <LI>Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). <P></P><P>D. Transition to micro-level. </P><LI>Use mini-kits for product advertisement. <LI>Describe product function in advertisement on molecular level (e.g., drugs, cosmetics, food, etc). <P></P><H2>Principle 2.
