<P>By <A href="#authors">Gregory Frenklach</A></P><H2>Introduction</H2><P>Historically, each TRIZ tool was developed (and could be used)&nbsp;independently for problem solving. That is why each tool had its own mini-algorithm. Trials to bring them to work together (e.g., with ARIZ) were not enough, in my opinion. </P><P>This work is&nbsp;a revision of the main TRIZ tools so that they work together as parts of the same system. The presented algorithm consists of three main parts. (There are four additional parts, explained in Appendices 4-7, which are intended to help overcome possible difficulties with the application of the main parts of the algorithm).</P><P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">The main parts are:</P><UL><LI>Problem formulation <LI>TRIZ tool search <LI>Searching for the idea of solution</LI></UL><P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">The additional parts are:</P><UL dir=ltr><LI>Overcoming psychological inertia (Appendix 4) <LI>Overcoming restrictions (Appendix 5) <LI>Problem reformulating (Appendix 6) <LI>Evaluation and development of the idea of solution (Appendix 7)</LI></UL><H2 dir=ltr><BR>Problem Formulation [9]</H2><P>Describe the situation in a simple and understandable way, using words and expressions that will be clear to an inexperienced person.
