Services provide a particular challenge to conceptualization techniques, as they encompass, in a general sense, elements (as opposed to physical components) such the following</FONT></P><UL><LI><FONT size=2>Persons (product designer, service provider, service supporter, customer, client, consultant, expert)</FONT> <LI><FONT size=2>Tangibles (physical products, components, parts, facility, amenity, equipment, furnishings)</FONT> <LI><FONT size=2>Intangibles (goals, service environment, external environment, information environment)</FONT> <LI><FONT size=2>Activities (processes, events, systems, functions)</FONT></LI></UL><P><FONT size=2>Because of the wide range of elements constituting a service, architecture is useful for formalizing the representation of a service. We provide this formalization by means of a taxonomic model or service capstone model. This model constitutes a framework into which the conceptualized elements can be pigeon-holed. On the other hand, the multiplicity of elements requires a powerful method to trigger ideas for a solution – and this is provided by the 40 inventive principles of TRIZ. </FONT></P><P><FONT size=2>This paper presents a methodology that integrates these two aspects and provides an innovative procedure for developing a new service.</FONT></P><H2>Taxonomic Definition of a Service System</H2><P>A service system is an organized set of processes that transforms inputs into outputs; the system achieves an organizational purpose and meets the need of customers through the use of human, physical and informatic enablers in a sociological and physical environment).<SUP><A href="#note2">2</A>,<A href="#note3">3</A></SUP> It is structured as a set of nine interlinked classes of objects:</P><OL><LI>Customers:those benefiting from the service (or otherwise affected by it) <LI>Goals: aims, purposes or central meaning of service provision for the organization and its customers <LI>Inputs:&nbsp;physical, human, financial or informational elements to be serviced <LI>Outputs:&nbsp;physical, informational or human elements after being serviced <LI>Processes:service provision and support activities <LI>Human enablers:human resources owning and/or providing the service <LI>Physical enablers: physical and technological facilities and resources which aid in providing the service <LI>Informatic enablers:information and knowledge resources supporting the service <LI>Environment – physical, economic, technological, social, ecological or legal factors and contexts influencing the service</LI></OL><P>These nine categories, or major classes, of service system elements are decomposed into 75 basic features, or main classes, within these categories (<A href="#app4">Appendix 4</A>). These features are further decomposed into more than 400 elements (<A href="#app1">Appendix 1</A>), which constitute our basic unit of design. The taxonomy was developed on the basis of an extensive literature review in the service domain&nbsp;and has been extensively updated as a result of study of the integration of the service taxonomy and TRIZ.<SUP><A href="#note2">2</A>,<A href="#note3">3</A></SUP></P><H2>Integration of the Service Taxonomy and TRIZ Principles</H2><P>We applied our ideas of integration to the conceptualization of the elements in the case of an after-sales service facility. We used the TRIZ principles and the three-level taxonomy at the element level to trigger ideas. We had three goals in mind: 1) to test whether fruitful ideas could be triggered by each principle and sub-principle, 2) to demonstrate that each idea could be linked to the taxonomy and 3) to verify that the two approaches could be advantageously integrated.</P><P>Our scheme incorporates, as far as possible, a super-set of the sub-principles appearing in the various articles to test the power of TRIZ in generating ideas at the element level. (The outcome of this part of our study is detailed in <A href="#app3">Appendix 3</A>.) It resulted in the utilization of all 100 sub-principles and the generation of close to 200 elements, all linked to the major and main classes of the taxonomy. This encouraged us to develop a formalized procedure for generating ideas by selecting a feature or element and applying the inventive principles to it. Idea generation can happen by one of two methods: 1) use of the contradiction matrix or 2) using the proposed procedure, selecting a promising inventive principle.</P><H3>Option One: Contradiction

The designer, with the aid of the service taxonomy, begins to visualize the service as a compilation of elements, which needs to be specified. In order to specify the elements, questions must be asked about the elements. In this way, a satisfactory (regular) design – and even innovative (creative) design – solution to the requirement can be found. A powerful and integrated method is needed to both identify and specify these hundreds of elements. A solution is the combination of a comprehensive service taxonomy (in the form of a three-level capstone model) and the 40 inventive principles. This is provided by combining a comprehensive service taxonomy, in the form of a three-level capstone model, the 40 inventive principles and the contradiction matrix. With and without the contradiction matrix demonstrates that both approaches are highly effective in service design.</P><H2>References</H2><OL><LI><A name=note1></A>Goldstein, S.M., Johnston, R., Duffy J., Rao, J., "The Service Concept: The Missing Link in Service Design Research?," <EM>Journal of Operations Management</EM>, 20, 121-134, 2000. <LI><A name=note2></A>Kaner, M., Karni, R, "Engineering Design of a Service System – An Empirical Study," <EM>Information&nbsp;Knowledge&nbsp;Systems&nbsp;Management</EM>, 6, 235-263, 2007. <LI><A name=note3></A>Karni, R., Kaner, M., "An Engineering Tool for the Conceptual Design of Service Systems," in Spath, D., Fähnrich, K.-P.

He developed and taught a course in engineering design for industrial engineers at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology. During a sabbatical at George Mason University in 1995, Karni became acquainted with TRIZ as a product design methodology and also began research into design tools for service engineering; in particular, knowledge-based inferential design theory. A further sabbatical was spent in 2005 at the Service Engineering Unit of the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart, Germany, where research into a comprehensive taxonomy resulted in the development of the capstone model for services. His current research interests include service system design and analysis, business process design and analysis, and knowledge process design and analysis. He has recently turned his attention to TRIZ as an effective method to create a more formalized approach to service system design. Contact Reuven Karni at <a href="javascript:sendmail('doreuven','yahoo.com');">doreuven (at) yahoo.com</a>.</p><p>Maya Kaner is a lecturer in industrial engineering and management at the Ort Braude College, Karmiel, Israel. Her M.Sc. research dealt with the idea of a generalized categorization of services and the application of inferential design theory to the ideation of service elements. Her Ph.D. research dealt with knowledge management within project planning and management. Her current research interests include knowledge-based service systems design and modeling, knowledge-based decision-making in project management, and business process modeling. She has collaborated with professor Reuven Karni on 14 journal and international conference articles on the applications of knowledge-based methods in service system design and has recently turned her attention to TRIZ as an effective method to create a more formalized approach to service system design.
