<P>By <A href="#authors">Cao Guozhong</A></P><P>Sponsored by the mechanical design academy of the Chinese mechanical engineering society, the 3rd Senior Conference on TRIZ Researching in China was held at Hebei University of Technology on October 20, 2007. Professor Tan Runhua, vice president of Hebei University of Technology, presided at the conference. More than 50 scholars attended, representing the following groups: TRIZ Korea, Chinese Communist Youth League, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Sichuan University, Tianjin Polytechnic University, Hunan University, Beijing Technology and Business University, University of Jinan, Hebei University, Northeast Forestry University, the Academy of Armored Forces Engineering, Northeastern University, Shandong Jianzhu University, Emerson China (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., Tianjin Creative Studies Institute, Science of Science and Management of S.&.T. and the Design for Innovation in Hebei University of Technology.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 1:</B> Attendees of the 3rd Senior Conference on TRIZ Researching in China</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=376 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2007-12-05%20pic%201.JPG" width=512 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>TRIZ expert Kim Youngi from Korea presented "How to Introduce TRIZ in Organizations," which introduced the research, development and the application of TRIZ in Korea. Dr. Cao Guozhong from Hebei University of Technology reported on "CAI-oriented Study on Effect and its Realization Method" looking at multi-polar effect modeling supporting multi-input and multi-output functions with corresponding software. Dr. Zhu Aibin from Xi'an Jiaotong University gave a report entitled "Discussion of the Relation Between TRIZ and Other Design Theories" that addressed the characteristics and applicable ranges of design theories and their corresponding relations with special problems. Dr. Gao Changqing from Jinan University gave a report on the introduction of development of innovation education. Dr. Ma Lihui from Hebei University gave a speech called "Contradiction Discovery and Solving Method Based on TRIZ Evolution Theory and TOC Prerequisite Tree," which presented a method to determine design contradiction based on TRIZ and the TOC prerequisite tree.</P><P>Professor Tan Runhua from Hebei University of Technology presented "UXDs-driven Contradiction Solving for Conceptual Design Using CAIs." In his speech, Professor Runhua presented situational design and the concept of UXD were introduced along with UXDs-driven contradiction-solving modeling. Dr. Zhang Fuying gave a report on the study of design for systematic innovation of mechanical products, wherein an entire process model of systematic innovation for design was established with the integration of problem-solving methods; realization of ideal final results were objects of innovation, analysis and problem solving as a technical measure. Han Lifang from Shandong Jianzhu University gave a report on "The Study on New 3-dimensions Garage Based on TRIZ." In her report, 3-dimension garage design modeling and its structure were established based on contradiction solving principles of TRIZ. Dr. Wei Zihui from Hebei University of Technology gave a report on the introduction of ARIZ, which detailed the main principle of ARIZ and the problem-solving flow of ARIZ-85C. In addition, Professor Ma Jianhong from Hebei University of Technology presented "Introduction of CAI Software-InventionTool 3.0," which introduced the structure, function and operational flow of this software.</P><H3><A name=authors></a>About the Author:</H3> <p>Cao Guozhong is an associate professor at the School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, PR China. He received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. through the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, in 2003 and 2007. Dr. Guozhong's main research interests include design theory and methodology, software engineering and CAD.
