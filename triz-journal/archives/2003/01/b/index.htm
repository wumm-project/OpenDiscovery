<p>Abstract</p>
</b>
<p>Some teachers of TRIZ, and particularly those who base their teaching method
on the use of ARIZ, have made the claim that higher level solutions to problems
are generated by analyzing the physical contradictions that give rise to the
problem, relative to the solutions generated by addressing the technical
contradictions.</p>
<p>Ontro Inc. has evaluated 319 solved problems related to the technology of
self-heating food containers during the last three years. These cases were used
as a database to evaluate the effectiveness of problem solving from the physical
contradiction and technical contradiction points of view.</p>
<p>Four measures of the level of innovation were developed, with priority given
to solutions that were implemented in products, solutions that resulted in
patents or patent disclosures, and solutions that resulted in declarations of
trade secrecy (and the decision not to pursue patents for competitive reasons).
The highest implementation effectiveness rating was found for problems that had
been analyzed both as physical and technical contradictions. This result has led
to a decision to analyze all problems from both points of view in the future,
regardless of the original formulation of the problem.</p>
<dir>
  <p>1. Introduction</p>
</dir>
<p>Problems are resolvable utilizing a number of solution techniques available
to the TRIZ practitioner. Basic solution techniques may be applied, or as
necessary, advanced techniques may be used. Table 1 divides these techniques
into basic and advanced groups (1,2,3,4,5).</p>

<p>It is Contradiction Matrix Theory (CMT) that is of primary concern in this
research paper.</p>
<dir>
  <p>2. Contradiction Matrix Theory</p>
</dir>
<p>A specific technical problem, when described using the contradiction
approach, may be classified as a technical contradiction (TC), a physical
contradiction (PC), or an administrative contradiction (AC). These
contradictions may be represented utilizing the common phrasing found in Table
2:</p>

<p>The technical and physical contradictions will be addressed to further
prepare the foundation of our discovery.</p>
<dir>
  <p>2.1 Technical Contradiction (TC) </p>
</dir>
<p>Consider two performance characteristics of a technical system (TS) Cp and
Cp�. Also, allow three levels of adjustment for Cp and Cp�; Cp{x,y,z} and
Cp�{a,b,c}. As Cp improves in response to stimuli x, y, and z the resultant Cp�
response is reflected in a negative slope for a, b, and c (1). </p>

</font>
<b>
<p align="left">Figure 1: A graphic representation of a technical
contradiction</p>
</b>
<p>Enhancing the performance for Cp has an inverse effect on Cp�. This
dependence is the central tenant of the technical contradiction. This
inverse-dependence must be broken in order to remove the TC and produce a
solution that will increase the ideality of the system <sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>2.1.1 Contradiction Matrix Theory (CMT)</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>The resolution of the TC follows a simple algorithm where basic steps are
represented in Figure 2:</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image248.gif" width="488" height="282"></p>
</font><b>
<p align="left">Figure 2: CMT Algorithm where steps 2 and 3 are the primary
functioning elements (1,6,7,8).</p>
</b>
<p>The CMT solution space is therefore defined by the matrix structure inherent
in the contradiction matrix:</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image249.gif" width="543" height="273"></p>
</font><b>
<p align="left">Figure 3: CMT Solution Space</p>
</b>
<p>The contradiction definition is highly subjective as the situation may be
defined (within the limited available permutations) in many different manners.
Each problem definition (step 2) yields several innovative principles (40
Principles utilized transitioning from step 2 to step 3) that must be connected
to the specific problem and any potential resolution using <i>analogic thought
</i>(which is very difficult to master for a large sub-set of potential CMT
users).</p>
<dir>
  <p>2.2 Physical Contradiction (PC)</p>
</dir>
<p>Consider a technical system (TS) where there is a requirement for a
characteristic, D, and a requirement for the equivalent anti-characteristic, D-.
A technical system with this bi-polar feature requirement is approachable in the
TRIZ system by employing the following heuristic:</p>

<p>The algorithm for resolution of a physical contradiction is represented in
Figure 4:</p>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p align="left"><img SRC="Image250.gif" width="488" height="282"></p>
</font><b>
<p align="left">Figure 4: Physical Contradiction Algorithm (1,6,7,8)</p>
</b>
<p>This algorithm is devoid of the strong reliance on the analogic thought phase
prevalent in the resolution of a technical contradiction (see Figure 2 Steps 3
and 4). The lack of a solution matrix also allows solution vectoring to progress
in a completely unrestricted manner.</p>
<p>It is important to note that technical contradictions may be converted to
physical contradictions and vice versa. This allows for the possibility of each
problem present in a TS to be assessed utilizing the processes summarized in
Figures 2 and 4. If the solution space for a TC is defined by {T} and the
solution space for a PC is defined by {P} and (from the previous discussion)
{P}&gt;{T}; then [{P}+{T}]&gt;&gt;{P} or {T}. Data to support this conjecture is
presented in the following section.</p>

<p>A log of problems and solutions is kept at Ontro, Inc. This log was utilized
to provide core data for analysis to support (or refute) the aforementioned
conjecture. Table 4 indicates the problems reviewed as categorized by the year
in which they were addressed.</p>

<p>The potential solutions produced during the application of the TRIZ
Methodology were either reduced to practice (implemented) or discarded due to
perceivably insurmountable secondary problems. Those solutions that were
implemented in part or entirety were considered to have been completely
implemented. The implementation strength is presented in Table 8:</p>

<p>Considering the solution density (SOLd) and the solution implementation (SOL
i), several cursory conclusion may be made:</p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Evaluating a problem state as a TC and a PC increases the solution
    density</li>
  <li>Evaluating a problem state as a PC<font FACE="Symbol">�</font>{P}&gt;{T}</li>
  <li>More TC solutions are implemented than PC solutions indicating the
    following possibility: PC solutions are more complex than TC solutions
    (although this is NOT categorically correct).</li>
  <li>{P}&gt;{T}</li>
  <li>[{P}+{T}]&gt;&gt;{P} or {T}</li>
  <li>The implementation of those solutions that are derived from TC and PC
    structure have a higher implementation than those from either PC or TC. This
    may be due to the higher SOLstr associated which would have a tendency to
    command more resources. </li>
</ol>
<p>The strength of the implemented solutions was also considered as an important
component of this evaluation. Altshuller�s Levels of Innovation were utilized as
the metric by which an implemented solution was rated. Table 9 demonstrates the
implemented solution innovative level as a function of TC, PC, or TC and PC:</p>

<p>4. Conclusions:</p>
<p>The solution density, solution strength, and implementation of solutions to
problems that were analyzed both as physical and technical contradictions
yielded higher scores in all three metrics and subsequently the composite score
by <i><b>an order of magnitude</b></i>. Although the problems treated as
physical contradictions had a higher composite score than those analyzed by
technical contradictions, the extremely high composite score of those treated
both way suggests that we should stop trying to decide how to treat a problem,
and treat all problems both ways.</p>
