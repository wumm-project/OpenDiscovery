<b><font color="#ff0000" face="Century"><font size="+1">1. INTRODUCTION</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><font face="Century"><font color="#000000">As a methodology for creative
problem solving, TRIZ (i.e., 'Theory of Inventive Problem Solving' in Russian
abbreviation) </font><font color="#3333ff">[1-5]</font><font color="#000000">
provides a full range of features for freer/wider thinking, for retrieving
scientific/technological knowledge, for analyzing problems, and for generating
solutions.&nbsp; Talking of the solution generation methods alone, TRIZ offers a
large number of techniques and principles: they include 40 Principles of
Invention, 76 Standards of Inventive Solutions, Trends of Evolution of
Technological Systems, Separation Principle, etc.&nbsp; This shows the richness and
outstanding strength in TRIZ.&nbsp; However, such a huge body of methods and
knowledge bases is not easy to understand and even confusing for learners of
TRIZ.&nbsp; Thus, unfortunately, the penetration of the Russian-born TRIZ into the
West since 1990s has been much slower than being anticipated by TRIZ enthusiasts
</font><font color="#3333ff">[6]</font><font color="#000000">.</font></font> </p>
<p><font face="Century"><font color="#000000">An approach to simplifying TRIZ
for easier industrial acceptance was started in Israel in 1980s by forming SIT
('Systematic Inventive Thinking' or 'Structured Inventive Thinking') </font>
<font color="#3333ff">[7,8]</font><font color="#000000">.&nbsp; Then in 1995, Ed
Sickafus at Ford Motor Co. adopted SIT and developed it further into USIT
('Unified Structured Inventive Thinking')&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333ff"> [9]</font><font color="#000000">.&nbsp;
USIT has been introduced and refined in Japan since 1999&nbsp; </font>
<font color="#3333ff">[10,11]</font><font color="#000000">.&nbsp;&nbsp; The present paper
intends to demonstrate that the whole TRIZ solution generation methods can be
utilized in USIT in a much simpler, unified, and effective way.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">The whole process of problem solving can
be characterized by three principal phases, i.e., Problem Definition phase,
Problem Analysis phase and Solution Generation phase, according to USIT.&nbsp; During
the first two phases we prepare in various ways only for the last phase in which
we want to make some breakthroughs to actually obtain new, innovative conceptual
ideas.&nbsp; In the present paper we focus on this final and crucial phase of
Solution Generation.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Century"><font color="#000000">In the present study,
comprehensive principles and rules in the Solution Generation methods in TRIZ
have been reclassified&nbsp; into the framework of USIT.&nbsp; As described in </font>
<font color="#3333ff">[11]</font><font color="#000000">, USIT has only five
Solution Generation Methods: they are Object Pluralization Method, Attribute
Dimensionality Method, Function Distribution Method, Solution Combination
Method, and Solution Generalization Method.&nbsp; These are based on the concept of
&quot;Objects-Attributes-Functions&quot; and have been found successful in accepting such
a large variety of individual principles/rules in TRIZ.&nbsp; Thus, without loosing
USIT's original idea of simplicity, USIT has been enhanced much into an
equivalent to the huge body of TRIZ Solution Generation methods.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">The present paper describes how the
reorganization of TRIZ was done, how the resultant Solution Generation Methods
of USIT look like, and how they can be studied and applied for creative problem
solving.</font> <br>

the Problem Analysis Stage may be selected independently (i.e, in four patterns:
A, B, A-&gt;B, and B-&gt;A).&nbsp; Five methods in the Solution Generation Stage may be

<p><font face="Century"><font color="#000000">The five methods in the Solution
Generation Stage, as described in </font><font color="#3333ff">[11]</font><font color="#000000">,
are:</font></font> <br>
&nbsp; </p>
</p><ol>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Century"><b>Object Pluralization Method:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Apply to (or operate on) every Object in the system so as to 'pluralize' it.&nbsp;
  'Plural' here (as in the English sense) means any number except 1 (i.e., 0, 2,
  3, ... inf., 1/2, 1/3, ... 1/inf., etc.)</font> </li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Century"><b>Attribute Dimensionality Method:</b>&nbsp;
  Apply to (or operate on) various Attributes of every Object in the system so
  as to modify the 'dimensionality' of the Object.&nbsp; I.e., activate/deactivate
  Attributes and vary Attributes in space and time.</font> </li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Century"><b>Function Distribution Method:</b>&nbsp;
  Apply to (or operate on) all the Fnctions in the system so as to 'distribute'
  (or rearrange) the functions among the Objects in the system (including newly
  introduced Objects).&nbsp; Also consider introducing new Functions.</font> </li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Century"><b>Solution Combination Method:</b>&nbsp;
  Apply to multiple solutions (or solution elements) and combine them in various
  ways in space, in time, in parts, etc. to form a new solution.</font> </li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Century"><b>Solution Generlaization Method:</b>&nbsp;
  Replace technical, specific terms in each solution with plain, generic terms.</font>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">The first three methods operate on
Objects, Attributes, and Functions, respectively.&nbsp; In the preceeding stage of
Problem Analysis, the problem solver should have fully analysed the system of
the problem with the concept of 'Objects-Attributes-Functions'; this makes the
application of these three methods smooth.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Century"><font color="#000000">Some historical comments may be
necessary on the fourth method especially for readers of the USIT textbook</font><font color="#3333ff">
[9]</font><font color="#000000">:&nbsp;&nbsp; The 'Transduction' method by Sickafus has
been resolved here into the Function Distribution Method (in the sense of
energy-converting function) and the Solution Combination Method (in the sense of
linking two functions). The 'Uniqueness' method by Sickafus has been moved
mainly to the 'Space and Time Characteristic Analyis' method in the Problem
Analysis Stage, and partially to the first four Solution Generation Methods
listed above (in the sense of space- and time-characteristic solutions).&nbsp; The
current fourth method, i.e. Solution Combination Method, was introduced in
</font><font color="#3333ff">[11] </font><font color="#000000">so as to cover a
wide range of solution techniques, which correspond to the ones supported by
TRIZ Separation Principle.</font></font> </p>
<p><font face="Century"><font color="#000000">The fifth method, Solution
Generalization Method, intends to break Psychological Inertia, especially the
one due to technical terms, and to systematize the solution search.&nbsp; The chapter
'Generification - A USIT Process' in Sickafus' textbook</font><font color="#3333ff">
[9]</font><font color="#000000"> is worth reading.</font></font> <br>

<p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Century">2.2 TRIZ Methods for the Solution
Generation Phase</font></b> </p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">Since TRIZ is such a huge collection of
findings, techniques, knowledge bases, examples, etc. for various phases/aspects
of problem solving, we need some preliminary discussion on which we should
include here as TRIZ methods for the Solution Generation phase.</font> </p>

by Darrell Mann </font><font color="#3333ff">[5]</font><font color="#000000">

<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">In the sense of USIT, the Phase (III)
should be divided into Problem Analysis and Solution Generation phases.&nbsp; We
classified the tools in Phase (III) into the following four groups:</font> </p>
</p><ul>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Century">Tools for Problem Analysis phase:&nbsp;
  Technical Contradiction (i.e., Contradiction Matrix), (formulation of)
  Physical Contradiction, S-Field Analysis, Psychological Inertia Tools
  (including Smart Little People), and Subversion Analysis</font> </li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Century">Main tools for Solution Generation
  phase:&nbsp; Inventive Principles, Separation Principle (for solving Physical
  Contradiction), Inventive Standards, Trends of Technological Evolution (as the
  guiding principles), Trimming, and Ideal Final Result (as a guiding principle)</font>
  </li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Century">Supporting knowledge tools for
  Solution Generation phase:&nbsp; Resources and Knowledge/ Effects</font> </li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Century">Overall composite procedure (to be
  compared with USIT itself): ARIZ</font> </li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">Thus there are three most important
methods (or collections of methods) we want to examine in the present work:&nbsp;
they are Inventive Principles, Inventive Standards, and Trends of Technological
Evolution.&nbsp; Three other methods (i.e., Separation Principle, Trimming, and Ideal
Final Result) are rather standing alone and may be handled later individually.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">Resources and Knowledge/Effects are not
procedures in nature but rather knowledge which should be used to support the
solution generation.&nbsp; Thus they may be set aside in the present mapping work.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Century"><font color="#000000">Since USIT is proposed as an
overall procedure for problem solving, it replaces ARIZ, and other similar
overall procedures such as the ones recommended by Salamatov </font>

Solution Generation Methods</font></b> </p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">Following sources are used for the three
main TRIZ Solution Generation methods:</font> </p>

  along with the second-level names, where the digits behind a dot stand for the

  citation for the third level.</font></font> </li>
  <li><font face="Century"><font color="#000000">[T] <b>Trends of Evolution of

  </li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">The terminology in Inventive Principles
and in Trends of Evolution are mostly understandable even for TRIZ beginners.&nbsp;
One should note that the statements of Trends should be regarded not only as the
observation but also as the guiding principle in our context.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">Inventive Standards, on the other hand,
are based on the S-Field Analysis formulation of the problem and use a
terminology particular to TRIZ.&nbsp; Thus brief explanation may be appropriate:</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">In the S-Field Model (or SFM), the
system of problem must be focused sharply by the representation with only two
'Substances' (S1 and S2) and one 'Field' (F).&nbsp; 'Substance' here is a generic
term for representing 'something' and is essentially the same as 'Object' in
USIT.&nbsp; 'Field' in TRIZ is a generic term particular to TRIZ for representing
interactions, forces, energy, physical fields, functions, etc.&nbsp; In a
well-defined system, the Substance S2 works as a tool by applying the
interaction F onto the target Substance S1.&nbsp; The term 'Environment' stands for
all other system components than S1 and S2 and also for anything existing or
easily-accessible around the system.&nbsp;&nbsp; In various cases of problem system,
either one of the three elements is
missing/inappropriate/insufficient/exceeding/harmful/etc.&nbsp; Inventive Standards
specify the cases and state relevant solution guidelines as suggestions.</font>

<p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Century">2.4 Heuristics Listed by Sickafus</font></b>
</p>
<p><font face="Century"><font color="#000000">In the USIT textbook </font>
<font color="#3333ff">[9]</font><font color="#000000">, Sickafus listed 21
Heuristics in addition to detailed description of USIT Solution Generation
Methods.&nbsp; They seem to reflect Sickafus' efforts for trying to merge TRIZ
methods with his original ones in the style similar to Inventive Principles.&nbsp;
Since they contain several unique viewpoints, we have decided to classify them
also in the present framework.</font></font> </p>
<p><font face="Century"><font color="#000000">Sickafus' Heuristics and their
subcategories are numbered as they appear in</font><font color="#3333ff"> [9]</font><font color="#000000">,
and are cited here as [H5a], [H5abc], etc.&nbsp; These Heuristics have emphasis on
the viewpoints (e.g., 'Rate of events', 'Periodicity', etc.) and hence both
positive and negative actions (e.g., introduce/remove, increase/decrease, etc.)
are listed in their subcategories.&nbsp; Even though such reverse thinking is
important to break Psychological Inertia, we think that our guidelines should
show some most appropriate directions (just like in the statements of Trends of
Evolution) while keeping the reverse thinking as a reminder applicable in
general context.</font></font> <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Century">2.5 Mapping, Regrouping, and
Describing Processes</font></b> </p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">The three sources of TRIZ methods (i.e.,
Inventive Principles [P], Inventive Standards [S], and Trends of Evolution of
Technological Systems [T]) and Sickafus' list of Heuristics [H] are handled at
their lowest-level submethods such as [P1a], [S1-1.8.1], [T1], [H1a], etc.&nbsp; Each
submethod is examined in its implication and mapped onto the USIT's five
Solution Generation Methods.&nbsp; It should be noted that the mapping allows 1 to n
and hence a TRIZ submethod can be mapped onto multiple places in the USIT
methods.&nbsp; For instance, [P3c] of Local Quality Principle is mapped onto the
Object, Function, and Combination methods, while [P3d] onto Attribute and
Combination methods.&nbsp; In this manner, all the submethods of the four sources
have individually found their appropriate candidate positions in the USIT
framework.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Century"><font color="#000000">Then all these (TRIZ-origin)
submethods are regrouped in a hierarchical manner in the framework of USIT.&nbsp;
Each of the five USIT Solution Generation Methods originally had a few
submethods and brief guidelines </font><font color="#3333ff">[11]</font><font color="#000000">.&nbsp;
The present work has urged to introduce a few more submethods and has much
enhanced the contents in the form of lower-level submethods and their
descriptions.&nbsp; To each USIT submethod, we have found contributions of sometimes
all the four sources together, sometimes three, two, and one of them, and in
some special cases none of them (that means being original in USIT).</font></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">Next (or , in actual, repeatedly in
parallel to the regrouping work), we have described the guidelines of the USIT
methods in a hierarchical manner so as to cover the intentions of the regrouped
TRIZ-origin submethods.&nbsp; Even though the principles/techniques in TRIZ are
stated in quite different levels of abstraction, we have tried to maintain the
level of abstruction most suggestive as the hints for solution generation.&nbsp; It
is important that the USIT submethod should not be restricted in its implication
to the extents of the TRIZ-origin submethods mapped there.&nbsp; We should rather
regard the latters as non-comprehensive examples of guidelines of the USIT
submethods.</font> <br>

<p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Century">3.2 Merging TRIZ Minor Methods into
USIT</font></b> </p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">In relation to the previous discussion
in Section 2.2, we should comment here on how we handle several minor methods in
TRIZ:</font> <br>
&nbsp; </p>
</p><ul>
  <li><font face="Century"><font color="#000000"><b>TRIZ Separation Principle:</b>&nbsp;
  This principle corresponds to the USIT method (4), i.e. Solution Combination
  Method.&nbsp; Separation Principle guides you to find some situation where the
  opposite simultaneous requirements in the Physical Contradiction can be
  separated, then to find partial solutions to fulfill the requirements
  separately, and finally to combine the partial solutions in a compatible way.&nbsp;
  Exactly for this third step, USIT Solution Combination Method gives you full
  guidelines.&nbsp; USIT way is much easier to understand and to apply.&nbsp; (Karasik
  </font><font color="#3333ff">[13]</font><font color="#000000"> wrote on the
  history of Separation Principle and that the idea of separation in various
  dual views (other than time and space) was difficult to understand even for
  Altshuller.)</font></font> </li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Century"><b>Trimming:&nbsp;</b> This corresponds to
  the USIT submethod (1a), i.e., 'Eliminate the Object'.</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Century"><font color="#000000"><b>Ideal Final Result: </b>The
  'Self-X' solution guidelines as described by Mann </font>
  <font color="#3333ff">[14]</font><font color="#000000"> is the main tool in
  this category for the Solution Generation phase.&nbsp; The guidelines should have
  their location in the USIT submethod (3h) ('Introduce/enhance the
  adapting/coordination/control Function'), together with the TRIZ [P25]
  ('Self-service').</font></font> </li>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">The left-most part of Fig. 2 shows the
basic system representation in USIT.&nbsp; The upper Object (most important in the
system and hence shown at the top with an oval) receives a Function (as shown
with an arrow) from the lower Object (shown with a rectangle).&nbsp; Objects are
shown either with ovals (representing the Target Objects) or usually with
rectangles (sometimes called the Tool Objects in TRIZ).&nbsp; Attributes of Objects
are represented with colors and patterns in the Object symbols.&nbsp; In the middle
part of Fig. 2, you would recognize some patterns for solid, powder, liquid,
gas, hazardous Attribute, space-varying Attribute, and micro-level Attribute.&nbsp;
Nature of Functions is represented by styles of arrows.&nbsp; In Fig. 2, you see
arrows standing for a useful Function, a (useful but) insufficient Function, an
excessive (hence rather harmful) Function, a harmful Function, and three more
Functions with different patterns (for showing their differences).&nbsp; The
illustrations in Appendix are designed to stimulate abstract thinking in the
�Objects-Attributes-Functions� scheme.&nbsp; Note that they try to suggest the
solution generation scheme of each submethod correctly but do not cover the full
range of each submethod.</font> <br>

<p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Century">3.4 How to Use the Table of USIT
Solution Generation Methods</font></b> </p>
<p><font face="Century"><font color="#000000">The most important usage of the
Table of USIT Solution Generation Methods is to study TRIZ in its full aspect of
Solution Generation phase.&nbsp; Many TRIZ methods, which are taught in different
dedicated chapters in traditional textbooks, can be studied here in a unified
way.&nbsp; For the students/practitioners of TRIZ, the fully expanded version </font>
<font color="#3333ff">[14]</font><font color="#000000"> containing the
descriptions of TRIZ submethods would be most instructive and self-learnable.</font></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">For the beginners of USIT, the brief
guidelines down to the submethod level (e.g., (1a), (1b), etc.) may be enough.&nbsp;
Various simple examples and illustrations should be added for easier
understanding.&nbsp; Representative schemes of operations of submethods are shown in
simple illustrations in the Appendix for this purpose.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">To serious USIT students, the full table
shown in the Appendix should be presented and explained.&nbsp; A number of examples
should be shown to them with the help of examples already accumulated in TRIZ.&nbsp;
Studying TRIZ itself should be encouraged, even though not mandatory for them to
understand and apply USIT successfully.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">During the USIT sessions for solving
real problems, the outline table (i.e., Table 1) may be useful as a brief
reference.&nbsp; In the spirit of USIT, we should better use the knowledge in our own
brain.&nbsp; Once USIT students learn the full table, they may be able to use the
outline table as a reminder without depending on it too much.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">The USIT procedure shown in Fig. 1 can
be applied without change.&nbsp; Problem solving with USIT must have become much more
powerful than before.&nbsp; Applying various submethods to the Objects, Attributes,
Functions, and preliminary Solutions would give multiple (rather a large number
of) conceptual solutions.&nbsp; It is not necessary of course to make exhaustive
trials of the submethod operations onto the elements in the system.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Century"><font color="#000000">We have been proposing to use USIT
and TRIZ software tools in a complementary way </font><font color="#3333ff">[11]</font><font color="#000000">.&nbsp;
Use USIT as the leading process of the problem solving and as the guidelines for
human thinking, especially in a group work in industrial problem solving.&nbsp; Use
TRIZ software tools basically as a knowledge-base for supplementing
scientific/technological knowledge, good examples of applying principles, and
checklists of properties/functions, etc.&nbsp; In our table of USIT Solution
Generation Methods, you may find several points where supplements from
knowledge-base tools would be effective.&nbsp; We think it not effective to make
software tools guide our thinking process and to use software tools as the main
tool in a group-work session.</font></font> <br>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">The full range of TRIZ methods for
Solution Generation phase, including Inventive Principles, Inventive Standards,
Trends of Evolution, Separation Principle, Trimming, and Self-X principle, have
been reorganized in the framework of USIT and unified smoothly into USIT's five
Solution Generation Methods.&nbsp; These Solution Generation Methods can be utilized
in a compact scheme of USIT process as shown in the flowchart in Fig. 1.&nbsp; The
USIT process is easier to learn and apply than ARIZ and many other overall
procedures proposed in the framework of TRIZ.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">The reorganization and unification of
TRIZ methods has made them much simpler to apply to problem solving.&nbsp; Inventive
Principles, Inventive Standards, and Trends of Evolution, for instance, can be
used simultaneously in an enhanced way.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">The prerequisites for using the present
USIT Solution Generation Methods may be the understanding of relevant Objects,
Attributes, and Functions in the system and of Space and Time characteristics of
the system.&nbsp; Such prerequisites should be prepared earlier in the Problem
Definition and Problem Analysis phases.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">Let us now consider how such
prerequisites could be obtained.&nbsp; In case of traditional TRIZ, each Solution
Generation method has its own specific Problem Analysis tool: they are
Contradiction Matrix for Inventive Principles, S-Field Analysis for Inventive
Standards, and ARIZ for Separation Principle.&nbsp; The separation of these pair-wise
tools has been making the analysis (i.e. obtaining the prerequisites) in each
method insufficient in its scope.&nbsp; Hence, the solution generation becomes
difficult and tricky, and the whole process of TRIZ is difficult to learn.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">Thus, the unification of TRIZ Solution
Generation methods in the present study urges, as the next step, the
unification/simplification of TRIZ in the Problem Analysis phase.&nbsp; The present
authors understand that USIT has already provided a good proposal for that
purpose, too.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">As shown in Fig. 1, USIT has clear
processes of Problem Definition Stage and Problem Analysis Stage.&nbsp; The Closed
World Method urges the problem solvers to find the
'Objects-Attributes-Functions' relationships in the problem system, and the
Space and Time Characteristics Analysis makes them aware of the characteristic
nature of the problem system in space and in time.&nbsp; Particles Method further
makes the images of the ideal solution and how to approach to it.&nbsp; Thus USIT
prepares the above mentioned prerequisites of solution generation in a smooth
and consistent way.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">The present table of USIT Solution
Generation Methods has not been shown yet to USIT students.&nbsp; We should be
careful to show it in a way as simple and understandable as possible.&nbsp; Once in
an early stage of the present work, we made a matrix presentation of the mapping
from the Inventive Principles onto the USIT methods.&nbsp; When we showed it to
engineers at our USIT practice session, the engineers found it too much for
using in practice.&nbsp; This experience gives us a warning against providing too
extensive set of tools.&nbsp; Thus we are currently planning to show and use the
present information in a step-wise manner as described in Section 3.4.</font>

<p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Century"><font size="+1">5. CONCLUSION</font></font></b>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Century">The huge body of TRIZ Solution
Generation methods, including Inventive Principles, Inventive Standards, Trends
of Evolution, Separation Principle, etc., has been reorganized in the present
study into simple five Solution Generation Methods in USIT.&nbsp; The latter is shown
in the table in Appendix which contains brief and plain guidelines for
application.&nbsp; Since the whole procedure of USIT is simple and easy to apply, the
present work provides a practical basis for learning and applying the essence of
TRIZ in real problem solving in industrial situations.</font> <br>
