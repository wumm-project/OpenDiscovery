<p>Introduction:</b> &quot;TIPS&quot; is the acronym for &quot;Theory of Inventive Problem
Solving,&quot; and &quot;TRIZ&quot; is the acronym for the same phrase in Russian. TRIZ
was developed by Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues (Ref. 1,2,3,4) in the former USSR
starting in 1946, and is now being developed and practiced throughout the world. (Ref.5).</p>

<p>TRIZ research began with the hypothesis that there are universal principles of
invention that are the basis for creative innovations that advance technology, and that if
these principles could be identified and codified, they could be taught to people to make
the process of invention more predictable. The research has proceeded in several stages
over the last 50 years. Over 2 million patents have been examined, classified by level of
inventiveness, and analyzed to look for principles of innovation. The three primary
findings of this research are as follows:

</p><ol>
  <li><b>Problems and solutions were repeated across industries and sciences </b></li>
  <li><b>Patterns of technical evolution were repeated across industries and sciences</b></li>
  <li><b>Innovations used scientific effects outside the field where they were developed </b></li>
</ol>

<p>Much of the practice of TRIZ consists of learning these repeating patterns of
problems-solutions and patterns of technical evolution, and methods of using scientific
effects, and applying the general TRIZ patterns to the specific situation that confronts
the inventor.. Figure 1 describes this process.</p>

<p>Early research indicates that inventors using TRIZ experience improvement of 70% to
300% or more in the number of creative ideas that they generate for solving technical
problems and in the speed with which they generate innovative ideas. (Ref. 6). When TRIZ
was first introduced to practitioners of Quality Function Deployment, the appeal was
immediate. (Ref. 7,8 US introduction, Ref. 9,10 Japanese introduction)</p>

<p>QFD has been winning proponents because of the clarity with which it identifies
customers&#146; needs, organizational technological capabilities, design properties,
reliability problems, functional capabilities, and the relationships between all these
factors. Many QFD users found themselves overwhelmed with the richness of these data: once
they knew the relationships between the customers&#146; needs and their own abilities to
satisfy those needs, they wanted further help to create the innovative product and service
designs that would meet or exceed the customers&#146; needs. TRIZ is the family of tools
that gives QFD practioners the help they need to innovate to satisfy their customers.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>QFD and TRIZ</b>:<b> </b></p>

<p>Each of the major tools of TRIZ can be used in a variety of stages of Quality Function
Deployment. For simplicity, the tools of TRIZ will be explained briefly, and a correlation
matrix will be proposed to identify the opportunities to use TRIZ to enhance QFD.</p>

<p>There are many ways to organize the tools and techniques of TRIZ. A flow chart is
useful when introducing TRIZ, since it shows how the tools are related, as well as what
they are. Figure 2 is a typical flow chart used for either a product design or process
development problem. </p>

<p>The first stage is analysis. Tools shown on the flow chart are

</p><ul>
  </p><ul>
    <i><b>
    <li>Functional Analysis</b></i>&#151;familiar to QFD users. Analyze the system, subsystems,
      and components in terms of the functions performed (not the technologies used.) One new
      technique in TRIZ is &quot;trimming&quot;&#151;examining each function to see if it is
      necessary, and, if it is, whether any other element of the system could perform the
      function. Breakthrough designs and reductions in cost and complexity are frequent results
      of functional analysis and trimming.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

</p><ul>
  </p><ul>
    <i><b>
    <li>The Ideal Final Result</b></i>&#151;familiar to QFD users as the customers&#146;
      demanded quality. Express the situation in terms of why the innovation is needed, using
      technology-independent and implementation-independent language. Strategic breakthroughs
      frequently come from the insight gained at this step. Quality improvement opportunities
      can be identified finding what elements make the system non-ideal. The progress that a
      design makes from a starting point toward the ideal final result is called
      &quot;ideality&quot; and is defined using the value equation as </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Ideality <font SIZE="4">= </font><font FACE="Symbol">S</font> Benefits / ( <font FACE="Symbol">S </font>Costs + <font FACE="Symbol">S </font>Harm)</p>
          <i><b>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

</p><ul>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Resource Analysis</b></i>. Identification of the available things, energy sources,
      information, functions, and other elements that are in or near the system, that could be
      combined with the elements of the system to improve it. QFD practioners will find that an
      awareness of the uses of resources in TRIZ changes the way that they conduct customer
      observation visits (Ref. 2.)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

</p><ul>
  </p><ul>
    <i><b>
    <li>Locating the Zone of Conflict</b></i>&#151;familiar to quality improvement researchers
      as &quot;root cause analysis.&quot; Understanding the exact cause of the problem. The
      &quot;zone&quot; refers to the time and place that the problem occurs. A new tool,
      anticipatory failure determination (Ref. 12) introduced by Kaplan, Zusman, and Zlotin,
      reverses the process, and guides the researcher to look for ways to cause failures, to
      increase understanding of how to prevent the failures.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>If the problem has been solved in the analysis phase, developers frequently proceed to
implementation. If it has not been solved, or if alternate solutions are desired for
maximum creativity, the data-based tools, Principles, Prediction, and Effects, are used.
In many TRIZ applications, all three of the data-based tools of TRIZ are used. The flow
chart shows a decision (diamond symbol <font FACE="Symbol">à</font> ) indicating the
choice of tools.

</p><ul>
  </p><ul>
    <b><i>
    <li>Principles (also called resolution of contradictions) </i>Technical contradictions</b>
      are the classical engineering &quot;trade-offs.&quot; The desired state can&#146;t be
      reached because something else in the system prevents it. <b>Physical Contradictions are
      situations where </b>one object has contradictory, opposite requirements. TRIZ guides the
      developer to design principles that resolve the contradiction, once the contradiction is
      defined in terms of standard parameters. See Appendix 1 for examples and Ref. 13 for the
      complete data base, with examples.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

</p><ul>
  </p><ul>
    <i><b>
    <li>Prediction (also called Technology Forecasting.)</b></i>: TRIZ identifies 8 patterns of
      technical evolution. Designs of systems, subsystems or components can be deliberately
      moved to the next higher stage within a particular pattern, once the pattern is
      identified. The 8 patterns are </li>
  </ul>

        </ol>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

</p><ul>
  </p><ul>
    <i><b>
    <li>Effects: </b></i>Use scientific and engineering phenomenology and effects outside the
      discipline in which they were developed. Tools include data bases, science encyclopedias,
      and searches of the technical literature to find alternate ways to achieve the functions
      that are needed to solve the problem. Classical examples include the use of geometrical
      solutions to mechanical problems (use of a Moebius strip doubles the lifetime of a belt)
      and use of biological solutions to chemical problems (tailored bacteria that
      &quot;eat&quot; contaminants, instead of complex filters) as well as use of common science
      from one area that is unknown in others (Carbon-14 dating was well-known in chemistry for
      30 years before archeologists learned about it.)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>The last block in the flow chart is Evaluation of Solutions. Solutions are compared to
the Ideal Final Result, to be sure that the improvements do advance the technology and
meet the customers&#146; needs. Multiple solutions may be combined to improve the overall
solution using a Feature Transfer (Ref. 14) which is similar to Pugh concept selection and
improvement (Ref. 15.)</p>

<p>The flow chart shows that remaining problems are resolved by iterating the process. The
advantage of TRIZ is that the iterations are very fast, and a great number of innovative
ideas are developed at each stage.</p>

<p>The general problem solving process of TRIZ can be used whenever the product or process
developer has inventive problems. Specific tools that may be useful by themselves during
Quality Function Deployment are listed in Figure 3, and the stages of QFD in which they
are useful are indicated.</p>
