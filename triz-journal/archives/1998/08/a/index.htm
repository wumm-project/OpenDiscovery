<p>The research that developed the TRIZ method (Altshuller, 1988) focused on studying the
patterns of change that created innovative patents. Applying the heuristic rules that the
TRIZ research uncovered, such as the patterns of technological evolution and the 40
principles of innovative problem solving has led us to new heights of creativity. Applying
the problem analysis methods, such as ARIZ, Su-field analysis, and more recent techniques
(functional analysis, problem formulator techniques, triads, etc.) expand the creative
possibilities still more.</p>

<p>TRIZ has given us a left-brain methodology for breakthrough product innovation, a model
for the product developers or problem solvers to use to organize and analyze their
collective thoughts. Left-brain methods rely on logic and data. Brainstorming methods that
rely on mood and making unexpected connections use right-brain thinking. (Ornstein, 1975.)
The power of TRIZ comes from the logical analysis and recognition of patterns in our
current problems, and application of the solutions that has developed breakthroughs for
that pattern. One of the problems in the application of TRIZ, however, has been the
phenomenon that Altshuller identified as &quot;Psychological Inertia.&quot; (See the other
articles in the August, 1998 issue of The TRIZ Journal.) TRIZ itself helps overcome the
Psychological Inertia of many developers, but it can sometimes prevent them from using the
creative ideas that they generate by applying the TRIZ methods.</p>

<p>The same logic that developed TRIZ, the study of patterns of invention, has been
applied in other disciplines. Studying the patterns in other aspects of life, like the way
we think, has lead to fascinating breakthroughs in the study of cognitive strategies.</p>

<p>A cognitive strategy refers to the mental process or program (in the sense of a
computer program) that creates a specific outcome. Each step in a cognitive strategy is
characterized by the use of one or more of the five senses; sight, hearing, feeling,
tasting, or smelling. In order to replicate a cognitive strategy, you need to recognize
it, attach some meaning to it, and analyze the information around other strategies. </p>

<p>Researchers have found ways to model excellence by teaching people the cognitive
strategies of others. This methodology is called Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP).
(Bandler &amp; Grinder, 1979.) Robert Dilts, a co-founder, avid researcher, and author in
the field of NLP, has studied and modeled the cognitive strategies of geniuses and then
created models of how they thought. The cognitive strategies of geniuses like Fritz Perls,
Milton Erickson, Mozart, Einstein, and Walt Disney have all been studied to determine
their unique cognitive strategy. Using NLP techniques in product design session can help
engineers enter into states of excellence where they will overcome their own psychological
inertia, and be able to take advantage of the creativity and innovation of TRIZ more
naturally and easily. </p>

<p>For example, one NLP technique called, &quot;anchoring,&quot; uses language and sensory
imagery to lead product development team members into a time when they were wonderfully
creative and innovative. By asking team members to use sensory language (what they saw,
heard, or felt) to describe the environment, attitudes, skills, and beliefs they
experienced during a period of intense creativity, their neurology starts a the process of
recreating their own cognitive strategy for personal excellence.</p>

<p>Thus, if their application of TRIZ creates radical, new, breakthrough ideas, they are
less likely to reject them (&quot;we've never done it that way&quot;) because their work
with NLP has conditioned them to accept the new ideas. </p>

<p>By combining the potential of NLP with a power of TRIZ/ARIZ, and addressing creativity
from a cognitive standpoint and a logical one, organizations can realize tremendous
product breakthroughs. </p>
