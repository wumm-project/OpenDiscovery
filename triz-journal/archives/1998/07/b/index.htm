<p>Twenty-one people attended the meeting June 13, 1998, in Novi, MI, USA to form the
Altshuller Institute. Lev Shulyak, who had served as the chairman of the organizing
committee conveyed greetings from Mr. Altshuller and his wishes for the success of the new
organization.</p>

<p>The following were elected:</p>

<blockquote>
  <div align="left"><table border="0" cellpadding="7">
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" align="left">President:</td>
      <td valign="top" align="left">Lev Shulyak</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" align="left">Vice President:</td>
      <td valign="top" align="left">Larry Smith</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" align="left">Secretary:</td>
      <td valign="top" align="left">John Terninko</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" align="left">Treasurer:</td>
      <td valign="top" align="left">Zinovy Royzen</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>There was general agreement that the new organization will provide an &quot;open
place&quot; for TRIZ, for discussion of where it will go, how it will develop, how best to
use what is here. &quot;Open place&quot; was discussed, and the assembly agreed that it
would be a safe environment, where people with different views of the practice of TRIZ and
different technologies, and different experiences could learn together, without criticism,
and without seeking commercial advantage. The Altshuller Institute will specifically seek
to cultivate Mr. Altshuller&#146;s philosophy of sharing knowledge and helping others
learn. The officers, and the committees that they will form, will turn these general
sentiments into a mission statement and organizational by-laws in the coming months.</p>

<p>The Altshuller Institute tentatively scheduled a conference in Detroit, MI, USA, in
March, 1999. This will combine a technical conference with a membership meeting. The TRIZ
Institute is donating publicity for this conference, and other supporters are asked to
help publicize the conference by use of their web sites, mailing lists, etc.</p>
