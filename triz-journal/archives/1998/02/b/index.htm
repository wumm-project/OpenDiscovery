<p>(Editor's note: Ms. Atkins conducted this interview while stationed in St. Petersburg.
She speaks, reads and translates Russian fluently. Ms. Zakharov and her husband are now
living in the United States. In Part 2 of this article, scheduled for a future issue of
the TRIZ Journal, Ms. Atkins interviews James Kowalick, who has been teaching these same
creativity techniques to grade school and high school students in a small private school
located in the Sierra Mountain foothills of northern California. An article by Dr.
Kowalick also appears in this month's issue of the TRIZ Journal.)</p>

<p>PART 1</i></p>

<p><b>Zakarov</b> Welcome to our school. Private schools are still a rarity in Russia, and
their relationships with the state are primitive and unsystematized.</p>

<p><b>Atkins</b> We also have a private school that is new <i>(in the Sierras of northern
California)</i>. We are developing new methods, where TRIZ is being taught to teenagers.
It would be interesting to know how TRIZ is being taught here, to younger children.</p>

<p><b>Zakarov</b> There is a book by Shustermann - <i>Adventures of a Loaf</i>. In this
book, on the basis of a fairy tale, he acquaints children with the basic fundamentals of
TRIZ. This is the way we begin too. We have a preparatory <i>(pre-school)</i> department,
where we train children before school, using this book, and other fairy tales.</p>

<p>We have a very detailed outline of the school's curriculum, and I have developed the
first year's program in TRIZ, at different levels.</p>

<p><b>Director</b> Our educational program has three stages: developmental, basic and
aesthetic. &quot;Developmental&quot; is general for all subjects and includes, besides
TRIZ, mnemotechnics - the development of different kinds of memory; development of
creative imagination; and the development of intellectual potential - which includes the
development of attention, spatial conceptualization, and logical thinking. These <i>(developmental,
basic and aesthetic)</i> are the three main constituents in the preparatory cycle.</p>

<p><b>Atkins</b> Do you have a methodology for the course?</p>

<p><b>Director</b> Each of our teachers has his own course, and we share information. But
next year we are planning to publish teaching manuals and course materials for our school.
Such documentation doesn't exist anywhere else.</p>

<p><b>Zakarov</b> I would like to make contact with American schools using TRIZ methods.<i></p>

<p><b>Atkins</b> There are really very few schools using TRIZ - even if universities are
counted. We have in fact only one teacher in the United States, who is working with junior
and senior high school students in a small private school. Other than him, there are a
couple teaching TRIZ in universities.</p>

<p><b>Director</b> The TRIZ system as taught by Tatiana is unique. In other schools, TRIZ
is taught simply like an educational game. They treat TRIZ like a crossword puzzle, and
they treat solutions just like the solutions to a crossword puzzle. And then, of course,
those associated with these other schools ask, &quot;What is this 'TRIZ'??&quot; and
&quot;Who needs TRIZ?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Zakarov</b> I have worked out a program for small children in great detail, with
explanatory notes. If you're interested, I can give a seminar. Moreover, this methodology
can be used for teaching specific subjects. I'm now teaching fourth grade history. I'm not
a historian - I'm merely like any other educated person. This is my textbook on history
(she unfolds a schematic diagram). </p>

<p><b>Zakarov</b> (pointing) This is a systematic operator. We consider the
&quot;state&quot; as system, and we look at (historical) changes in the state as changes
in a system. We examine the connections between these changes. In general, any system
consists of parts - elements or &quot;sub-systems&quot; - and any system is itself a part
of the system that is one level above, which we call a &quot;super-system.&quot;</p>

<p>(She picks up and illustrates a pen and its parts.)</p>

<p><b>Atkins</b> So if the pen is the system, then you are the super-system?</p>

<p><b>Zakarov</b> No, each system has several super-systems. The super-system for the pen
includes chalk, pencils, other pens - everything which makes a mark.</p>

<p>By the way, our school is housed in the Palace of Culture (in St. Petersburg), where
many other artistic activities take place in the evenings and after school. These include
music, theatre, dance and painting. The children seem to like the fact that it seems less
formal here, for that reason.</p>

<p>(We went into a classroom where about a dozen children were sitting at desks in pairs).</p>

<p><b>Zakarov</b> Today we will be using the numbers axis principle of TRIZ, to create
stories. Imagine that an object can be changed in any direction, in any quantity. Take
hair for example. Imagine that it can grow infinitely. How will you comb your hair, over
what balcony? And who will hold the brush when you can't reach any farther? Or, imagine
what would happen if your hair grew inward. Or, through your ears?</p>

<p>Or take, as a subject, memory. What is memory? It is the ability to store information.
And what is, for example, the inverse of information? The ability to store information
about the future - or perhaps storing misinformation.</p>

<p>In one story, for instance, part of a man's memory was separated from him, hidden in
the form of crystals, and buried. Where it was buried a house was built, and all the
inhabitants began to have similar dreams - about war. Then it became apparent that it was
somebody's memory that had been buried there. These are the kinds of stories that our
children are able to create with the methods we use in this school. It is simply one
exercise - where we imagine many plots for science fiction. Mr. Simon Litvin observed that
so many plots (i.e., using our creativity system) are not conceivable in all of science
fiction.</p>

<p><b>Zakarov</b> Going back to the numbers axis, it contains the following eight
techniques:<br>
Increasing and decreasing the quantities of something (objects, dimensions, etc.)

</p><ol>
  </i>
  <li>Speeding up and slowing down times and durations.</li>
  <li>Animating and in-animating objects.</li>
  <li>Universalizing and delimiting.</li>
  <li>Inverting.</li>
  <li>Splitting up and unifying.</li>
  <li>Quantifiability and continuity.</li>
  <li>Shifting in time.</li>
</ol>
<i>

<p>(For the first hour, the class proceeded to put the story of Little Red Riding Hood
through the eight methods. They increased the numbers of children, so that the wolf got
sick and developed an allergy to eating people. They decreased Little Red Riding Hood's
size, so that the wolf couldn't notice her at all. Then they slowed down her pace ad
infinitum so that the wolf waited in vain. Then they changed her pace to that of a bullet
flying past his ear.</p>

<p>Then they decided to take on another tale, &quot;The Tale of the Billy Goat's
Gruff,&quot; and they ran it through the eight methods in a like manner. They did the same
with &quot;Cinderella,&quot; &quot;The Round Loaf,&quot; and other tales.</p>

<p>The second hour was dedicated to a study of the principle of the system operator (see
above discussion), in the context of Russian and USA history. Various historical,
political and economic contradictions were examined from the point of view of their causes
and resolutions, and their influences on sub-systems and super-systems.)</p>
</i>

<p><i><b>Zakarov</b> The &quot;system&quot; of the democratic state (e.g., the USA) begins
to form by piecing together certain elements (sub-systems) to create this new system. The
system is also described by the relations between these elements. But the social and
economic relations in the country (USA) did not correspond to the conditions that formed
the new nation, because they (the social and economic relations) were based upon slavery.
What was to be done? Any system tends towards self-preservation, and a conflict arose. One
&quot;element&quot; conflicted with another, and they strove to eliminate each other. The
&quot;sub-system&quot; of the North turned out to be the stronger.</i></p>

<p><i><b>Atkins</b> But there are cases where former elements return to the system later,
like the King and Queen of England.</i></p>

<p><i><b>Zakarov</b> Yes, but they returned on another level, lower this time. The system
operator can be applied in chemistry, in biology, and even in music. For instance, in
music, which is a system, all the elements can be changed.</i></p>

<p><i><b>Atkins</b>. This is very interesting.</i></p>

<p><i><b>Zakarov</b> Besides developing thinking, this method develops creative
imagination. As examples, we consider the system &quot;planet.&quot; Its smallest elements
are atoms, for which the class substituted live cells. Then the planets became
&quot;alive,&quot; and an entirely new solar system was created. There were men planets,
children planets and women planets with different characteristics - some were very chic,
others were pessimists, and still others were misers, etc. This alone is enough material
for composing an entire story.</i></p>

<p><i>On the other hand, if you simply ask someone to &quot;invent&quot; a new solar
system, he would not know where or how to begin. But here, we used a system operator and
there you have it - a new solar system. And by the way, there was a small planet that
escaped from her system . . . one that, like a runaway child, didn't like his home . . .</i></p>

<p><i><b>Atkins</b> System operators have behind them powerful creative potential. What is
being done in California is somewhat similar to what you are doing. That instructor (Dr.
James Kowalick) has developed course materials for teaching teachers who instruct gifted
and talented students. However, I had never sat through an entire class there, so this
experience is all very illuminating.</i></p>

<p><i><b>Zakarov</b> Yes, as you say, TRIZ is very powerful. Did you notice that, after
today's class was over, the children were so excited that they wanted to stay and talk
about what they invented? They were also conversing about how stupid it is that the bell
had to ring so soon - which is, of course, a very pleasant sound to some teachers.</i></p>

<p><i>But even adults sitting in on these classes are fascinated. I also give TRIZ classes
to students in the university, studying to become teachers. We also use the TRIZ-based
system operator there. I explain to them how to apply it to different subjects.</i></p>

<p><i>But it is more difficult to teach this to degreed, experienced teachers. Their
thinking habits are hard to change. For example, they have developed the habit of (only)
delivering information, and they don't know how to effectively apply the information in
the classroom to promote real learning. I myself have only been using the system operator
- as applied to the subject of history - for two years. Prior to that, I had been applying
it to Russian language and to mathematics.</i></p>

<p><i>By the way, a &quot;word&quot; is also a system which comprises different elements.
A word is also an element of some larger system (super-system).</i></p>

<p><i><b>Atkins</b> When you studied in Vyborg University, did they teach this material
there?</i></p>

<p><i><b>Zakarov</b> No, they taught only the basic principles of TRIZ. In general, adults
are difficult to teach. Children are so much easier to teach in a new way; they quickly
learn to apply new methods and to put them into practice.</i></p>

<p><i><b>Atkins</b> Innate creativity appears to occur at a much higher speed than
ordinary intellectual processes - which are painfully slow. Is it true that, in time,
these new methods of thinking - first quite slow - pass to a subconscious level and then
occur much more rapidly?</i></p>

<p><i><b>Zakarov</b> Of course. Quality passes to quantity. First we study, and then, as
if it were natural, we begin to think in this new way. For example, if you ask a centipede
what leg he's using, he will stumble if he has to stop and think about it. The children
are already working on this &quot;intuitive&quot; level - rapidly applying creative
principles. They no longer have to wrack their brains when it's necessary to invent
something new. They just take, for example, the &quot;method of focal object&quot; and
there you have 14 new designs of pens!</i></p>

<p><i><b>Atkins</b> Do you consider it useless for adults to study TRIZ?</i></p>

<p><i><b>Zakarov</b> No. It is entirely possible. But it is more difficult for adults to
overcome &quot;psychological inertia.&quot; These methods we are employing are successful
in shattering psychological inertia pretty well. You should be in the room when my husband
Alexei and his colleagues are attempting to teach adults! For most of these adults,
thinking in a new way is relatively easy - after they have been exposed to TRIZ - but not
always! They have more difficulties, in comparison with children, whose minds are more
open.</i></p>

<p><i><b>Atkins</b> Does this form of thinking come more naturally to some people than to
others?</i></p>

<p><i><b>Zakarov</b> Yes, but TRIZ is a universal theory. It can be applied, even strictly
mechanically - without much creative thinking - and it still works. Anyone who uses it
will profit, and will know what to do when a problem arises - even without creative
thinking.</i></p>

<p><i><b>Atkins</b> In the United States, besides teaching junior and senior
high-schoolers, and some elementary students, Dr. Kowalick also teaches TRIZ to the most
talented technical professionals from corporations. They already have a high level of
creativity, but when they add the TRIZ approach to it, the results are amazing. They
conceive next-generation product designs in just a few days. He says that TRIZ is the
greatest breakthrough to come along since Leonardo da Vinci.</i></p>

<p><i>That reminds me: I am curious about something quite specific. You are probably
familiar with the &quot;golden mean&quot; and the &quot;golden section&quot; discussed by
Leonardo da Vinci. Does TRIZ use this as one of its principles?</i></p>

<p><i><b>Zakarov</b> In general, TRIZ uses all the achievements of human thought. The main
thing is that it excludes trial and error, choosing immediately the best of a multiplicity
of possible solutions.</i></p>

<p><i>All this required extensive preparatory work by many people who &quot;came
before.&quot; My husband Alexei is one of those people. He has been downloading a huge
card index database of inventive problems and solutions into his computer. This
information is a part of the TRIZ approach. Rhetorically speaking, &quot;TRIZ helps
children to live in a changing world.&quot; It is important for anyone to know how to
rapidly and creatively respond to a changing world. After all, the dinosaurs became
extinct because they failed to adapt to new conditions.</i></p>

<p><i>One form of preparatory work involved selective reading. For a quarter of a year,
the children studied Altschuller's How to Become a Genius. The part of that book they
liked the most was the chapter on &quot;how to resist blows.&quot; This is something which
anyone who introduces something better to society has to learn. Society has not always
been pleasant with someone who discovers something new or radical.</i></p>

<p><i><b>Atkins</b> What are your plans for the future?</i></p>

<p><i><b>Zakarov</b> Next year we will study more extensively the laws of development of
systems. It's good to know that there are actually laws that describe the improvement of
all systems. It's also good to be able to apply the laws. This is what we will do.</i></p>

<p><i>In school, we used to use Robert Sheckly's materials for creative imagination - but
he didn't have such a system. His form of &quot;thinking&quot; is - relatively speaking -
chaotic. But TRIZ is the systematization of thought! When things are on a shelf, they are
easy to find, but when they're scattered around, somewhat randomly, in a pile . . . .</i></p>

<p><i>(Tatiana Vassilevna Zakharov moved her eyes slightly upwards while completing this
thought, as if for emphasis).</i></p>

<p><i><b>Atkins</b> Thank you, Tatiana, for your time, and for your kind invitation to sit
in on your extraordinary class. I invite you to come to our TRIZ classes as well, when you
visit the USA.</i></p>

<p><i><b>Zakarov</b> Thank you.</i></p>
