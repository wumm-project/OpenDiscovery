<p><b>ARIZ </b>is<b> </b>an acronym for the Russian phrase &quot;<i>Algorithm for
Inventive Problem Solving</i>,&quot; ARIZ is a logical structured process that
incrementally evolves a <i>complex problem</i> to a point where it is <i>simple to solve</i>.
ARIZ, therefore, is best used for complex problems.<b></p>
</b>

<p>There are several versions of ARIZ as it has been developed throughout the years. An
Americanized version of ARIZ, which includes the important features of the 1977, 1985 and
1991 versions is presented here. <b></p>

<p>What is Unique About This Version?</b></p>

<p>Although the &quot;Classic&quot; nine parts of ARIZ are kept as part of the framework,
there are new learning features in this version:

</p><ul>
  <li>a new top level flowchart for ARIZ is provided. This is done in a data flow diagram
    format, with the inclusion of three new macro steps and clearly shown feedback loops not
    previously outlined. (Attachment 1) </li>
  <i>
  <li>Knowledge Maps</i> for each of the major steps (Attachments 2 &#150; 10) </li>
  <li>Introductory &quot;<i>Purpose</i>&quot; headers for each part</li>
  <li>Helpful &quot;<i>Notes</i>&quot; with insights to accelerate the ARIZ learning curve</li>
</ul>
<b>

<p>Why ARIZ?</b> </p>

<p>Complex problems cannot be solved in just two steps. For those problems which are so
complex, that they cannot be solved with any other tools, TRIZ includes the algorithm ARIZ
to follow which will facilitate the problem-solving process. </p>

<p>ARIZ<u><i> is not</i></u> an equation, but rather a multi-step process asking you a
series of questions that integrates different pieces of TRIZ. ARIZ is a <i>very</i>
&quot;solution neutral&quot; process: i.e., it takes preconceived solutions out of the
problem statement. It starts you at a position that assumes the nature of your problem is <i>unknown.</i>
ARIZ reacquaints you with your problem by allowing you to see your problem with a fresh
pair of eyes. </p>

<p>ARIZ:

</p><ul>
  </p><ul>
    <li>is a process of problem reformulations</li>
    <li>is logical and disciplined</li>
    <li>continually reinterprets the problem</li>
    <li>is the main TRIZ method for solving conflicts</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It utilizes:

</p><ul>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Ideality for an understanding of the Ideal Solution to the problem</li>
    <li>Contradictions, by working first with the <i>technical contradiction</i>, then the <i>physical
      contradiction</li>
    </i>
    <li>Resources of the system</li>
    <li>Scientific effects</li>
    <li>S-field modeling and Standard Solutions</li>
    <li>the 40 Principles</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that ARIZ is<u><i> more than 50% problem reformulation</i></u>!
It is only through this guided reformulation that complex problems can be solved.</p>
<b>

<p>What is the Framework for ARIZ?</b></p>

<p>As mentioned before, there are the nine &quot;Classic&quot; high level steps in ARIZ.
The number of sub-steps vary from version to version of ARIZ..</p>

<p>The three new macro level processes with their respective nine &quot;Classic&quot;
parts are: </p>

<p>ARIZ is a series of steps and questions that guide you through your problem. Since ARIZ
is highly iterative, the steps and questions do not necessarily occur in a linear fashion,
although Parts 1.0 through 4.0 are sequential. The &quot;<i>Macro Flow Chart for ARIZ</i>&quot;
shows an integration into a well-tuned <i>Plan-Do-Check-Apply</i> cycle (Attachment 1).</p>

<p>I. Restructuring of the Original Problem </b>(Attachments 2 &#150; 4)</font></p>

<p>The first three steps of ARIZ both analyze and transform the problem. We begin with
simple schematics that physically represent the initial system as we know it. The emphasis
on &quot;basic function&quot; moves us to the &quot;mini-problem&quot;, a formulation and
intensification of two conflicts, and keener insights as to the actual resources of the
system. The development of the Ideal Final Result and the Physical Contradiction positions
us to come up with concepts of solution for the second macro step &quot;<i>Removing the
Physical Contradiction</i>&quot;. Because the reformulations and unique analysis prepares
us for concept solution, this macro step can be thought of as the &quot;Plan&quot; in the
PDCA cycle.<font SIZE="4"><b><i></p>

<p>Purpose of Part 1 &quot;Analyze the System</i>&quot;:</b></font> Part 1 transitions you
from your original problem statement to a more &quot;inventive&quot; modification of your
problem through the use of the &quot;mini-problem&quot; and the formation of the
&quot;technical contradictions.&quot; Simple schematics of the system conflict help build
a problem of the model in terms of the conflict and basic function. </p>

<p>II. Removing the Physical Contradiction </b>(Attachments 5-7)</font></p>

<p>The next three steps are three opportunities to arrive at concepts of solution for the
problem. The removal of the Physical Contradiction elegantly lends itself to an
uncompromised solution. However, if we still cannot remove the Physical Contradiction
after Part 4.0 &quot;<i>Separate the Physical Contradiction</i>&quot;, then we must move
into Part 5.0 &quot;<i>Apply the Knowledge Base of Effects, Standards, and Principles</i>&quot;.
Still again, if we cannot remove the Physical Contradiction after Part 5.0, perhaps we
need to proceed to Part 6.0 &quot;<i>Change the &#145;Mini-Problem&#146;</i>&quot;.
Because we are actively coming to solution through the repeated efforts to remove the
Physical Contradiction, this macro step becomes the &quot;Do&quot; in a PDCA cycle.<b></p>
<font SIZE="4"><i>

<p>Purpose of Part 4: &quot;Separate the Physical Contradiction&quot;</i>:</font></b> Part
4 separates the physical contradiction in order to eliminate it. The technique of
&quot;Smart Little People&quot; enables a different view on utilizing resources in order
to minimize changes in the system and its respective cost. If a solution is found at this
time, go to Parts 7 &quot;Review the Solution and Analyze the Removal of the Physical

<p>Summary of ARIZ ARIZ is considered an advanced technique of TRIZ. It is <i>NOT</i>
TRIZ, but is an inclusive piece of TRIZ. It requires precise definitions of all parts of
the problem and iterative use of all the TRIZ problem solving methods as ARIZ moves you
back and forth from the Functional Domain and the Physical Domain at the supersystem, the
system, and the subsystem levels. This elegance of &quot;guided&quot; problem
reformulation thoroughly and elegantly defines functional requirements and necessary
physical parameters of solution concepts.</b></p>

<p>Although ARIZ is meant for complex problems, begin using ARIZ on more simple problems
for practice application. Notice the quality of solution you arrive at with problem you
thought you were very familiar with!<font SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>Janice Marconi, President of Marconi Works, International, is an innovation specialist
in company-wide innovation and creativity, both researching and helping organizations
achieve their own flavor of innovation. She has been a researcher and practitioner of <i>TRIZ,</i>
the Russian problem solving methodology for innovation, since 1994. She&#146;s the
co-developer of <i>The Seven Creativity Tool Boxes</i>, with Dr. Helmut Schlicksupp,
formerly of the Frankfurt Battelle Institute. Her latest development<i>, Moderated
Knowledge Mapping&#153;,</i> creatively combines mindmapping, functional analysis and
German Metaplanning/Moderation methods. Her clients include the Naval War college,
Inter-American University of Puerto Rico, the Secretary of Defense, the Federal Quality
Consulting Group, and Computing Devices International. She received her masters degree
from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and her bachelor&#146;s degree from the University
of Connecticut.<b></p>
