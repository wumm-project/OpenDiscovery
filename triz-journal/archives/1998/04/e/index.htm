<p>Both the classical and software-based TRIZ methods rely heavily on the use of analogy
as a teaching method and as a problem solving method. Typically, the TRIZ practioner
decides what problem to solve, and frequently redefines the problem by any of the
following methods:</p>

<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Using ARIZ&#151;<a href="../d/index.htm">see the article in this
      issue by Marconi</a></li>
    <li>Using individual tools of ARIZ &#150;see tutorials by this author on the Ideal Final
      Result and on Finding the Zones of Conflict in The TRIZ Journal archive, and the articles
      by Gregory Frenklach in this issue and earlier issues, and James Kowalick&#146;s articles
      on triad analysis and S-Field analysis.</li>
    <li>Using other tools of problem analysis&#151;Quality improvement tools, theory of
      constraints analysis, etc.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The pratitioner then selects specific tools that will solve the re-defined problem. The
40 Principles of Problem Solving are the oldest tools of TRIZ, and exemplify the use of
analogies. (See the tutorial article on Contradictions by this author in July, 1997, and
the book report in this issue on the new translation of Altshuller&#146;s book on the 40
Principles by Lev Shulyak.) The principle is selected, either by means of the
contradiction matrix, or by other means. The method is the same, regardless of the
resource (books, software, class notes, etc.) :

</p><ol>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Read the principle. Some solutions will become obvious immediately.</li>
    <li>Read the examples. Examples for each principle in the Altshuller book and in the
      software packages come from a wide variety of sciences, such as mechanical engineering,
      agriculture, materials processing, etc. </li>
    <li>Use the examples to gain understanding of the principle and create a solution to your
      problem.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>While teaching TRIZ, I have observed that this method works for about 70% of the
students, who are mostly technical professionals in engineering and manufacturing, as well
as a significant minority of people who are applying TRIZ to solve non-technical problems.
But, about 30% of the people I have observed have difficulty between steps 2 and 3; that
is, they do not make the connection between the examples of the principle and their own
problem, so they don&#146;t get any benefit from the principle or the examples.</p>

<p>To help them, I developed the method that is shown in the rest of this article.
Surprisingly, people in the &quot;70% group&quot; who had not appeared to need help with
understanding the analogies, frequently use the worksheets and report that they get
additional insights from taking the time to analyze the analogies in this manner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The outline of the method is as follows:

</p><ul>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Perform functional analysis or Su-Field analysis to identify the object acted on, the
      object doing the action (the tool, in Su-Field language) and the force or energy or field
      by which the force is transmitted. Do this for your problem, and for the example.</li>
    <li>Identify the system elements in your problem and in the example. You will need to do
      this twice for the example, once for the initial situation, and once for the improved
      situation. The elements of the system are</li>
  </ol>
</ul>

</p><ul>
  <blockquote>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Object</li>
      <li>Tool</li>
      <li>Energy transmission</li>
      <li>Transmission means for the energy (Altshuller referred to this as the &quot;limbs&quot;
        of the system)</li>
      <li>Guidance and control of the tool</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <ol start="3">
    <li>Identify what changed in the example between the initial situation and the improved
      situation.</li>
    <li>Apply this finding to your problem&#151;change the same element as the one that changed
      in the example.</li>
  </ol>
</ul>

    nail by the hammer is mechanical. In the modified system, not shown, a pneumatic hammer is

    that some changes in the transmission mechanism and the guidance and control might be
    needed if the energy source changes. The worksheet has been completed for the example of a

<p>The table suggest that I change the energy source, and possibly the energy interaction.<font SIZE="2"> </font>Possible energy sources include small gasoline or propane motors,
flywheel systems that store energy during the downhill motion, etc.</p>

<p>I invite other teachers of TRIZ and practioners of TRIZ to use this method of examining
analogies, and to communicate your results to me, so that the method can be refined and
used by all. </p>
