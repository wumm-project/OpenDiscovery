<p>When we join two, three or more systems to form a super-system we expect that the
super-system will have additional properties (qualities), which none of the joined systems
themselves had. When we perform such transitions joining together a system with it's
anti-system - the results are especially good. Let's try to understand why.</p>

<p>First of all let's assume what we will understand as anti-system for our system.</p>

<p>All systems are aimed to perform certain function(s) or action(s). Thus for the
anti-system for our system we will understand the system which performs the contrary
(opposed) action(s).</p>

<p>For example, if our system performs action &quot;to join&quot; - its anti-system will
be system which performs the action &quot;to separate&quot;.</p>

<p>Every action changes specific parameters of the object of the action. Thus when we join
together action and anti-action we receive the additional action, which is connected with
stabilization of this specific parameter. And if we take into account dynamization
(according to Dynamization Principle) of the joined action and anti-action we receive
dynamization of the point of the stabilization. </p>

<p>Thus when we join a system and its anti-system into a super-system we get two
additional actions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol type="a">
    <li><b>Stabilization </b>of the specific parameter ;</li>
    <li><b>Dynamization</b> of the point of this stabilization</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, joining together of the calorifer ( air-heater) and refrigerator enables
us: to increase temperature, to decrease temperature, to stabilize temperature and to
change the point of stabilization. The new device (conditioner) works according this
principle of getting four actions.</p>

<p>According to the Ideality Principle we have to use the same type of energy (field) to
perform these four actions (changing, anti-changing, stabilization and the point of the
stabilization changing).</p>

<p>Let's name these four actions together &quot;functional block&quot; and type of energy
for their performance &quot; field type.&quot;..</p>

<p>For example, if we use electrical separation the &quot;field type&quot; of the action
&quot;to separate&quot; is electric. If we use as the separator a centrifuge the
&quot;field type&quot; of the action &quot;to separate&quot; is mechanical. Of course,
every level consists of sub-levels. And according to the law of &quot;Transition from
macro to micro level&quot; the lowest sub-levels are mechanical ones and the highest
levels are electromagnetic, magnetic and so on.</p>

<p>Thus we can write the next rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p>If you want to increase the efficiency of your system, transit to<br>
    functional block with the same field type of its actions.</p>
    </b>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Functional block is very controllable. It enables us easily to divide the contrary
demands in time, space and relations and to resolve sometimes very hard problems.</p>

<p>For example, let's take the electrolytic gold coating process. We want to receive the
gold coating only on specific areas of the surfaces. The use of contact masks takes a lot
of time to place and then remove them. The screens without contact don't give absolute
protection ... If we will transit from this system to functional block we will see that we
have four actions: </p>

<blockquote>
  </p><ul>
    <li>gold coating, </li>
    <li>gold discoating (removal)</li>
    <li>stabilization of the gold coating (thickness and place of the coating) </li>
    <li>dynamization of this point of the stabilization.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>You can easily resolve this problem now. Enjoy yourself resolving it. (send your
answers to editor@triz-journal.com--we&#146;ll publish the best of them.)</p>

<p>And, at last, here is maybe the main point. We took existing TRIZ principles (laws)
and, like in mathematics, get the new &quot;formula&quot; based on these principles. Maybe
it is time to speak about &quot;Theoretical TRIZ&quot;? </p>

<p>We can summarize this method as a five step algorithm, as follows:</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Functional Block Algorithm</b>:</p>
<b>

<p>Step 1</b>. Determine the function of your system.</p>
<b>

<p>Step 2</b>. Determine the anti-function and system which performs it (sometimes it
isn't so simple task, but try it because anti-function always exists). </p>
<b>

<p>Step 3</b>. Transit to a super-system joining together the system and its anti-system
to make it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol type="a">
    <li><b></b>Determine the two additional action for your system, which are connected with
      stabilization and dynamization of the stabilization point. You can receive them, joining
      together system and anti-system.</li>
    <li><b></b>Determine the field types for the function and anti-function.</li>
    <li><b></b>Make sure that they are equal, if they are not equate them according to the
      highest level.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>For example, if the function has mechanical field type and anti-function has the
      magnetic one - try to transit from mechanical level to magnetic one. <i>Important:</i>
      Equating of the field types of functions is very useful when we join any systems into a
      super-system(not only system and anti-system).</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>

<p>Step 4</b>. Transit from number of carriers to the only carrier which will perform all
the actions of the functional block. <i>Important:</i> This step also is very useful when
we join any systems into a super-system (not only system and anti-system).</p>
<b>

<p>Step 5</b>. Change field types for the actions of the functional block to develop new
concepts for your system according to the line &quot;macro <font FACE="Wingdings">à</font>
micro&quot;:</p>

</b>

<p>Important: This step also is very useful when we join any systems into a super-system
(not only system and anti-system).</p>
