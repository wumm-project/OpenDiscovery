<p>Since 1995, Technical Innovation Center has been working with Genrich Altshuller--
developer of TRIZ -- to create a TRIZ study institute in the United States. Last year we
reached a formal agreement providing for the establishment of a non-profit institute in
his name. </p>

<p>This March, several TRIZ providers from across the U.S. met to lay the groundwork for
the Institute. Now, we can all make this dream a reality. Interested parties can help
establish the Institute and participate in forming its direction. Here is a brief list of
possibilities:

</p><ul>
  <li>Exchange of innovative ideas.</li>
  <li>TRIZ research &amp; development.</li>
  <li>TRIZ translations &amp; publications.</li>
  <li>High school and college innovation curriculums. </li>
  <li>TRIZ conferences.</li>
  <li>Interactive Web site.</li>
  <li>Distribution of TRIZ tools &amp; publications.</li>
  <li>Furthering the world-wide appreciation of TRIZ.</li>
  <li>Funding for targeted solution research.</li>
</ul>

Altshuller Institute, please contact:</p>
