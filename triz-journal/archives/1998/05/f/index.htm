<h1>Where Does TRIZ Go From Here?</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We&#146;ve watched TRIZ - something old in the former USSR - become
  something new in most countries of the western world - primarily in western Europe and the
  United States. Although the use of TRIZ by American companies is still relatively in its
  infancy, TRIZ itself has a long history, and the rate of improvement and discovery that it
  has enjoyed during it&#146;s pre-western years has slowed down for several reasons. If the
  concept of S-curves is to be believed, we can predict that (1) TRIZ is near the top of its
  S-Curve (relating to its effectiveness in problem-solving), and that (2) some other
  approach or methodology may be waiting in the wings to ultimately replace it. Before this
  occurs, however, there are some facts, and some questions, to be answered concerning the
  employment of TRIZ in the west.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fact: Without a doubt, some western commercial companies and other
  organizations have already significantly benefited from using TRIZ to solve difficult
  problems and create new designs.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fact: There is no question that TRIZ works, and works well.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Question: Will enough commercial companies and other organizations
  become aware of the powerful capabilities of TRIZ, seeking to implement TRIZ for their
  professionals, and thereby pushing TRIZ &quot;over the hump&quot; of resistance that it
  ultimately needs to conquer, in order to be adopted on a large scale?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fact: Some few commercial and other organizations have been
  disenchanted with TRIZ for only a few reasons: poor training; lack of customer
  consciousness on the part of TRIZ offerors; aggressive claims made by offerors without
  delivering; etc.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Question: Will a nucleus of good TRIZ training be developed in
  sufficient mass, to the point that the power of TRIZ will spread by word of mouth, alone?
  Will broad-based professional societies and industry forums recognize the value of TRIZ?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fact: There are currently several offerors of TRIZ software selling
  their wares, not one of which has yet gotten over the business hump where the software has
  become a &quot;household&quot; name, desired by those technical professionals who solve
  problems and design next-generation technical systems.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fact: When software first appeared, some &quot;classical&quot; TRIZ
  practitioners did not even want to discuss software. Some are using it, but privately
  saying that software is not needed. And others swear by it.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Question: Is there really a market for TRIZ software, and is that
  market appreciable in size, or will it be a narrow specialty market?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These and other &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;questions&quot; have been,
  and continue to be intriguing to observers of the TRIZ scene. TRIZ is different from most
  other technical tools and approaches. It was not &quot;born&quot; in the west. It was born
  in the former USSR, the brainchild of one brilliant mind (Altshuller) and then later, the
  brilliant minds of several TRIZ disciples and other TRIZniks.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is nearly ten years since TRIZ effectively came to the United
  States. Only a few American companies have adopted it with open arms, to the point where
  they look at it as a &quot;secret weapon&quot; in the global competitive race. But even
  these companies have not yet fully experienced the depths and breadth of the power of
  TRIZ. It will be interesting to watch what happens. We invite readers to send in their
  observations and opinions to our &quot;Letters&quot; column.</p>
