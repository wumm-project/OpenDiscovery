<p>Editor&#146;s note: This is the first in a series of TRIZ Puzzles and Examples that has
been offered to The TRIZ Journal by Jacob Skir. We will publish the case one month, then
the answer (or several answers, from readers and from the author) the following month, and
a new puzzle. Send your solutions to editor@triz-journal.com.</i></p>

<p>A SMART CAR</p>

<p>When you have a long car, you have a certain opportunity in a crash (may you not need
it): there is &quot;crush space&quot; that absorbs energy in a road accident. But the
today's tendency is shortening a car for some understood reasons (parking, etc.). Then you
have a problem: the short overall length eliminates much of the &quot;crush space&quot;
that in longer cars absorbs energy in a crash.</p>

<p>So, the contradiction looks as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  </p><ol>
    <li>A long car absorbs energy in a collision but has &quot;clumsy&quot; dimensions.<br>
      <font SIZE="4"><img SRC="Image39.gif" border="0" WIDTH="472" HEIGHT="137"></font></li>
    <li>A short car has convenient dimensions but doesn't absorb energy.<br>
      <font SIZE="4"><img SRC="Image41.gif" border="0" WIDTH="290" HEIGHT="246"></font></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Believe it or not, there is a new generation of &quot;tiny cars&quot; and one of them
is a two-seater less than 5 feet long which claims to retain the crashworthiness of a
full-size sedan. (This claim is made despite the installation of the powerplant in front
of the driver, which usually endangers him in a collision. I myself heard of an accident
where the motor of the car entered inside the body of the car and smashed everything.) But
in the &quot;tiny car&quot; the motor remains a motor and the passenger and driver remain
in their places.</p>

<p>Surely, a certain modification has been done, but the frame or the car uses no special
&quot;fantastic&quot; materials for absorbing energy. It simply uses one of the Inventive
Principles.</p>

<p>Could you in a few minutes conceive its main idea?</p>
