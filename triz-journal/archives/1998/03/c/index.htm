<p>Lateral thinking is a thinking concept that was introduced by Edward De Bono more than
30 years. It is a supplement to the traditional analytical sequential thinking. Both are
needed, and lateral thinking brings creativity and new concepts into the process when the
analytical thinking has led us into a dead end. Becoming skillful in lateral thinking
requires practice. Lateral thinking forces us away from patterns that have deep grooves in
all of us, and we all know that such behavioral grooves are very difficult to get out of.
Ideation&#146;s Problem Formulator, a technique that was added to TRIZ to help develop a
clear view of the exact nature of the problem that must be solved, can help us here. There
is a clear link between TRIZ, and then specially the Problem Formulator, and Lateral
thinking. </p>

<p>Generally the Problem Formulator provides means to achieve ESCAPE and PROVOCATION by
generating suggestions for lines of solutions. ESCAPE and PROVOCATION are the two basic
processes of Lateral Thinking. These terms are explained in De Bono&#146;s book: Lateral
Thinking for Management, Chapter 4. Problem Formulator lists several Escape-ideas
(searches for alternative ways to look at the problem).&quot;Provocation&quot; is provided
by looking more deeply into the suggested escape-routes, even if they seem impossible and
useless.</font><i><b></p>

<p>Changing ideas by Avoidance</b></i><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>One of the most important chapters in Edward De Bono&#146;s book &quot;Lateral Thinking
for Management&quot; is &quot;Changing ideas by avoidance&quot;. This chapter deals with
the techniques of avoiding dominating ideas. Lateral thinking is not specifically
concerned with problem analysis, nor is it concerned with proving an idea to be
inadequate. Lateral thinking is concerned with moving on to a different idea. The aim is
to generate different ideas and to escape from the old ones. </p>

<p>The approach in problem solving that most of us are trained to do is to find the core
of the problem and focus attention on this. Thus we run the risk of overlooking hidden
solutions that would appear if the problem system was considered from another angle.
Lateral thinking teaches us to look at the problem from new angles to get away from
patterning. </p>

<p>Change of entry point </b></p>

<p>In most cases of day-to-day problem solving the problem is too simply expressed. Using
de Bono&#146;s technique of changing entry point makes it necessary to set up a chain of
problem statements. Thus it becomes easy to enter the chain of problems at any link in the
chain. Using the Problem Formulator, this comes automatically. Triz always includes at
least one useful effect and one harmful effect (problem) in the link. Having the useful
effect into the chain is an improvement relative de Bono&#146;s technique.</p>

<p>A very simple example from the chapter in De Bono&#146;s book is how city planners in
London tried to solve the problem of traffic congestion in London by using street parked
cars as the only entry point. They ended up with regulations that required each new office
building to have adequate park facilities attached to it. Later on they were forced to
shift their entry point to cars moving in and out of London. From this entry point, it was
obvious that providing every new building with car park would only increase the problem by
encouraging people to go by car to work. So the regulations were changed again. Seems very
obvious, but it takes at least a small amount of creativity. If the city planners had been
using the problem formulator at least they would have been able to establish the above
graph. This graph leads to several new entry points, they will all come out of the problem
formulator list.</p>

<p>1. Find a way to eliminate, reduce or prevent (Traffic congestion), under the condition
of (Street parked cars) and (Traffic moving in and out of city).</p>

<p>2. Find a way to benefit from (Traffic congestion).</p>

<p>3. Find a way to eliminate, reduce or prevent (Street parked cars), under the condition
of (Traffic moving in and out of city).</p>

<p>4. Find a way to benefit from (Street parked cars).</p>

<p>5. Find a way to eliminate, reduce prevent (Traffic moving in and out of city), under
the condition of (Going to work).</p>

<p>6. Find a way to benefit from (Traffic moving in and out of city).</p>

<p>7. Find an alternative way to provide (Going to work), which provides or enhances (Work
is done), and doesn't cause (Traffic moving in and out of city).</p>

<p>8. Find a way to enhance (Going to work).</p>

<p>9. Find a way to resolve CONTRADICTION: (Going to work) should be for providing (Work
is done), and should not be for not causing (Traffic moving in and out of city).</p>

<p>10. Find an alternative way to provide (Work is done), which doesn't require (Going to
work).</p>

<p>11. Find a way to enhance (Work is done).</p>

<p>Quota of Alternatives</p>

<p>The natural search for alternatives is directed to finding the best approach. In
lateral thinking, however, one is not looking for the <i>best</i> approach but for <i>other</i>
approaches. The emphasis is on novelty and difference, not on suitability. The
alternatives in the &quot;natural&quot; search are the reasonable ones which fit in with
the general idea of the problem. The alternatives considered in a lateral search may at
first sight appear to be quite unreasonable. De Bono suggests to list up to 5 alternatives
(more than 5 will often be discouraging) in which we look at the situation in a different
way. This is his technique of &quot;Quota of alternatives&quot;, The problems will be
discussed and followed, and they may lead to new approaches. De Bono mentions that the
following may happen in this process:

</p><ol>
  <li>Escape from rigidity of one way of looking at a problem</li>
  <li>Generate new ideas even if no new approach is followed up</li>
  <li>The discovery of a new approach which itself is worth following up</li>
  <li>One of the alternative approaches, though useless in itself, can trigger a new approach.</li>
  <li>By generating alternatives, one becomes more ready to appreciate and understand
    differing viewpoints of others.</li>
</ol>

<p>But De Bono teaches no obvious <i>technique</i> to set up the new entry points or how
to find the various alternatives in the Quota of alternatives. What could be more suitable
for this than the list of suggestions generated by the Ideation Problem Formulator? The
formulator is not shy and will suggest event the most provocative alternatives that very
few would have dared to suggest even in a brain storming session!</p>

<p>De Bono uses the following example to demonstrate the technique of &quot;Quota of
alternatives&quot;:</p>

<p>&quot;Consider the problem of a business which requires highly trained operators (for
instance telephone operators). After an extensive training during which they do not do
much work but are paid a salary, the operators leave with their new qualifications and
find more lucrative work with a business that has paid nothing toward their
training.&quot; </p>

<p>Using the Problem Formulator to describe the problem we get the following graph:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><img src="figure2.jpg" alt="figure2.jpg (20513 bytes)" border="1" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="483" HEIGHT="266"><br>
    <em>Figure 2. Relationships for the problem of retaining skilled operators</em></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The Problem Formulator also generates possible solution paths. They are shown on the
next page together with De Bono&#146;s suggested solutions from using lateral thinking. It
is remarkable to see the clear connection between the suggestions coming out of the
Problem Formulator and the suggested solutions from De Bono. The Problem Formulator covers
them all, but not as specific as De Bono. This is because the Problem Formulator provides
suggestions for new points of entry. </p>

<p>Problem Formulator&#146;s suggestions (Solution space)</p>

<p>1. Find an alternative way to provide (World class operation of system), which doesn't
require (Highly skilled operators).</p>

enhances (World class operation of system), and doesn't require (Increasing operator
qualifications).</p>

<p>4. Find a way to enhance (Highly skilled operators).</p>

<p>5. Find an alternative way to provide (Increasing operator qualifications), which

<p>De Bono suggests</p>

<p>A: Take only trained people, do not train at all.</p>

<p>(This can be derived from 3)</p>

<p>B: Subsidize job training in this field as part of general education having nothing to
do with business itself. Or provide a direct educational service.</p>

<p>(This can be derived from 6 and 4)</p>

<p>C: Simplify system so that training is not complex and costly</p>

<p>(This can be derived from 8)</p>

<p>D: negotiate contracts which call for a minimum period of service after training</p>

<p>(This can be derived from 17)</p>

<p>E: Charge for training by deduction from salary with repayment during service years</p>

<p>(This can be derived from 17)</p>

<p>F: Provide salary and job structure so that there is no incentive to leave</p>

<p>(Also derived from 17)</font><i><b></p>

<p>Finding the solutions using Triz</b></i><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>Using Triz-operators will provide guidelines that will lead us into the more specific
alternatives. Since this is a non-technical issue, it is natural to concentrate on the
General operators. As an example, take statement 17: <i>Find a way to eliminate, reduce or
prevent (Operators leaving the company), under the condition of (Operators become
attractive to other companies). </i>Using the Triz general operators on how to eliminate,
reduce or prevent we find several, the most relevant being

</p><ul>
  <li>isolation</li>
  <li>vaccination/creating immunity</li>
  <li>exclude the source</li>
</ul>

<p>The operator &quot;Isolation&quot; leads us to De Bono&#146;s alternative D and the
operator &quot;vaccination&quot; leads us to De Bono&#146;s alternative F. </p>

<p>Lateral thinking is not an easy subject. It requires training and insight.
Ideation&#146;s Problem Formulator is probably the best tool one can find to automatically
generate the food for thought that Lateral thinking thrives on.</p>
