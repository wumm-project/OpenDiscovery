<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ states that inventive solution of a problem is such solution that
overcoming some contradictions [1]. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The contradiction means literally &quot;saying 'No'&quot;, but more
generally refers to the propositions which assert apparently incompatible or opposite
things. The idea of contradiction was introduced by George Berkeley about three centuries
ago [2]. As the main point of critique of the formal logic developed by G.W.F. Hegel
between 1812 and 1816, contradiction is the most popular concept for introducing
dialectical ideas. For example, F. Engels wrote in the end of XIX century &quot;Unity
(Interpenetration) of Opposites&quot; a basic &quot;Law of Dialectics&quot;, and V. I.
Lenin said about it that &quot;The splitting of a single whole and the cognition of its
contradictory parts is the essence ... of dialectics&quot;. Lenin draws attention to the
fact that the contradiction is central not just to &quot;logic&quot; (as normally
understood) but cognition (analysis), and that the dialectical concept of contradiction is
not the contradiction between two things external to one another, but the contradiction
which is at the essence of a thing. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dialectics was the official and the only ideology in the former Soviet
Union, moreover every citizen of USSR had to study it as well as works of Lenin, Marx and
Engels in a school. Perhaps, that is why TRIZ was created in the former Soviet Union, and
the principal concepts of TRIZ is the contradiction.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In general various contradictions can be separated into three major
groups: </p>

</p><ul>
  </p><ul>
    <li>natural</li>
    <li>human-like </li>
    <li>technique-like.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More detail scheme of contradictions is shown in the figure 1, adapted
from [3]. The consecutive reformulation of the contradictions, arouse by the problem,
occurs during the solution of a problem in the framework of TRIZ. Each following
contradiction makes our understanding of the problem better. </p>

<p>&nbsp;The TRIZ methods of &quot;win-win&quot; resolution of technical and physical
contradictions are excellently represented in G. Altshuller&#146;s well-known books (see
e.g., [1]), so we describe them shortly just because we would like to ask the readers to
apply these methods at the end of this paper:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. The technical contradictions have the following form: </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An action is simultaneously useful and harmful; the introduction (or
amplification) of the useful action or the recession (or easing) of the harmful effect
leads to deterioration of some parts of the system (i.e. the sub-systems) or the whole
system, e.g., an inadmissible complexity of the system. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The technical contradiction represents the conflict between TWO PARTS
of a system. <i>For example, we want to increase the brightness of welding area and
decrease the temperature of the process. </i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An inventive situation is usually inherent in some groups of the
technical contradictions in the system. The choice of the certain contradiction from the
group means transition from an inventive situation to the beginning of the problem
solution.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reader can find different matrixes for resolution of the technical
contradictions in References 1,3 -5,9. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. The physical contradictions have the following form: </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A given zone ( element ) should have the property A to execute
necessary function and the property non-A /anti-A/ to satisfy the conditions of a problem.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The physical contradiction implies inconsistent requirements to a
physical condition OF THE SAME element. </p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, we want that insulator in semiconductor chips has low
dielectric constant on order to reduce parasitic capacities and has high dielectric
constant in order to storage information better. </i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Successful formulation of the physical contradiction shows usually the
problem's nucleus. The contradiction is extremely intensified in this case, that often
makes the problem's solution straightforward.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Usually some of the separation principles [1,3] helps to resolve the
physical contradiction.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">G. Altshuller also had studied so-called administrative contradictions,
i.e. contradictions between human body and technique [1]. At the first glance such
administrative contradictions should be located between human-like and technique-like
contradictions at the figure 1, but more detail analysis shows that the administrative
contradictions could be included in the human-like contradictions [3]. Recently E. Kurgi
(private communication, 1995) suggested the idea of mathematical contradictions in TRIZ. <i>For
example, you need to work with a mechanism which is described by the following system of
equations:</p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Symbol">ì</font> <i>a + b = x<br>
</i><font FACE="Symbol">í</font> <i>a + b = y<br>
</i><font FACE="Symbol">î</font> <i>x =/= y</i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is too early to discuss these contradictions in non-special
literature although such contradictions can potentially arise within the context of
automated control. This concepts of the mathematical contradiction is a part of current
research by The TRIZ Experts.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We divided the natural contradictions into two groups.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fundamental contradictions show that natural laws limit possible
solution of a problem. <i>The impossibility to have temperature below 0 degree K or speed
above the light velocity are the examples of fundamental contradictions. </i>Perhaps, such
contradictions represent only our current knowledge and some of them can be eliminated in
future.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cosmological contradictions represent restrictions caused by Earth
conditions. <i>For example, it is impossible to keep any weight at thin beam because the
gravity at our planet, or a car cannot exhaust pure hydrogen because of explosive
interaction with oxygen in our atmosphere. </i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a contradiction is not possible to overcome, we can rather speak
about a trade-off solution of the problem. Such kind of solutions is more typical for the
human-like contradictions.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The human-like contradictions can be divided into three groups (see the
figure). It seems possible to resolve the first and second of them in the framework of
TRIZ paradigm.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In general, the human-like contradictions have the following form: </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anything is required to make, to receive some useful result, to avoid
the harmful (undesirable) effect, but it is not known how to achieve the result at some
acceptable level. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such form of a problem reminds an inventive situation that is well
known in TRIZ, and often occurs during innovations. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems useful to categorize the human-like contradictions according
to the major restrains to innovation at different society levels (see the table below). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is simple hierarchy between different levels of the human-like
contradictions, and it is easy to break Individual or Managerial restrains than Cultural
ones. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The knowledge of the society level to which is the human-like
contradiction belongs and types of restrains help choose the strategy for the
problem&#146;s solution. The following methods are developed in the framework of TRIZ by
Altshuller, Zlotin-Zusman, Sibiryakov, Pevzner, Kaplan, Pinyaev, Vertkin, Savransky and
others<sup>+ </sup>.</p>

<ol type="A">
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Methodology of elimination of the Managerial contradictions itself
    (alike Goldratt&#146;s TOC but not limited only by the &quot;tree-cloud&quot;
    constructions [6] );</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Few models of development of creative persons (e.g., activation of
    imagination);</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Few models for development of innovative organizations
    (unfortunately, it seems that most of them don't applicable to western companies);</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Algorithms of the transition from the human-like contradiction to the
    technique-like contradiction (especially powerful when an initial conflict is between
    human body and technique);</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Model of resolution of the contradictions between person and culture
    constrains of society;</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Model of resolution of Managerial conflicts at a collective level
    during different stages of product development;</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Timing of innovation in the organizations participating in industrial
    competition; </p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Policy of investment based on TRIZ ideas about technical evolution
    and innovation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In opposite to the methods of resolution of the technique-like problems
the approaches A) - H) above are not evaluated in many case studies yet, so the extensive
research is needed in this field. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, the various registers of physical, chemical, etc.
effects are collected in TRIZ [1,3,7] in order to overcome the Individual lack of
knowledge or memory. These registers are very fruitful on the background of growing deep
specialization of modern engineers and managers.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is necessary to note, that studies of the human-like contradictions
in TRIZ intersect with psychology, management and other social disciplines but often the
researchers don&#146;t know results of studies in other fields. For example, M. Oakley
proposed several reasons for resisting an innovative change [8] :</p>

</p><ul>
  <li><i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To protect social status.</p>
    </i></li>
  <li><i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To protect an existing way of life.</p>
    </i></li>
  <li><i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To prevent devaluation of capital invested in an existing
    facility.</p>
    </i></li>
  <li><i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To prevent a reduction of livelihood because the change would
    devalue the knowledge or skills presently required.</p>
    </i></li>
  <li><i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To prevent the elimination of a job or profession.</p>
    </i></li>
  <li><i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To avoid expenditure such as the cost of replacing existing
    equipment.</p>
    </i></li>
  <li><i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because the change opposes social customs, fashions and tastes and
    the habits of everyday life.</p>
    </i></li>
  <li><i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because the change conflicts with existing laws.</p>
    </i></li>
  <li><i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of rigidity inherent in large or bureaucratic
    organizations.</p>
    </i></li>
  <li><i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of personality, habit, fear, equilibrium between
    individuals or institutions, status and similar social and psychological considerations.</p>
    </i></li>
  <li><i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of tendency of organized groups to force conformity.</p>
    </i></li>
  <li><i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of the reluctance of an individual or group to disturb the
    equilibrium of society or the business atmosphere. </i></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is easy to see that the Oakley&#146;s list [8] coincides with the
conclusions about major innovation restrictions founded in TRIZ. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The human-like contradiction itself has usually low heuristic value,
does not show a direction to the answer. That is why contrary to the solutions of the
technique-like contradictions, trade-offs in the human-like contradictions can frequently
provide &quot;strong&quot; resolutions. Perhaps, this difference is based on various types
of systems: the technical systems are usually have determine nature while nature of the
human systems is probable or stochastic. </p>

<p>The following paragraph represents the examples of such trade-offs :</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The upper restrains level of society (cultural) causes barriers to an
effective individual or organizational problem solving. Creation of multinational joint
ventures seems be workable to overcome such cultural barriers, just because the
organizations that operate in uncertain environments are more likely to innovate. On the
other hand, larger organizations with differentiated or decentralized branches and/or
nurture informality young senior management are more likely to innovate, so sometimes
anti-monopoly laws play against technical progress. On the other side, the organizations
act as catalysts or stockades to effective individual problem solving, e.g., often the
occupation with status and its associated symbols extinguish individual innovation. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, we would like to ask the reader to make the following
exercise:</p>

</p><ul>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">read once again the discrepancy of the famous Polish writer that is
    given in the epigraph of this paper;</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">convert it into the technique-like contradiction;</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">find a resolution of using the known TRIZ methods. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
