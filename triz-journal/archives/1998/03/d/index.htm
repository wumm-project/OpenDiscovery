<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As TRIZ method has an increasingly number of followers, we invite
readers to take a few steps back when encountering the enthusiasm that it arouses. After
discussions with these so-called &quot;TRIZ wizards&quot; (Snyder, 1996), as well as with
practitioners who have put the method in practice, the aim of the present article is to
initiate a rethinking about the limitations of the method and to present our research
activities in the area.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introduction </b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a socio-economic context as tricky as the one we are faced with, the
company that possesses only a slight lead, will have automatically the advantage over its
competitors and will dominate the market as long as it maintains this lead. The mastery of
quality tools which allows new products to be put on the market is almost identical from
one company to the other (Sushkov, 1996). Thus, there they are, evenly matched in terms of
competitiveness and &quot;time-to-market&quot;.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The philosophy of Value Analysis, developed by many quality gurus,
remains attractive. Its steps are clear and structured, helped by many tools allowing
engineers to progress in a systematic way when designing new products. But a certain stage
of this progress concerns generating ideas, finding solutions, solving problems, so
systematic thinking is no longer present in this process. One vaguely cites terms such as
: organize a brainstorming session, create a reflection group whose role will be to put
into practice various creativity tools, etc. In the end, even if the processed problem is
modelised, returned, trolled and husked, the heart of the imaginative device, the one that
takes the decisions, is always in fact a human being alone who come up with the idea. This
random generation process of ideas is like a black hole in the fourth step of V.A.,
because the stage of idea generation can never be estimated in advance. If one can, after
a significant number of experiments, estimate the time of the idea generation stage, when
the problem reaches a superior level of complexity, this time span might evolve
exponentially. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then along comes TRIZ method, with its tremendous aptitude to generate
concepts, to stimulate the creativity of engineers and everything became systematically
simpler. A greater number of ideas are generated, their pertinence is very real and
today's number of case studies are advancing almost as rapidly as the enterprises that
have understood the importance of Altshuller's work. Thus, in a V.A. strategy everything
becomes simpler, the generation of ideas is quasi - systematic, the pertinence of found
solutions is not brought into question and the black hole becomes clearer&#133; . </p>
<font SIZE="4"><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Statement of TRIZ limits</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among all the ambushes that enterprises meet during a period of
reflection on their product development needs, there often appears to be a zone of
uncertainty in the accuracy of targeting these needs. Indeed, there is often a tendency to
overestimate these needs and to move straight on to innovation and in this quest of
excellence the different people involved can become a bit lost. Engineers, technicians,
collaborators and other financial supporters don't hold the same view on innovation. A
single solution to this last problem could address many issues in one time. There is
therefore the important task of understanding the real needs, in terms of innovation, by
succeeding in increasing precision to define the enterprise's problem.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The socio-economic context no longer needs to be described. Actually,
the &quot;fast - innovation&quot; is a reality and everyone hurries to appear to be the
most effective in this area. In this gigantic poker game, some accept defeat and others
put down their hands claiming that they hold the wild cards, but all this undeniably cheat
at the data game. One does not innovate to innovate, otherwise we might lose ourselves in
the abyss of a sterile reflection. The effort is, nevertheless, entirely laudable. Indeed,
entirely launched in the name of innovation, an enterprise should be motivated to move
forward, not to remain stagnant, while competitors find out later, what they could have
found now. And if this sentiment is shared by all members of the company, it is an entire
hierarchy that is committed to this policy going toward an ideal, looking for ideas, in
search of the &quot;blessed&quot; solution, the unavoidable enlightening of spirit. The
arrival of TRIZ could have let us to think that this generation of ideas was going to be
systematized, so innovate&#133; again and again&#133; .</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But things are not that simple. After interviews with TRIZ users, some
limits of the method came to light. These limits are of three orders :</p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Limit 1</b></i> : The system's complex nature imposes a growing
diversity of technological areas producing uncertain data. When instating a problem and
processing the method, a fundamental phase on which the pertinence of the released
solution depends, resides in its projection vis-à-vis the standards identified by
Altshuller. This diversity sometimes creates a problem of identification of the model with
these standards (Royzen, 1996) in which the quantity is voluntarily limited to optimize
the time in which the solution is found. This method has required years of development,
the evolution of systems for such a long time would require that TRIZ benefits from
implementation, to be enriched with these new data. For example It might be difficult to
locate a problem parameter such as noise or bandwidth (out of the 39 available) when
processing the conflict solving stage with the contradiction matrix. Is the presence of a
new technique like &quot;Tailor the DNA of a bacteria&quot; necessary to be added to the
40 actual principles. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One solution to this would consist of building a still-improved set of
parameter, permanently available (on the net for example). A center of TRIZ development
linked with an international patent agency, could then implement all TRIZ resources when
necessary.</p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Limit 2</b></i> : All innovation concerns the important evolution of a
product or a system from one generation to the next (Cavallucci, 1997). This evolution,
while applying TRIZ, concerns essentially the product, the system, which is the object of
the prospective of transformation. But all products, all systems, are manufactured by
another system (of production) who is also found at a certain stage of its evolution. The
problem is that TRIZ can concentrate only on one or on the other, and the object, the
product, is at the very heart of the innovation. Then the production system introduced to
generate it often becomes a victim of this innovation. As an example to this, handling gas
is difficult and a solution can be found in converting it into a liquid but such solution
requires a lot of new changes in the production system. A second limit appears here,
therefore, which concerns the link that unites all products to their production system.
This very important link can not be absent when first modeling the problem. We have been
requested to undertake a second TRIZ application on the production system itself, after
having developed the product. This is indeed a foreseeable possibility but nothing obliges
us to further develop the production system if this latter supports the product evolution
without itself evolving. Moreover, what about situations where the production system does
generate an opportunity for a product evolution? For example, glass finish was improved
not by changing the glass or solid roller to convey it, but with a liquid tin bath that
&quot;floats the glass&quot; (Altshuller, 1984) a new production system that generates a
product evolution. This second limit, seems very important to us and merits a closer look
(see later in this paper)...</p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Limit 3</b></i> : One stage of product development is a response to a
demand. This need, often expressed by consumers or simply by laws of market
internationalization, continues its path to stages of being modeled, research of
solutions, rapid prototyping and tests, industrialization before entering its phase of
major development. During all these stages the product undergoes before its
implementation, a multitude of tools are made available to engineers and researchers to
help them in their task. TRIZ is in fact only one link in this chain of the product
development. A limit appears here which concerns the tackling of product development
problem on a global scale. In other words, is it possible to efficiently integrate TRIZ
with others tools (Verduyn, 1996) (even fitted ones) at global development stages of a new
product? The engineer, when facing with the hundreds of tools available to help him in
every product development stages, might be a bit lost in term of efficiency if he simply
pick one of them whenever needed. A simple approach to the pertinence of some tools and
methods is given figure 1.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Links with the production system</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the limits evoked previously consists of establishing links
between the innovation that the method tends to generate and the production system that is
supposed to generate it.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Actually, only a few parameters are taken into account and the current
trend of tendency demands that one first proposes the innovation and that only, and then
the production system to manufacture it. Of course nothing prevents the inventor from
using TRIZ again on the production system itself to make up for the problem (the
contradiction) answer of the innovation, without any guarantee of success. It appears
clearly, here, that the ideal would consist in evaluating the different products and
production systems evolution degrees at the very first of a TRIZ application.</p>

Pn+1) with or without development of the production system (from Sn to Sn+1).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the first tasks of this methodology M therefore consists in
knowing if we are in a configuration of a P and S linked evolution. The next step consists
in specifying the degree of evolution of S and if it is a function of P. </p>

system and product. </p>

innovation clearly shown by Altshuller (Altshuller, 1988).</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Table 1: Degrees of inventiveness according to Altshuller</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Considering that the production system is also a system (such as the
product) it appears logical to think that S follows these same degrees of innovation.
Their respective level on a life cycle curve is identical as well. What is left to define
is what links Xs and Xp.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can a product P evolving from x=1 see S evolving from x=1 ?</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not obvious at all, Xp can evolve from x levels without Xs
necessarily evolving. One can nevertheless draw several conclusions :</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Conclusion 1</i> : The ideal situation would be to maximize Xp
evolution while minimizing Xs.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Conclusion 2 </i>: There is, for all innovation in a product/process
couple, a profitability switchover point to be defined in terms of Xs and Xp.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>Conclusion 3</i> : It would be useful to benefit from an indicator
being able to define the system's degree of evolution. The difference between S and P
could then be established and would give important information's regarding the
profitability of the evolution. This criterion &quot;E&quot; (figure 3 and 4) could then
be integrated into decisions to be taken before the evolution, because logically, to
minimize E is to minimize the cost of evolution.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Conclusion</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These limits, that are here only cited, must be studied in depth so as
to perfect a method which has just arrived on the industrial market and has been of such
great help. But in this endless quest of innovation, the enterprise is no longer alone to
face the &quot;blank page syndrome&quot; generated by the solution research stage. From
the moment it can rely on increasingly effective innovation tools, whose objectives are
very clear : to conduct a research prospective related to the consumer's needs, to
identify the totality of a system's environment's functions, to minimize costs and
&quot;time-to-market&quot;. Among all this, TRIZ remains the only to propose ideas,
technological research targets. That is to say, it aims at increasing engineer's
creativity, by exposing a problem beyond individual ideas, through a prism whose optical
particularity is to send back an image (a model) of the problem to a group of others,
previously solved, to propose proven solutions. But do not believe that it brings ready
made solutions, TRIZ only provokes these solutions with the ideas it gives to engineers
who still remain the quality analysis keepers. Finally, as any tool, TRIZ has its own
limits. The research path remains therefore open for reflection on continuous improvement
of TRIZ itself. But in the current socio-economic context, the strength of the method
resides in its aptitude to reduce research solution steps during product development. It
allows the generation of innovating concept in a tremendously short time. All this is
possible without making any concessions on the answer's quality and pertinence. Many
enterprises, universities, research laboratories and other professional organisms have
already understood this and the extent of competence in TRIZ is gradually being
hierarchised.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Undoubtedly, an interesting path of research is in the thorough study
of the links between the product and its production system. This study which has only been
touched upon in this article will possibly extend to the definition of a global and
generic methodology of product's and engineering system's evolution. An indispensable
theory for any enterprise/company heading towards the twenty-first century.</p>
