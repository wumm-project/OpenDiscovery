<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Dr. Kowalick is considered to be the leading American TRIZ master. He
regularly teaches CREATING BREAKTHROUGH PRODUCTS, a two-day overview session for
executives at Cal Tech&#146;s Executive Leadership Center in Pasadena, California. His
corporate clients include Fortune 500 as well as smaller leading-edge, high-tech
companies. RLI offers in-company training for technical and professional staff members,
who bring their most difficult problems and design challenges to the training session, and
leave with solutions - often patentable. Dr. Kowalick directs a four-level certification
program for TRIZ practitioners. This is conducted both in-person and by Internet. Dr.
Kowalick holds numerous patents. He is a registered professional engineer, actively
engaged in all engineering and scientific disciplines.)</i></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HISTORY</u> </b>Studies on the science of creativity began at the
Leonardo da Vinci Institute in 1975. The first development was &quot;triads,&quot; a
symbolic engineering design language to support conceptual product design. The triads
approach is applied in the first stage of engineering design - the concept design stage -
to (1) solve difficult technical problems, (2) conceive next-generation designs, and (3)
forecast breakthrough designs of the future.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the early 1980&#146;s, the Leonardo da Vinci staff customized an
engineering optimization approach used in the second stage of engineering design - robust
design. Robust design is conducted using the principles and practices of Dr. Genichi
Taguchi. After a product or process design is conceived, much work remains to be done.
Functional performance needs to be optimized and cost minimized. Product and process
performance should be independent from generally uncontrollable effects such as (I)
variations from parameter target values, (ii) material degradation, (iii) manufacturing
variability, (iv) environmental variability, and (v) the practices and treatments of
users. The output from the second stage of engineering design is a world-class,
&quot;robust&quot; product or process. Its performance is insensitive to variabilities of
all kinds.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the late 1980&#146;s the Leonardo da Vinci Institute revisited
the creative design approach called TRIZ. TRIZ was only beginning to be introduced to
companies in western nations at that time. The brilliance and creative genius behind this
approach lies with its discoverer and developer, Genrich Altshuller. Altshuller and his
assistants contributed to the evolution of TRIZ (the Theory of Inventive-Problem Solving)
from the late 1940&#146;s through the last decade. The TRIZ approach is the creative
revolution of this century. Corporate R&amp;D groups, including engineering designers
charged with creating breakthrough products and processes, have been using it to great
advantage. World class companies are using it to achieve marketplace domination.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ADVANCED TRIZ DEVELOPMENTS</b></u> Shortcomings of the TRIZ approach
were recognized by &quot;TRIZniks&quot; themselves, right from its inception. At the
Leonardo da Vinci Institute, these shortcomings have been categorized into several areas.
Each area is the subject of advanced development by staff members. A brief description of
each of these areas and its shortcomings is presented below. Along with each description
is a description of the advanced developments achieved at the Leonardo da Vinci Institute.</p>
</font><b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">SHORTCOMINGS OF TRIZ, AND ADVANCED DEVELOPMENTS</b></p>
<font SIZE="3"><u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AREA # 1. PROBLEM-SOLVING ALGORITHMS</b></u>. The current algorithm
used by the TRIZ community is &quot;ARIZ&quot; - Algorithm for the Solution of Inventive
Problems. ARIZ is periodically upgraded and refined by the Russian TRIZ community.
Reactions by American engineers attempting to use this algorithm has generally been
negative. ARIZ is long and cumbersome, time-consuming to learn, and far from
&quot;user-friendly.&quot; It is narrowly focused, aiming at &quot;the best&quot; design
solution. It does not offer many, if any, design alternatives. It is a dialectic
logician&#146;s tool, but not a convenient engineering design tool. It focuses primarily
on the logical flow of the problem-solving process - not on the important relationships
among the objects and actions of a technical system.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advanced Developments at the Leonardo da Vinci Institute</b></u>. The
staff at the Leonardo da Vinci Institute developed eight problem-solving algorithms. Users
can print out generic design solutions in a matter of minutes. Alternative design
possibilities (i.e., solutions to problems) are presented, allowing users to approach
problems from several different angles of perspective, depending upon various constraints.
The entire problem-solving procedure is friendly to engineers and scientists. Each
algorithm is an &quot;inventive operator.&quot; Applied to the technical system of
interest, and to the functions in these technical systems, it generates design solutions.
Each of these eight algorithms have been successfully tested by technical professionals
from RLI&#146;s client companies. These companies use the resulting designs to achieve
breakthrough products for their respective markets - this leads to market capture.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AREA # 2. FUNCTIONAL LANGUAGE</b></u>. &quot;S-Fields&quot; is the
functional language used in TRIZ to describe generic relationships among essential
&quot;objects&quot; and &quot;actions&quot; in the technical system. &quot;S-Field&quot;
or &quot;Substance-Field&quot; models are used to describe generic problem situations as
well as generic solution situations. A large S-Field database has been generated by the
TRIZ community. The core of this database is a collection of &quot;standard
solutions&quot; - relationships between standard generic problems (expressed as S-Field
models) and standard generic solutions (also expressed as S-Field models). Seventy
standard solutions have been identified. The main problem with S-Fields is that they are
not complete. They inadequately express and describe engineering functions. Users of the
TRIZ approach - particularly new users - find it difficult to create S-Field models that
validly describe objects and actions of their technical systems. S-Fields have always
&quot;suffered&quot; from being incompletely developed.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advanced Developments at the Leonardo da Vinci Institute</b></u>.
Functional analysis is a specialty of the Leonardo da Vinci Institute. The S-Fields of
TRIZ describe &quot;interactions&quot; - not entire functions. Triads - a development of
the Institute - are symbolic forms that fully describe both functions and functional
relationships. S-Field practitioners teach that &quot;A function is complete when it
includes all the elements of an S-Field.&quot; But what is &quot;complete&quot; is the
interaction - not the function. An interaction occurs between two &quot;objects,&quot;
while a function requires three &quot;objects&quot; in order to be complete. In S-Field
analysis, one definition of &quot;field&quot; is &quot;a source of energy that permits the
required interaction between two objects to be completed.&quot; This definition is often
useful, but sometimes it is misleading. The fact is that it is an object
&quot;behind&quot; the field that is responsible for completing the interaction.
Substance-Field analysis at its best is still somewhat &quot;hazy&quot; and incompletely
defined. For the reasons discussed above, some TRIZniks have (at least publicly) abandoned
its use.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A &quot;triad&quot; is a group of three &quot;objects&quot; that
represent a necessary requirement for a function to exist. Triads are discussed in a
previous paper published by the TRIZ Journal. One significance of triads is that they open
up far more solution possibilities for problem solvers. Triads have been incorporated in
the Leonardo da Vinci Institute&#146;s problem-solving algorithms discussed above. The use
of triads is an important part of RLI&#146;s in-company TRIZ training sessions.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AREA #3. FUNCTIONAL DECOMPOSITION</b></u>. To some limit, a function
can be divided or &quot;decomposed&quot; into sub-functions that occur sequentially. This
fact is well know, and is a practice used in traditional value engineering and analysis
(VAVE). The result is a &quot;Functional tree diagram&quot; describing the functions of a
technical system. TRIZ and other problem-solving practitioners currently use S-Field
analysis, functional analysis, and flow-charting techniques to describe functional
relationships among parts of a technical system. The generation of functions (and goal
statements connected with them) is, however, still a subjective process. This process is
not conducive to developing a better understanding of a problem situation. The process
inadequately assists problem solvers who want to quickly hone in on the right problem
definition.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advanced Developments at the Leonardo da Vinci Institute</b></u>. The
discovery presented above states that &quot;<i><b>All functions require three objects in
order to manifest</b></i>.&quot; This universal law of triads applies to all events,
functions, and phenomena. Another law has been discovered at the Institute: &quot;<i><b>All
functions capable of being decomposed, can be decomposed into a fixed number of
&#145;universal&#146; sub-functions.&quot;</b></i> This law has been practically exploited
at the Leonardo da Vinci Institute. The pharmaceutical industry develops and manufactures
new drugs as therapeutic agents to treat various diseases. An American company,
BioFutures, applied the law of functional decomposition to this problem: &quot;How to
predict, in chemical detail, molecules that will act as therapeutic agents for selected
diseases?&quot; They used a &quot;Molecule Predictor Algorithm&quot; to find solutions -
in the form of specific drug molecules - to this problem. This universal law of functional
decomposition can be applied to identify, in compositional detail, any molecular substance
or mixture, for application to any selected technical function. This is a major
breakthrough in materials synthesis.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AREA #4. TRIZ INSTRUCTION AND TRAINING</b></u>. Initially the only TRIZ
training available in the west was from TRIZ practitioners from the former USSR. A severe
language problem still prevents effect communication (as can be verified by scanning the
offerings of some TRIZ providers on the world wide web). There are also cultural problems.
With a few exceptions, TRIZ providers from the former USSR do not understand the needs of
western companies. Too often their &quot;style of service&quot; has included customer
intimidation (sometimes involving legal threats or litigation about intellectual
property), and a lack of customer consciousness. One former USSR TRIZ provider is on
record as stating that &quot;total quality&quot; practices are unimportant. Another
problem: TRIZ as taught in the former USSR is too often presented in a strictly
&quot;academic&quot; way. One former USSR practitioner recently stated, &quot;It takes
twenty years to learn TRIZ.&quot; Yet, engineers from western companies want to be able to
use and apply TRIZ to real problems, and to obtain design solutions, in several days. The
number of western consultants and trainers who offer TRIZ training and consulting is
limited. Among these, only three (in the author&#146;s opinion) are capable of actually
applying the TRIZ approach - during a training session - to real problems. There are also
national security considerations connected with the use of non-citizen consultants and
with firms who employ non-citizen TRIZ practitioners.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advanced Developments at the Leonardo da Vinci Institute</b></u>. RLI,
through the Leonardo da Vinci Institute, has developed &quot;Experiential TRIZ
Courses&quot; and instruction manuals. The basic problem-solving session is three days in
length. Class size is typically twenty. Class participants bring their toughest problems
and design challenges with them to the session. They get to use software during the
training session - to accelerate the problem-solving and breakthrough design session. They
leave the session with design solutions. Often these solutions are patentable. These
sessions have been conducted on both consumer and defense products.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ Internet Training and TRIZ Certification</b></u>. The Leonardo da
Vinci Institute has an advanced TRIZ course for those who have already had TRIZ basic
training, and who have already applied TRIZ to create improved and breakthrough designs.
There is also a four-level TRIZ certification program for TRIZ practitioners who want to
rapidly increase their creativity and problem-solving capabilities. The certification
program includes one in-person class day per month, with reading and homework assignments
between classes. All communication is by the Internet, fax and phone. The four TRIZ
certification levels are: Basic; Practitioner; Expert; and Master. Certification is highly
individualized and personalized, according to the pace and desires of the student.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AREA #5. TRIZ FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, HIGH SCHOOLS, AND UNIVERSITIES</b></u>.
TRIZ training for children, high-schoolers and university students has been sporadic at
best in Russia and former USSR countries (see February TRIZ Journal articles on TRIZ and
education). Yet there is an unaddressed, national need for creativity in all areas in the
USA.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advanced Developments at the Leonardo da Vinci Institute</b></u>. For
the past three years, Dr. James Kowalick has been teaching TRIZ to high-schoolers in
northern California. The results have been miraculous. High school students are changing
the ways they think about problems. Their creative capacity is significantly increased.
They are able to handle very difficult problems with relative ease. Some elementary
students have also received training. Dr. Kowalick is also teaching a local (California)
class of adults - some of whom plan to teach TRIZ to children. The Leonardo da Vinci
Institute is developing teaching manuals for use in grade schools and high schools, and
also developing courses for teachers of gifted and talented students who want to teach
nationwide.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AREA #6. BIOMEDICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL TRIZ APPLICATIONS</b></u>. There
is no organized effort in this direction in Russia, or in any of the former USSR
countries.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advanced Developments at the Leonardo da Vinci Institute</b></u>.
Working with a start-up firm, BioFutures, Inc., the Leonardo da Vinci Institute tailored
and customized the TRIZ approach for use by technical professionals in the biomedical and
pharmaceutical industries. BioFutures applied this approach to drug delivery systems -
products such as inhalers and transdermal patches - and has discovered means of increasing
the capability of transdermal drug systems to deliver large-sized drug molecules -
previously believed to be undeliverable.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AREA #7. TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH OF TRIZ ARTICLES FROM OTHER LANGUAGES</b></u>.
Many of the older TRIZ books written in Russian, and published in the former USSR, are
obsolete or outdated. There are, however, recent TRIZ books, articles and reports from
various countries (former USSR countries, Israel, the Netherlands, Germany, etc.) on
current applications and advanced developments. Until recently, this information was
unavailable in English.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advanced Developments at the Leonardo da Vinci Institute</b></u>. The
TRIZ Institute is allied with the PQR Group and the Leonardo da Vinci Institute to
translate important books, articles and reports on TRIZ, into English. To continue this
important work, they have formed a Translation Consortium made up of several corporations
(and a few individual consultants). Annual membership in this Translation Consortium
supports the translational effort. Consortium members receive copies of the translated
material which they use for study purposes only. The Leonardo da Vinci Institute has a
collection of twenty-one TRIZ books written in Russian. Companies and individuals
interested in joining the Translation Consortium can call the TRIZ Journal offices at
909-949-0857.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AREA #8. ACCELERATED PROBLEM SOLVING</b></u>. Little effort has been
made by the TRIZ community to accelerate the problem solving process. In part, this is
because of the fragmentation that has occurred in the former-USSR TRIZ community. Many
former USSR practitioners have moved to other countries. The population of TRIZ
organizations in countries of the former USSR has steadily decreased. There is minimal
organized effort to advance the TRIZ approach (with the possible exception being in the
area of invention software). Even with invention software, the role of TRIZ has been
significantly de-emphasized.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advanced Developments at the Leonardo da Vinci Institute</b></u>.
Leonardo da Vinci Institute developments have significantly accelerated problem-solving in
two ways: (1) through their introduction of the TRIZ problem-solving algorithms mentioned
above; and (2) through the incorporation of &quot;triads&quot; into the problem-solving
process. As a result, corporate users report significantly increased productivity. These
developmental activities have resulted in the rapid conception of breakthrough products
for a broad range of industries.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SUMMARY</b></u> TRIZ advanced development efforts at the Leonardo da
Vinci Institute, a division of the Renaissance Leadership Institute, Inc., are continuing.
The goal is to offer American companies the capability to rapidly conceive breakthrough
products. These products capture significantly more market share.</p>
