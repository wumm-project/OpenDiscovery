<h1>The Research (Diagnostic) Problems&#146; Classification.</h1>

<p>There is a specific type of engineering problem which is connected with discovering
(exposing, finding out) causes (reasons) of different phenomena, which take place in
technological systems. Simply speaking we have to answer to the question: &quot;Why does
such a thing occur?&quot; or &quot;What is this element intended for?&quot;. Such problems
are called (in TRIZ) research (diagnostic) problems.</p>

<p>In TRIZ, a method has been developed which enables us to transform such diagnostic
problems into inventive ones. Instead of asking: &quot;Why does this occur and what does
cause such a result?&quot; (diagnostic problem), we transit to the inventive problem by
asking the question: &quot;How could we get this result?&quot; In order to find the
solution for this transformed problem we can use all the TRIZ instruments (called
&quot;operators&quot; in earlier articles of this series.) The only condition is to use
only resources of the system in order to find the solution.</p>

<p>The algorithm, in which such a principle is realized, was developed by B.L.Zlotin and
A.V.Zusman about 8-9 years ago, but the weak point of this algorithm is the connection of
the TRIZ instruments. It is not so clear which instrument have to be chosen in order to
resolve the &quot;transformed problem.&quot;</p>

<p>The right classification of the diagnostic problems would enable us to choose the
proper TRIZ instrument(s) for the diagnostic problems&#146; solving (under solution I
understand a hypothesis which have to be then well-checked).</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two types of the research (diagnostic) problems:</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Something happens in our system and we don&#146;t know the reason .</b></p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>1. During the wafer&#146;s coating by metal in sputtering machine through the mask the
metal appears on the wafer under the mask too. The possible reason is that between the
mask and the wafer arises space, but why does it happens? </p>

<p>2. The parts of the refrigerator&#146;s compressor don&#146;t wear out. What is the
reason?</p>

<p>3. The surface polishing with help of an abrasive ferromagnetic grain in rotating
electromagnetic field is more effective than it was predicted on base of the engineering
calculations. What is the reason?</p>

<p>4. The hot air drier is switched on if the hands are near it. How does it sense the
hands?<b></p>

<p>2. The function of the specific element of the system is unknown.</b></p>

<p>For example: The tram wire is made in form of zigzag. Why?</i></p>

<p>Diagnostic problems of the<i><b> first</b></i> type can be transformed into two types
of the inventive situations:</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a) One has to perform some function in order to get the result which has to be
explained;</b><i></p>

<p>For example: </p>

<p>1. How could we raise the mask upon the wafer in order to create the space?</p>

<p>4. How could we sense the hands near hot-air drier?</i><b></p>

<p>b) One has to eliminate an undesirable effect (UDE) in order to get the result which
has to be explained;</b><i></p>

<p>For example: </p>

<p>2. How could we eliminate the wear of the refrigerator compressor&#146;s parts?</p>

<p>3. The efficiency of the surface polishing with help of an abrasive ferromagnetic grain
in rotating electromagnetic field is too low. How could one increase it?</i></p>

<p>Then we transit from these situations to problems according to the rules of such a
transition:</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a) we define:</b></p>

<p>the function; </p>

<p>the object of the function; </p>

<p>the known method of the function&#146;s performing; </p>

<p>the UDE which arises if we use this known method;</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For b) we define:</b></p>

<p>the UDE; </p>

<p>the element connected with this UDE; </p>

<p>the function of this element; </p>

<p>the object of the function;</p>

<p>Then we choose the possible directions in order to resolve the problems. </p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are four possible directions:</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>- performance of the function which is connected with transformation of the
function&#146;s object;</b></p>

<p>For example: to raise the mask.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>- performance of the function which is connected with measurement or indication of the
function&#146;s object;</b></p>

<p>For example: to sense the hands.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>- elimination of the UDE which is connected with low efficiency of the function&#146;s
performance;</b></p>

<p>For example: to increase efficiency of the polishing.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>- elimination of the UDE which is connected with any harm interaction;</b></p>

<p>For example: to eliminate the compressor&#146;s parts wear. </i></p>

<p>The choice of the right direction depends on the condition: &quot;To use<i><b> only</b></i>
resources of the system in order to find the solution&quot;.</p>

<p>In order to resolve<i><b> diagnostic problems of the second type</b></i> we have to
&quot;remove in mind&quot; this element and try to determine the UDE which appears in the
super-system in this case.</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example: if the tram wire was not zigzag but of a straight line - the tram&#146;s
electrical contact would touch the wire in only one point and quickly be worn out.</p>

<p>Our problem now is to define the action or property of the &quot;removed&quot; element
which enabled us to eliminate this UDE.</p>

<p>NOTE: Actually, some of the diagnostic problems of the second type are very difficult
and in order to &quot;discover&quot; the UDE one has to consider all the stages of the
system, the &quot;removed element&quot; belongs to: manufacture, transportation, using,
maintenance, repair, utilization an so on. The stages sometimes are divided into
sub-stages in order to make easier the UDE exposure.</i></p>

<p>Every type of problems, described above can be solved as follows:</p>

<p>a. Using the known methods and our knowledge (simple cases);</p>

<p>b. Using TRIZ instruments (more complicated cases);</p>

<p>I&#146;m sure you have come across diagnostic problems in your practice. Try to solve
them using the approach, which was described above. To make this easier for you use
attached &quot;<b>Adapted Algorithm for the Diagnostic Problems&#146; Solving&quot;.</b>
It is aimed for solving of the <i><b>diagnostic problems of the first type</b></i>. Good
Luck! </p>

<p>Adapted Algorithm for the Diagnostic Problems&#146; Solving.</b></p>

<p>Transform the diagnostic problems into inventive one. Transformation is performed by
asking instead of the question: &quot;Why does this occur and what does cause such a
result?&quot; (diagnostic problem), the question: How could we get this result?&quot;</p>

<p>There are two types of problem situation the diagnostic problem can be transformed to:</p>

<p>- the first type is one that exists when it is necessary to conduct some function but
the technical facilities for it are absent or unknown.</p>

<p>- the second type arises when the problem situation is connected with undesired effect
(UDE) inside the existing technological system.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The inventive problem formulating.</b></p>

<p>If in the case of your problem the technical facilities are absent or unknown (first
type) then you are recommended to:</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Formulate the function for which realization the technical facility is absent.</b></p>

<p>NOTE: <i>Try to do it in a short formulation, which includes verb + noun.</i></p>

<p>NOTE:<i> If during the formulation of the function you run into problem then suppose
what kind of UDE would exist in the case of non-execution of this function and try to
define the action, necessary for this effect elimination. It would be a sought function <b>(the
diagnostic problem of the second type).</i></p>

<p>2. Object of function definition.</b> </p>

<p>NOTE: <i>Object is a substance towards which the action is directed. In other words, it
is something that being processed, measured and so on. Object is always some material
substance and not a parameter.</i><b></p>

<p>3. Choose some known facility for this function realization.</b></p>

<p>NOTE: <i>If you can not find this one, you can take any facility for realization of
similar functions from other branches of technology.</i><b></p>

<p>4. Define the undesired effect, which arises during the realization of the previous
step 3.</b></p>

<p>NOTE: <i>If you cannot find the known facility in other fields of technology, please,
pass the steps 3 and 4. Further, it would make easier for you to choose the direction of
problem solving .</i></p>

<p>If in the case of your problem the undesired effect (UDE) exists in the technological
system (second type) then you are recommended to:</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Formulate the UDE, which is a source of the problem.</p>

<p>2. Define the element, connected with the UDE.</b></p>

<p>NOTE: <i>You can check your definition of the element which is connected with undesired
effect. For this you may mentally remove this element from the technical system. The first
UDE in this case disappears but instead the new UDE is emerged.</i><b></p>

<p>3. Formulation of function of the element, connected with UDE.</b></p>

<p>NOTE: <i>Try to do it in a short formulation, which includes verb + noun.</i></p>

<p>NOTE:<i> If during the formulation of the function you run into problem then suppose
what kind of UDE would exist in the case of non-execution of this function and try to
define the action, necessary for this effect elimination. It would be a sought function
(the diagnostic problem of the second type).</i><b></p>

<p>4. Define for the object of function for the element, connected with the UDE.</p>

<p>1. Deposition of time and place of the IFR demands realization.</p>

<p>2. IFR formulation according the regulation:</p>

<p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

system, or by environment without function carrier.</p>

<p>PRINCIPLES OF THE PHYSICAL CONTRADICTIONS REMOVAL.</b>

</p><ol>
  <li>Division of the opposite requirements in space.<br>
    In the case when the resources element for UDE removal or for desired function realization
    must have some specific property and at the same moment must not have the same property
    (or it must have the opposite property) for non-originating extra UDE, one have to divide
    the opposite requirements in space by attaching the element of these opposite properties
    in the different space places. For reaching this one can use phase transitions, physical
    and chemical transformations, such as rise and disappearance (elimination), ionization
    with recombination, combination with decomposition and so on.</li>
  <li>Division of the opposite requirements in time:<br>
    In the case when the resources element for UDE removal or for desired function realization
    must have some specific property and at the same moment must not have the same property
    (or it must have the opposite property) for non-originating extra UDE, one have to divide
    the opposite requirements in time by attaching the element of these opposite properties
    during the different time intervals. For reaching this one can use phase transitions,
    physical and chemical transformations, such as rise and disappearance (elimination),

    In the case when the resources element for UDE removal or for desired function realization
    must have some specific property and at the same moment must not have the same property
    (or it must have the opposite property) for non-originating extra UDE, one have to divide
    the opposite requirements by system transition: attaching (temporally or permanently) to
    the part of the element one of the opposite properties while the whole element would have
    the other property.</li>
  <li>Division of the opposite properties in ratio.<br>
    In the case when the resources element for UDE removal or for desired function realization
    must have some specific property and at the same moment must not have the same property
    (or it must have the opposite property) for non-originating extra UDE, one have to divide
    the opposite requirements in ratio by: attaching the element (temporally or permanently)
    the opposite properties relatively the other elements of the system or environment.</li>
  <li>Division of the opposite requirements by incorporating the extra element.<br>
    In the case when the resources element for UDE removal or for desired function realization
    must have some specific property and at the same moment must not have the same property
    (or it must have the opposite property) for non-originating extra UDE, one have to divide
    the opposite requirements by: incorporation (temporally or permanently) some extra element
    inside the system and attaching it one from the opposite properties (requirements). This
    might be done by phase transitions, physical and chemical transformations, such as rise
    and disappearance (elimination), ionization with recombination, combination with
    decomposition and so on. As an incorporated element it is better to use something that
    already exists in the system or environment.</li>
