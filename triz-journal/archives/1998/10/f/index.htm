<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img SRC="Image55.gif" align="left" border="0" WIDTH="230" HEIGHT="121">Imagine a car mechanic
tells you about his problem. He makes use of a wrench (more correctly they call such a
tool: a socket wrench) for closing nuts. But his nuts are always different: on one
occasion he needs to close a small nut (say, ¼ inch), on the other occasion he needs to
close a bigger one (say, ¾ inch)&#133;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely, he has a set of different wrenches for various nuts. But he
wants something more convenient. He wants a socket wrench snapping <u>every</u> nut&#133;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a wrench with moving (dynamic) &quot;jaws&quot;: the jaws are
able to become wider and narrower - yet it doesn&#146;t snap every nut fully. Sometimes
the nut is half-broken&#133; The mechanic needs something more clever and still
uncomplicated.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Help the mechanic. Invent for him a socket wrench snapping every nut
(say, from ¼ inch to ¾ inch) in a full, convenient, reliable way.</p>
