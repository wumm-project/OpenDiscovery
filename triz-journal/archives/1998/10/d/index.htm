<p>Today, manufacturing companies operate in an ever-changing global marketplace. The rate
of change is increasing also. Two vital resources needed to compete and be successful are
time and information. The time to create, design, manufacture, and sell is decreasing
every day. The information via the world wide web and other electronic media is expanding
exponentially each day. The challenge before us today is to maximize the use of
information available while minimizing the time to create a product.</p>

<p>This challenge has been addressed in several areas of the product life cycle.
Concurrent engineering strategies have been employed in the design and process development
phases. Multifunctional teams work together to share information using
Computer-Aided-Design software systems, greatly reducing the time for product development.
Just-In-Time and work cell manufacturing strategies have been employed to reduce the
work-in-process manufacturing time. Manufacturing information systems optimize the
tracking and scheduling of raw materials and assembly operations. There are many other
examples of how companies have implemented dramatic changes to shorten their product
design-to-market cycle. Almost every strategy has employed the use of software systems to
increase the availability, sharing, and use of information.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there have been only evolutionary changes in the beginning stage of
product design: the stage of creating or innovation. Techniques such as brainstorming and
morphological analysis have been employed to enhance creativity through combining
expertise from teams of people to collectively generate new, innovative solutions to
problems. These strategies rely heavily on one&#146;s personal experiential and academic
knowledge, thus severely limiting the use of universal knowledge available, thereby
slowing the solution time. </p>

<p>Dr. Altshuller&#146;s Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) provides a systematic
methodology for creating innovative solutions to problems. Software packages, such as
TechOptimizer<sup>TM</sup> and Phenomenon,<sup>TM</sup> greatly increase one&#146;s
efficiency for creating innovative solutions through the application of Altshuller&#146;s
methods and rapid access of available information. The problem facing companies today is
the availability of engineers with this knowledge and training. Most engineering students
in the U.S. have no exposure to TRIZ-based methods. </p>

<p>Most engineering curriculums are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering
and Technology (ABET). ABET requires at least 1.5 years of engineering sciences and
engineering design. ABET recognizes that engineers must be prepared for engineering
practice through the curriculum culminating in a major design experience. This major
design experience is often received in a senior-level capstone engineering design course. </p>

<p>Today&#146;s engineering graduates are expected to contribute faster through the
application of an expanded knowledge base and informational tools beyond the traditional
engineering sciences. The College of Textiles at NC State University recently conducted a
review of the attributes every student should have to effectively contribute in the
industry today. These attributes are presented in Table 1. The Textile Engineering program
is engaged in an extensive review of its engineering curriculum. TRIZ-based methods are
viewed as an integral component of the curriculum. These methods impact the attributes of
engineering design, problem solving, entrepreneurial competency, physics, engineering
sciences, and information management. This paper presents a strategy for integrating
TRIZ-based methods into an engineering curriculum.</p>

<p>The Textile Engineering (TE) curriculum is a four-year (eight semesters), 124 credit
hours, ABET accredited program. Like most programs, the TE curriculum is under pressure to
do more with fewer credit hours. Therefore, TRIZ-based methods will be integrated directly
into the senior-level capstone engineering design experience.</p>

<p>The TE capstone engineering design experience spans two semesters (8 credit hours).
Prior to the fall semester, a real industrial machine (or process) design problem is
identified. If the problem is deemed by industry to be impossible or &quot;never been
solved before,&quot; then it is an excellent candidate for the students. Students are
combined into teams of five or six students. A typical problem is presented in very
general terms with typical design constraints listed in Table 2.</p>

<p>The students are provided a general plan of work to follow, shown in Table 3. The plan
of work is divided into four major phases: preparing a design proposal, conducting a
detail design plan, constructing a proof-of-concept prototype, and conducting a design
improvement evaluation. Each phase consists of a series of tasks that expose students to
the major phases of the design process. It is within these tasks that TRIZ-based
methodologies and Invention Machine software will be integrated. This plan is shown in
Table 3. </p>

<p>In the proposal design phase, students must understand the industrial problem and
redefine the problem in engineering terms. This involves breaking the psychological
inertia in the industrial definition and identifying the root-cause engineering problem to
solve. TRIZ-based methods will be employed to teach students how to identify conflicts or
contradictions and properly define engineering problems to minimize psychological inertia
to define problems that can effectively searched in generic databases. Students will use
TechOptimizer<font SIZE="2"><sup>TM</sup></font> in this project-definition process. </p>

<p>Once the problem(s) have been defined, students will be challenged to generate the
&quot;Ideal Solution&quot; based in &quot;Ideality&quot; methodology. Students will be
introduced to the &quot;40 Principles.&quot; Each student will be asked to identify
possible solutions systematically using each of these principles. These exercises are
designed to expand each student&#146;s creative thought process and prepare them for more
efficiently using TechOptimizer<font SIZE="2"><sup>TM</sup></font> and Phenomenon<font SIZE="2"><sup>TM</sup></font> to identify possible solutions.</p>

<p>Once a large number of possible solutions are identified, students will conduct a
feasibility study to determine the solution(s) that meets the industrial customer
requirements. A formal proposal is written and presented to the industrial sponsor
describing the conceptual design.</p>

<p>The second phase addresses the detailed solution design. The concepts must be
transformed into detailed plans and equipment specifications. New, smaller problems are
encountered. Students will continue to apply TRIZ-based methods to these smaller problems.
The &quot;Effects&quot; identified will direct the students to classical engineering
equations and references that will be used for parametric analysis and detail
calculations. At the end of the detailed design phase, students will have identified major
systems components including machine drawings, control algorithms, power transmission
systems, and a list of components to be purchased.</p>

<p>The third phase involves primarily construction of the proof-of-concept prototype. Now,
even more detailed design problems are encountered. Often times, economic and spatial
constraints require alternative solutions to an otherwise eloquent design. Students will
be directed back to their &quot;Ideal Solution&quot; and apply the same problem solving
methods taught in the first phase. The concept of invention evolution will be presented.
Students will be asked to begin thinking about where their design falls on the evolution
curve. At the end of the third phase, students are required to have a working prototype of
their solution.</p>

<p>The fourth and final phase is focused on engineering analysis. Students will critically
evaluate their solution to see if it meets the customer requirements. Emphasis is placed
on enhancing, modifying, and improving their prototype. Students will conduct an Su- field
analysis. They will conduct functional analysis using TechOptimizer<font SIZE="2"><sup>TM</sup></font>.
New problems resulting from the functional analysis will be solved using the TRIZ-based
methods and the Invention Machine software. A final report of recommended design
improvements will be written and an oral presentation will be made to the industrial
sponsor.</p>

<p>Beginning the Fall Semester 1998, the senior textile engineering students will be
taught basic TRIZ-based problem solving methodologies and given multiple opportunities to
apply the methods to a variety of self-generated problems. The problems start out as large
and vague. At each phase the problems become more defined and specialized. Over the course
of the two-semester, nine-month period, students are challenged to practice the inventive
problem solving methods at many levels in many different situations. The software will aid
the students in all areas of the design process, including writing their reports.</p>

<p>In summary, it is the goal of the capstone engineering design experience to prepare
engineering students to contribute immediately to any company to enhance the
competitiveness through the efficient use of time and knowledge to create innovative
processes and products. Integrating TRIZ-based methods will accelerate the creative
thought process. Using TRIZ-based software will also greatly increase the access to
knowledge and the application of the methodologies. </p>

    <u><p>Description of Problem</u></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This project is a response to the overall needs of the hosiery industry as stated by
      the industry as follows: &quot;The hosiery industry in North Carolina is being severely
      challenged by the emergence of a global economy. The industry today is characterized by
      being labor intensive, under-utilizing technology, struggling with low margins, and facing
      increased foreign competition, particularly from Mexico. The industry sees technology as a
      way to:</p>
    </blockquote>
    </p><ul>
      <li>Increase output</li>
      <li>Reduce labor costs as a component of manufacturing, and</li>
      <li>Improve efficiency.&quot; (<i>Preserving Hosiery Manufacturing in North Carolina:
        Strategies for Modernization Through Technologies</i>)</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In the hosiery production process, there are several labor-intensive operations that
      are common to most all hosiery manufacturers. The boarding operation has been identified
      by the industry as the most critical process for automation. This operation requires that
      a hosiery item (socks) be manually placed and aligned on a moving metal form every three
      seconds. The metal form temperature is maintained at 180 <sup>o</sup>F. This operation is
      an excellent candidate for automation due to the repetitive nature of the loading function
      and the less than desirable environmental conditions.</p>
      <p>Currently, 85% of the socks boarded using the INTECH boarding machine. Typical speeds
      are 20-25 forms per minute. Each type of sock may require different forms depending in the
      knit style and geometrical size of the sock. In today&#146;s market, rapid changes and
      many styles are common in the course of a day&#146;s production. There is one operator per
      machine, and the average production is 300 dozen/day (8 hours).<u></p>
