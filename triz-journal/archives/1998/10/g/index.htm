<p>On the morning of September 23, 1998, we received the following e-mail from Lev Shulyak
at the Altshuller Institute:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i><p>Subject: In memory of Genrich Saulovich Altshuller<br>
    It is with deepest regret and sympathy that I must inform the followers of TRIZ that
    Genrich S. Altshuller passed away this morning, approximately 10:30 AM, EST this 24th of
    September 1998. Please check the Institute website --- www.triz.org ---- for any
    additional details. All that we know is that the end came suddenly and peacefully in the
    presence of his family.</p>
    </i>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Genrich Altshuller&#146;s own words tell us why he has had such a powerful influence on
so many people all over the world:</p>

<p>&quot;I got my first patent while in the tenth grade. Later there were other
inventions. I worked at the patent office and had meetings with different inventors. I
became more and more interested in the mechanics of creativity. How were inventions made?
What happens in the head of the inventor?&quot; (From<i> And Suddenly the Inventor
Appeared</i>.)</p>

<p>&quot;Although people who had achieved a great deal in science and technology talked of
the inscrutability of creativity, I was not convinced and disbelieved them immediately and
without argument. Why should everything but creativity be open to scrutiny? What kind of
process can this be which unlike all others is not subject to control?&#133;What can be
more alluring than the discovery of the nature of talented thought and converting this
thinking from occasional and fleeting flashes into a powerful and controllable fire of
knowledge.&quot; (From <i>Creativity as an Exact Science</i>)</p>

<p>Altshuller devoted <i><b>his</b></i> creativity to understanding creativity and
innovation, and to the work of organizing the research to make the process that we now
know as TRIZ teachable and learnable. The decades of research by Altshuller and his
students and colleagues have made it possible people world-wide to become systematic
creative thinkers. </p>

<p>Many people who have known Genrich Altshuller, and many others who never met him but
have had their lives changed because of his influence, would like to share their thoughts.
We will print these for the next few months, then compile all the comments and send them
to his family. Please send your memorial comments to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it possible to prove that the impossible is possible? Altshuller did it. His major
  contribution to the evolution of humanity was that he proved that creativity is a feature
  everyone of us possesses. And he did not limit himself to just finding a proof - he
  created tools which help to awake, control, and use our creativity with the highest degree
  of effectiveness. Undoubtedly, Altshuller was one of the most outstanding people of the
  century.</p>
  <p>Once I phoned to an engineer who took training in TRIZ to find out about his progress
  with TRIZ:</p>
  <p>&quot;Have you ever used TRIZ since taking the course?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh, yes, many times&quot;, replied the engineer.</p>
  <p>&quot;Do you have any problems with using TRIZ&quot;? </p>
  <p>&quot;Yes! The problem is, it looks like TRIZ became a part of our everyday thinking.
  And now we can't even think about problems without TRIZ!&quot;.</p>

  <p>In my 18 years as a software engineer and manager at Bell Laboratories and Motorola, I
  have been lucky to work on interesting benchmarking, process improvement, technology
  transfer, and creativity-oriented initiatives. However, none of these programs have
  uniquely changed my perspective on engineering and creativity, and indeed, the world in
  general, as much as TRIZ. People who know me now consider me as someone who views the
  world through &quot;TRIZ-colored glasses.&quot; Altshuller's work has changed my life. He
  was to the creativity and problem solving domains what W. Edwards Deming was to the
  quality improvement domain. Altshuller's impact will be felt for years to come.

  is Henry, the American version of Genrich? I think not.</p>

  <p>I had known Dr. Altshuller about fifteen years ago in a Japanese magazine. And I found
  his TRIZ. I have great respect for his theory and his practice. It is with deep sadness
  for me to lose Dr. Altshuller. His theory gives me theoretical hints to solve problems.

  <p>I would like to make a citation from the first letter I got from Genrich S. Altshuller
  in December 1984. He wrote: &quot;Last 5-7 let TRIZ became much more powerful, our
  students began to resolve more difficult problems and get more unexpected (bold, wild)
  solutions. A new problem appeared: a person should not be afraid of &quot;wild&quot;
  ideas,...it is necessary that he can fight for these ideas.&quot;</p>
  <p>It was in 1984. Altshuller had the capability to see the future. He began to develop
  the methodology that he later named TRIZ, in 1940s. In 1980s TRIZ already existed, and
  existed Altshuller´s school. But Altshuller already knew that this is not enough. He
  already had begun to develop the Life Strategy of the Creative Person.</p>
  <p>The capability to foresee the future. And not only skills to foresee, but also the
  capability to fight for the future. That Altshuller showed and taught to us.</p>

  <p>With deepest regret, I have learned that Genrich S. Altshuller, the creator of TRIZ,
  passed away. The TRIZ family has lost its Father. On the morning of September 24, 1998.
  Altshuller had been working on a letter and discussing it with his family, when he
  suddenly died. On October 15, 1998 he would have been 73. Funeral services will be on
  September 29 in Petrozavodsk Cemetery in 2 PM Moscow time.</p>
  <p>Altshuller was one of the greatest thinkers of the century. He was a very determined
  person. He was determined to pave the way for a new way of thinking regarding problems in
  innovation. It was a noble goal. Altshuller sacrificed many great opportunities in his
  life that would have given him wealth. He preferred TRIZ Unfortunately, Altshuller almost
  had no support from Soviet Union authorities. But Altshuller and his science were
  supported by his many enthusiastic followers. </p>
  <p>TRIZ has changed the lives of many Alshuller's followers and TRIZ users. TRIZ has
  helped them to be much more creative and improved effectiveness of their work and results.</p>
  <p>I met Altshuller at a TRIZ conferences in Petrozavodsk. I kept in touch with him
  through correspondence. I was fascinated by Altshuller. I was the manager of TRIZ training
  and publishing in the Kishinev TRIZ School, the first TRIZ School to present those who
  completed a 200-hour course with certificates signed by Altshuller, without him teaching
  the course. It was also an honor to be the first publisher of Altshuller's last book,
  which he wrote together with Igor Vertkin. </p>
  <p>The importance of Altshuller's work has been highly praised by people familiar with
  TRIZ. His fame will continue to grow along with the rapidly growing number of people
  benefiting from using TRIZ. </p>
  <p>The Altshuller Institute for TRIZ Studies (www.triz.org) has been founded to promote
  TRIZ and memorialize Altshuller's priceless work, which he literally gifted to the world.</p>
  <p>The memory of Altshuller as a great person, inventor, writer, scientist, will leave in
  the hearts of his followers and TRIZ users. </p>

  <p>I never have met G.S. Altshuller, but his books changed my life. The effect of the

  life was connected with TRIZ.</p>

  <p>I would like to tell a few words on the force of Altshuller's influence on people.
  Imagine: he built the TRIZ movement when he had no tools of direct influence on his
  followers: he didn't pay them salary, he didn't have option to fire them. And yet, what do
  you think was the hardest punishment of Altshuller for those who, for instance, behave not
  fairly? His hardest punishment was: to erase your name from his notebook. That means, you
  don't receive his letters more...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most influential writer in the history of writing, Homer, described Genrich
  Altshuller when he wrote these immortal words:</p>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;<i><b>And what he greatly thought, he nobly dared</b></i>.&quot;</p>
  <p>But the world knows nothing of its greatest men. The heights that they reached were not
  attained by sudden flight. While their companions could only marvel, they toiled upward in
  the night of the unknowable, striving to make it knowable - for all to benefit. Altshuller
  was such a man.</p>
  <p>John Donne wrote that &quot;<i><b>Any man&#146;s death diminishes me, because I am
  involved in mankind; and therefore, never send to know &#145;for whom the bell
  tolls&#146;; It tolls for thee</b></i>.&quot; Even more so does the passing of Genrich
  Altshuller touch us all. He dedicated his life to a cause that dramatically raised - and
  continues to raise - the level of society. He initiated, and carried through, a
  revolution. He accomplished this task with all the odds against him, at every turn in his
  career. In this respect, he is the ultimate example of the &quot;<i><b>creative
  personality</b></i>&quot; that he studied and introduced in his writings.</p>
  <p>Genrich Altshuller has completed his role; nevertheless, he will be sorely missed. Sir
  Walter Scott warmly observes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&quot;<b><i>And the stately ships go on<br>
    To their haven under the hill;<br>
    But O, for the touch of a vanished hand,<br>
    And the sound of a voice that is still!&quot;</p>
    </i></b>
  </blockquote>
  <p>But what of us who remain? We shall continue to meet, but we shall also miss him. There
  will be one vacant chair; It would be difficult - no, it is impossible - for anyone to sit
  in that chair. We shall linger to caress him, when we breathe a grateful prayer.</p>
  <p>It is for others who were his closest friends to reminisce about their personal
  relationships with him. I never knew him personally, but I know him well, by his results -
  by his creative output - by his dedication to the truth, and to the betterment of the
  world as a place in which to live.</p>
  <p>I dedicate this touching little poem by Hafiz to the memory of Genrich Altshuller.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;<i><b>Little sleeper, the spring is here;<br>
    Tulip and rose will come again,<br>
    Only you in the earth remain,<br>
    Sleeping, dear.</p>
    <p>Little sleeper, the spring is here;<br>
    I, like a cloud of April rain,<br>
    Am bending over your grave in vain,<br>
    Weeping, dear.</p>
    <p>Little flower, the spring is here;<br>
    What if my tears were not in vain!<br>
    What if they drew you up again,<br>
    Little Flower!&quot;</p>
    </b></i>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Genrich Altshuller has been &quot;drawn up again&quot; - forever to flower and decorate
  the landscape of the present and of the future - in each of us, and in our children. He
  resides in our minds, in our experiences, in our capabilities, and most importantly, he
  will continue to reside in our hearts. May he have a safe journey.</p>

  <p>Since my first exposure to TRIZ in 1989, I have often contemplated the amazing
  contributions of Genrich Altshuller, his arduous formative years in Soviet labor camps,
  and the global impact he has made with TRIZ. Once again, like Einstein, a man who worked
  in a patent office has given the world a beacon for breakthrough concepts. Eventually, as
  the world comprehends and appreciates his legacy, he will receive the acclaim he so richly
  deserves. Altshuller was to problem solving what Mozart was to music, what Deming was to
  quality. Today, his passing is mourned, but the elegance of TRIZ which he has bequeathed
  the world lives on. Mankind was truly blessed by his genius.</p>

  is no longer with us, am I able to understand that the answer lies in the daily work in
  TRIZ that we &#150; his disciples and followers &#150; carry out. A non-destructible,
