<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The work of building of the creative person development theory was
begun nearly twenty years ago. One of the reasons to start this work was that a lot of
engineers who during TRIZ courses found great strong solutions for their problems - put
these solution away to find something less &quot;revolutionary&quot;. It looked like they
were afraid of their own strong solutions. Some of these people said honestly that they
prefer not to &quot;wake&quot; troubles trying to realize such a revolutionary solution. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is an ability to solve hard problems enough to be creative person? And
if it isn't - What else has to be taught? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first question, which G. Althuller and I.Vertkin asked themselves,
was:</p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;What does characterize the creative person in comparison with
&quot;normal&quot; one?&quot;</b></i> </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to find some regularities were analyzed thousands biographies
of people, considered by Human History as the great and creative people. As the first
result of this analysis the main characteristics of the creative person were discovered
(ref.1). They are:</p>

</p><ol>
  <li>Great (Large) Aim (Goal) which is useful for human society, new or not yet realized,
    unbelievable to most of contemporaries (heretical), concrete and ...unattainable (looks
    like physical contradiction). <i>Editor&#146;s question</i>: <i>Is this because the people
    whose biographies get written are the ones who had such large goals? If someone had a
    modest goal, who would write about her or him? This seems to be a circular logic in the
    study, to define creativity in terms of the kind of people who were studied.
    Gregory&#146;s response: Altshuller&#146;s work was criticized by some of his colleagues
    on this same point. But, this large amount of research was done, and the findings will be
    useful to many people.</i></li>
  <li>Capacity for hard work;</li>
  <li>Good abilities of problem solving; (the field of TRIZ);</li>
  <li>The package of plans and check of their performance;</li>
  <li>The fate-knock-resistance-ability; (This means the ability to take advantage of good
    luck, in order to gain Great Aim. As the factor that causes so-called &quot;good
    luck&quot; the hostile &quot;external environment&quot; is considered).</li>
  <li>At least preliminary results on the way to the Great Aim; (Without results all the
    previous characteristics are worthless). </li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second result of this research work was creation of The Life
Strategy of The Creative Person - the game which was built in form of chess play, where
the creative person plays against hostile &quot;external environment&quot; (ref. 2). In
this &quot;game&quot; are described nearly all possible moves of &quot;external
environment&quot; in order not to allow a creative person to gain the Great Aim and nearly
all possible &quot;answers&quot; of the creative person to win in this &quot;fight&quot;. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And, at last, the third result of this work were ideas which can be put
as basis of the future Great Aim Development Theory (ref. 2).</p>
