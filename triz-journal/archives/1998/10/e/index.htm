<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all, my congratulations to all the three readers for their
understanding the TRIZ fundamental rule: not to insert new materials but to use the given
ones.</p>

</p><ol>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Jose M. Vicente from Valencia suggests using folding material
    that absorbs energy. Fine! That&#146;s not the &quot;control&quot; solution but it does
    not negate the &quot;control&quot; one. By the way, it would be useful to formulate the
    items for the further research: in this case, material that absorbs energy while folding.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Fred Strauss: &quot;Put the motor in the back like in a VW
    Beetle&quot;. OK, we protect the engine and yet we don&#146;t protect the passengers&#133;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Nathan Gibson from the North Carolina State University made use
    of the Contradiction Table and came to the Spheroidality Principle. Who knows, maybe
    we&#146;ll see such a car in the future. The only request is to present the solution in
    detail, e.g., with the help of a picture.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Eric Sloan: &quot;The engine would be designed to move under the
    car on impact.&quot; This is the exact &quot;control&quot; solution. Thus the Smart car is
    built, a joint venture between Daimler-Benz and the Swiss-based Microelectronics and
    Watchmaking Industries, the maker of Swatch watches.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A two-seater less than 5 feet long, the Smart car claims to
retain the crashworthiness of a full-size sedan. Instead, the Smart car sandwiches its
powerplant under the floor; this raises the passenger compartment above the impact area in
a collision with a passenger car. The powertrain is mounted on a sliding rack to diminish
the force of a collision.&quot; (Popular Science - January 1998 - P. 82).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In short: instead of solving the problem along one dimension (i.e. a
horizontal line - from the front to the rear) - they solve the problem along the second -
vertical - dimension.</p>
