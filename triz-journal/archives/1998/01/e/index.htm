<p>The DTC (dimensions, time, cost) operator is aimed at breaking the psychological
stereotypes which are connected with an object to be improved (a car, for example).</p>

<p>According to the DTC operator rules we change:

<ol TYPE="A">
  <ol TYPE="A">
    <li>The dimensions of the system from usual to zero; or the dimensions of the system from
      usual to infinite</li>
    <li>The time from usual to zero; or the time from usual to endless</li>
    <li>The cost of the system from usual to zero; or the cost of the system from usual to
      infinite.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>Such transformations really help us to break our psychological inertia and to look at
the system from other points of view. As result it shows us new directions of the problem
solving.</p>

<p>This process can be made more efficient if:

<ol TYPE="A">
  <ol TYPE="A">
    <li>Changing dimensions relates to the object of the our system's function. For example, the
      function of the car is to carry something. Consider the car that carries an atom, or the
      car that carries a planet.</li>
    <li>Time changing relates to the system function's time of performance. For example, the car
      performs carriage during a moment, or the car performs carriage during thousand years...</li>
    <li>Cost changing relates to the function's carrier. For example, the car which costs 1
      cent, or the car which costs millions of dollars...</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>Where are your &quot;car stereotypes&quot; now?</p>

<p>This suggestion is not my invention, not at all. Look at the best analyses in the TRIZ
literature which were performed with help of the DTC operator (mainly by G.S. Altshuller
himself) and it will be clear that they were performed this way. Thus let&#146;s write
down the written above as the rule in order to use the DTC operator more efficiently.</p>
