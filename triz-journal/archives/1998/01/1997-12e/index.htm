</a>

<p>Windshield and backlight molding squeak problems have been in existence for several
years. The issue became more complicated about 10 years ago when a change from metal
molding to plastic was undertaken. Over the last five years several teams tried to resolve
the situation and a number of design alternatives were explored. Unfortunately, no robust
and cost effective solution was found.</p>

<p>A temporary solution has been developed and recently implemented by the Vehicle Program
Team that resolves this concern, however, additional materials, assembly labor and
variable cost were required. In addition, this solution only addresses the flutter (buzz)
problem and has no effect on molding squeak. </p>

<p>Since conventional problem solving techniques have not provided an acceptable solution
for the squeak and flutter (buzz) issues, <b>John Megdan and Paul Ashburn sponsored this
special project</b> that utilized an inventive problem solving methodology, referred to as
TRIZ (See Section 6 for more details). The goal of the project was two-fold:

</p><ol>
  <li>Identify technical root cause of squeak and flutter (buzz) phenomena.</li>
  <li>Develop inventive solutions that eliminate both conditions <u>without</u> compromise.</li>
</ol>

</font></b><font SIZE="3">

<p>In this phase we work closely with the Subject Matter Experts (SME's) to review any
prior test data and methods. The next step in this phase is to review prior solution
attempts to learn from past experience and ensure that there will be no duplication of
prior effort. In addition, we interview available SME's and review manufacturing processes
to acquire additional information that may not have been documented. In parallel with the
above, we collect benchmarking information and conduct a patent search to establish the
&quot;state of the art.&quot; At this point, we develop a technical description of the
problem and formulate the contradiction(s).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In this phase, it imperative that the team members adopt a structured thought process
that breaks psychological inertia. It's been our experience that outside consulting firms
overwhelm the participants with every aspect of TRIZ and fail to spend adequate time
explaining the fundamental thought process of the methodology. Ed Sickafus (SRL Physics
Department Manager) shared this concern and has developed an &quot;in-house&quot;
Structured Inventive Thinking (SIT) course that resolves this issue. It is recommended
that all team members participate in this training. </p>

<p>By this time in the project, the problem has been properly defined and the
contradiction(s) formulated. This typically results in the development of a fair number of
conceptual solutions. </p>

<p>In this phase, the team works with the TRIZ software to ensure coverage of the entire
solution space. This allows the team to look across engineering disciplines and identify
potential solutions to the problem that may have been applied in other industries.</p>

<p>The team engaged in an in-depth study of the technical background information to
develop a thorough understanding of the fundamental physics associated with the problem.</p>

<p>Over the last five years a number of alternatives have been tried and a substantial
amount of experimental work has been completed. A small team of engineers analyzed this
information and structured it in the manner consistent with the TRIZ methodology.</p>

<p>In addition, the team met with key individuals who have worked on this issue over the
last several years to develop a thorough understanding of the problem. The same list of
questions was prepared and discussed with each of the Subject Matter Experts (SME's). Most
of this information is summarized in the <i>Roadmap A</i>, page </font><a HREF="#_Ref364743577">*</a><font SIZE="3">.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>An outside company &#150; <i>Defiance STS</i>, Troy, Michigan &#150; was contracted to
perform the majority of the squeak testing. In our recent review of the test equipment
setup, several major faults were identified. Important test parameters such as humidity,
quality and handling of the test samples were not controlled, resulting in poor test
repeatability. A proposal to update the test equipment and procedure will be implemented
prior to verification testing to ensure that the test and equipment are capable of
producing valid results. </p>

<p>Based on the interviews with the SME's, it was determined that squeak is caused by a
phenomenon highly dependent on environmental conditions. Temperature appears to have the
most significant effect; competitive benchmarking has demonstrated that squeak becomes
more pronounced under cold conditions (i.e.-20<sup>o</sup>C). A sound level of 50 dB or
greater is considered objectionable.</p>

  </b></i></font>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this issue was relatively new, limited test data was available for our review.
Flutter or &quot;Buzz&quot; typically occurs while driving in a cross wind at a vehicle
speed in excess of 55 mph. These conditions can be simulated and tested in a wind tunnel
that allows for rotation of the vehicle in the test chamber and has the capability of
controlling critical environmental conditions.</p>

<p>The group classified prior solution attempts in a form of a roadmap. The purpose of the
Roadmap was to capture all attempts made during the last several years to resolve the
Windshield/Backlight molding squeak and flutter (buzz) problem. The following roadmap

<p>Windshield / Backlight squeak and rattle type problems can be classified in two major
categories:

</p><ol>
  <li><font size="2">Squeak </font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Flutter (Buzz)</font></li>
</ol>
<i>

<p>Let's consider the Squeak part of the Roadmap first:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>4.3.1.1.&nbsp; <a NAME="_Ref367177280">Layer A</a></p>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p></i>Squeak is known to be caused by a Stick-Slip mechanism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <b><p><em>4.3.1.2.&nbsp; Layer B</em></p>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Traditionally stick-slip phenomenon in the moldings have been dealt in one the three
possible ways: promote motion, prohibit motion and in-the-rabbit design.</p>

<p>Stick-Slip phenomenon can be approached from either the position of promoting motion
(slip) or prohibiting motion (stick) of the molding lip at the contact point with the
sheet metal. In-the-rabbit design is a fundamentally different approach since a molding
lip rests in the rabbit, however, this design adversely affects styling and will not be
considered as a valid alternative in this analysis.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <b><p><em>4.3.1.3.&nbsp; Layer C</em></p>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the effort in the past several years has been concentrated in the area of
promoting motion. The directions considered were: variation of the contact point geometry,
lubrication and material selection.</p>

<p>A hinge design appears to be the only conceptual approach to prohibiting the motion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <b><p><em>4.3.1.4.&nbsp; Layer D</em></p>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>

<p></b>Various <strong>contact point geometry </strong>alternatives have been studied.
Macro level (stipple, pointed end, round end) or micro level (RIM - reaction injection
molding - provide rough surface; extruded provides smoother surface)</p>

<p><b>Lubrication</b> appears to be the most obvious and, therefore, the most considered
area. Prior attempts varied from expensive lubricants such as Krytox® to Attchison
Colloid, which are currently used by major molding suppliers. Also included in this
category is flocking. The weakness of lubrication is the robustness of application and
associated expense.</p>
<b>

<p>Molding material</b> variation was another area of study and experimentation. Soft
materials seem to perform better from the squeak point of view, but they are more
susceptible to flutter.</p>
<b>

<p>Hinge design</b> was initially implemented in the form of a two-piece molding design.
Later an attempt was made to come up with a single piece molding, which relied upon
flexing of the entire lip to accommodate for the motion. Either design is prominent to
flutter.</p>

<p><i>Now let's consider the Flutter/Buzz part of the Roadmap.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <b><p></i><em>4.3.1.5.&nbsp; Layer A</em><i></p>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p></i>It is known that Flutter/Buzz phenomenon is caused by Low Stability of the molding
lip. This effect is typically observed at ambient to warm temperature range, high speed
(above 55 mph) driving condition and a strong cross wind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <b><p><em>4.3.1.6.&nbsp; Layer B</em></p>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>

<p>Increase stability</b> is an obvious approach to resolve low stability problem.</p>

<p>Air<b> pressure build-up under the lip </b>was suspected to cause instability, which
resulted in several solutions. </p>

<p>Additionally, engineers have recognized the <b>temperature effect </b>concern (plastics
get softer at higher temperature and stiffer at lower temperatures), but we did not find
any attempts to temper this effect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <b><p><em>4.3.1.7.&nbsp; Layer C</em></p>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Increasing stability of the lip manifested itself in <b>increasing stiffness</b>.</p>
<b>

<p>Foam blocker</b> is the primary conceptual approach to reduce the pressure build-up
under the lip. Additionally, attempts have been made to<b> vent</b> (reduce) the pressure
in the cavity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <font size="2"><p></font><em><b>4.3.1.8.&nbsp; <a NAME="_Ref367177298">Layer D</a></b></em></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Increasing stiffness is suggested to be implemented by selecting stiffer material and
making the lip thicker (however, this will to make the squeak worse).</p>

<p>Foam blockers are used as a permanent solution where it is injected under the lip and
foamed in place or as a temporary solution where a 2 inch piece at the bottom of the
A-pillar was recently changed to a foam strip under the entire length of the A-pillar.
Needless to say this solution adds extra cost, and its long term durability is
questionable.</p>

<p>Two directions have been explored in the venting arena: venting to the roof and holes
in the molding. Both directions had appearance issues associated with them.</p>

    <b><p>5.3.1.&nbsp; Interim solution</p>
    </b>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The Vehicle Program Team developed and implemented an interim fix for the flutter
(buzz) issue. A foam blocker is installed in the rabbit (cavity between the molding and
the body sheet metal). This blocker prevents pressure build-up, and, thus, reduces the
lift force on the molding lip. Additionally, the molding cross section was made thicker
and the material changed to higher durometer. Since stiffer materials are known to promote
squeak, slip coat is applied to the under side of the molding to reduce the probability of
squeak.</p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="97dec5-7.gif" HSPACE="12" WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="218"> </p>

<p>As stated in the introduction, this team's goal was to develop solutions for <i>both</i>
squeak and flutter(buzz) <i>without</i> increasing manufacturing/assembly complexity and
labor or material cost.</p>

<p>In this section we will review newly developed solution concepts. Please refer to the
Roadmap B on the previous page and note that <b>the</b> <b>following solution concepts
address <i>both</i> squeak and flutter</b>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <b><p><a NAME="_Ref364734650"></a>5.3.2.&nbsp; <a NAME="_Toc366547477">Composite material</a></p>
    </b>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result of the structured approach undertaken by the team, a new <i>conceptual</i> <i>direction</i>
on how the squeak issue can be approached was revealed (Layer B, <i>Prevent sound wave
propagation</i> box in the center of the Roadmap). As discussed above (<i>Mechanisms of
squeak</i>, Page <a HREF="#_Ref364581976">*</a>), squeak is caused by
stick and slip phenomenon. This results in a formation of a wave traveling along the
molding lip. This wave can be related to the audible sound wave. It is suggested to use<i>
composite structure</i> (Layer C) of the lip to make the lip stiffer in the tangential

explored.</p>

<p>An important feature of the following concept is that one can choose PVC with low
durometer (soft), which is known to be less prone to squeak, and achieve required
stiffness by reinforcing the structure.</p>

<p>The concept of composite structure is a true TRIZ solution. In early 1950's the founder
of the TRIZ methodology, Henry Altshuler, developed the<i> Table of Contradictions. </i>The
use of composite materials was specified as one of the inventive principles applied to
resolve the contradiction of increasing strength while decreasing weight.</p>

<p>After viewing the high speed video film of squeak, the team concluded that the early
stages of squeak are characterized by formation of little 'bubbles' along the edge of the
lip. As the vibration input increases, the frequency of these 'bubbles' increases as well,
this results in motion across the entire lip edge.</p>

<p></b>The area of prohibiting motion at the edge of the molding lip has <i>not</i> been
explored sufficiently in the past. The underlying idea is that the motion occurring
between the edge of the molding and the body sheet metal (approximately 0.1 mm) can be
absorbed by the flexible structure of the molding. However, the contradiction to keep in
mind is that the molding cannot be soft due to a potential flutter problem.</p>

<p>The two designs, described below, have a stiff lip (anti-flutter measure) and
accommodate for relative motion with specific lip edge layout.</p>

<p>Both of these concepts also provide an edge that is more stable against bending in the
plane of the sheet metal, which will eliminate the condition for initiation of slip and
squeak.</p>

<p>Wheels are extensively used in various industries to translate sliding friction into
rolling. In the two concepts described below the wheel is used in a somewhat different

temperature and squeak increases at low temperature. To further decrease flutter and
squeak, the material pair can be selected so that the molding will be pressed to the sheet
metal stronger under warm (hot) temperature conditions and weaker under cool (cold)
temperature conditions. Should such pair of plastics be hard to find, the metal foil
discussed in the Paragraph 5.3.2.5 can be replaced with a bi-metallic foil with the
desirable temperature induced behavior.</p>

<p>The innovation methodologies TRIZ and SIT were used to structure this problem and
generate solution concepts. TRIZ is a Russian acronym for <i>Theory of Inventive Problem
Solving</i> and is the result of over forty-five years of research and development that
began in the former Soviet Union. Through this research, it was recognized that the same
fundamental problem or contradiction had been addressed by a number of inventions, but in
different areas of technology. In addition, it was discovered that the same fundamental
inventive principles and subsequent solutions were used over and over again, often
separated by many years. The research scientists sought to extract, compile and organize
this knowledge and reasoned that if the latter inventor had knowledge of the earlier
solutions, their task would have been straightforward. </p>

<p>TRIZ is a structured methodology for innovation, a methodical way of examining
inventive problems, exploring the solution space and developing conceptual solutions. It
is a <b>means of reaching across engineering disciplines to solve problems by using
solutions from other areas of technology and industry.</b> TRIZ generalizes worldwide
experience in invention, systemitizes successful methods of solving technological problems
and reveals regularities in the evolution of technological systems. This methodology is
gaining popularity in the industrial community as companies expand their engineering
competency from a corporate &quot;lessons learned&quot; knowledge base to a cross-industry
technology base. </p>

<p>SIT (Structured Inventive Thinking) is an extension of TRIZ, conceived in Israel by
TRIZ practitioners with the goal of making the TRIZ methodology more accessible and easier
to learn. The Ford Research Laboratory Physics Department is continuing to develop the SIT
methodology and has developed a training course for Ford engineers.</p>

<p>We have used a mixture of TRIZ and SIT methods on this problem. Both methodologies
share the following qualities and provide systematic, disciplined ways to:

</p><ol>
  <li>Translate a general problem, such as <i>molding squeak</i>, into a specific technical
    objective, such as <i>stiffen molding in direction X, while softening it in direction Y.</i>
  </li>
  <li>Solve the specific technical objective by using <i>general inventive principles</i> that
    are contained within the methodologies. These principles are drawn from many diverse
    engineering disciplines and provide engineers with solutions that are outside their areas
    of expertise.</li>
</ol>

<p>The advantages of these methodologies are that they focus the solution efforts on the
technical <i>root cause</i> or <i>causes</i> of the problem, and then provide the tools to
invent design solutions. The result is a variety of innovative solution concepts of which
several are useful, practical solutions to the problem.</p>

  <p><font SIZE="4"><i><b>6.2.&nbsp; <a NAME="_Toc366547505">Example: Derivation of 'Rolling
  Lip' Solution Concept</a></b></i></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>General Problem: The molding lip <b>must not squeak</b> when subjected to small scale
random oscillations against the painted body sheet metal and, additionally, the lip <b>must
not buzz</b> when presented with any high speed air flow situation likely to occur during
usage.</p>

<p>Experts on the squeak problem already knew that squeak was caused by the molding lip
edge transitioning between sticking and slipping against the sheet metal. Many attempts
had been made to keep the lip edge in a permanent <i>slip</i> mode, hence slip coat,
Krytox, etc., but few engineers had investigated methods of keeping the edge in the <i>stick
</i>condition. Since this branch of the solution tree was less developed, we focused
considerable effort here (see <i>Roadmap B</i>). </p>

<p>Existing test data had shown that the amount of relative motion occurring during slip
was surprisingly small. It was on the order of 0.1 mm. Thus, it appeared that if the
molding lip were <i>soft</i> enough, it should be able to accommodate this minute motion
without slipping. Test data showed that softer molding lips were less prone to squeak than
stiffer ones.</p>

<p>The experts on the buzz problem pointed out that as a molding lip becomes <i>stiffer</i>,
buzz problems are reduced or eliminated. The solution requirements of the two problems
seemed to conflict: The molding lip <u>must be stiff</u> to prevent buzz and it <u>must be
soft</u> to prevent squeak. Once the problem was properly formulated, the TRIZ software
yielded the problem statement: <i>Make the lip stiff in the lift-off direction to prevent
buzz, but soft in the tangential direction to prevent squeak.</i> This is a statement of a
specific technical objective. The next step was to create designs that satisfied this
condition.</p>

<p>One innovative principle is 'use rolling to counteract friction' by analogy to ball
bearings. We considered how the lip edge could be made to roll against the body. Rounded
lip edges had been tried before, however, the rounded edge was not provided with a hinge
to pivot on. We produced a rounded edge with a hinge. Tank tracks represent another type
of rolling contact, where a loop shaped track is used to enlarge the contact area. A
different design was conceived that made use of that analogy (see <i>Rolling Contact
Concepts </i>on page </font><a HREF="#_Ref364735764">*</a><font size="3">).</p>

<p>By providing a lip in <i>rolling contact</i> with the body, it should be possible to
make the lip <i>stiffer</i>, to prevent buzz, and at the same time make it <i>softer</i>
in the tangential direction, to prevent squeak. Rolling contact allows relative motion
without slipping.</font><font SIZE="2"></p>
