<p>The Input-Output Trimming Operator is one of the best instruments for stating the
correct problem, when we need to develop new concepts for existing machines, devices or
their components.</p>

<p>We can consider every machine as a chain of energy transformations from the Input to
Output ( According to TRIZ language we use the word &quot;field&quot; instead of
&quot;energy&quot;).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Let's take the usual mixer. We have here the next field transformation chain:</p>

<p>Electrical field (Input) --&gt; Electro-Magnetic field --&gt;Mechanical field of the
motor rotation--&gt;Mechanical field of the tool rotation--&gt; Mechanical field of the
mixture motion (Output).</p>

<p>According to I-O-T Operator we have to trim the chain and state the problem of the
right transformation of Input into Output without intermediate links.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>We want to transform the electrical energy (field) into components of mixture motion
without intermediate links.</p>

<p>Of course, we can trim only part of our chain instead of whole one. Then we have to
state the trimming problem for the Input and Output of this part instead of the whole
chain.</p>

<p>The next step is to find physical effect(s) that will solve the problem of transforming
this Input to this Output directly, and build new concept(s) to implement this
transformation. </p>

<p>For example for our mixer:

</p><ul>
  <li>The mixer could be built on the piezo-electric effect, or</li>
  <li>If we trim only part of the chain, we can use the electromagnetic vibrators</li>
  <li>The fantastic solution is to use electrical discharges in liquids, for example,
    electro-hydraulic hit. But it isn't so fantastic, in my opinion.</li>
</ul>

<p>So try it! Good Luck.</p>
