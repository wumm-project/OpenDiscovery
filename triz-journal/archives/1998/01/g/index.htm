<p>TRIZ was featured at the Product Development Management Association&#146;s conference
&quot;Bringing the Fuzzy Front End into Focus,&quot; December 15-17 in Scottsdale, AZ. The
&quot;Fuzzy Front End&quot; refers to the beginning of the development cycle, when new
product and service concepts are not clear, and many organizations are now at the
beginning of defining processes and systems to manage the &quot;fuzziness&quot; of the
front end of new product development cycle.</p>

<p>Abbie Griffin of the U. of Illinois gave an outstanding paper &quot;Technology and
Customer Needs&quot; that examined the interplay between needs that the customer
recognizes and possible technologies that the customer does not yet recognize as needs.
Christina Hepner Brodie of the Center for Quality Management did a joint presentation with
David Bennell of L.L. Bean Co. on understanding product needs from the customers&#146;
point of view, and translating those needs into product specifications. The audience was
particularly impressed with L.L.Bean&#146;s extensive network of testers for its outdoor
products, and the efforts of the design team to understand the testers&#146;
reactions&#151;even if it meant climbing the mountain with the testers, or getting into
the sleeping bag with them. </p>

<p>Preston Smith&#146;s presentation &quot;The Fuzzy Front End: the &#145;bargain
basement&#146; of cycle time opportunities&quot; was complementary to the marketing
presentations. His emphasis was on understanding your product development cycle, and
understanding the value of time&#151;knowing the actual impact on sales and profit of
introducing a product one month sooner, or with one additional feature, or with a lower
defect rate, etc. The rigor of his approach appealed to a large segment of the audience as
the way to create a common vocabulary of value for the product development process.</p>

<p>Conference organizer Patrick Brown of Lucent Technologies invited the TRIZ Institute to
participate, since he had been impressed by the systematic way that TRIZ explores the
possibilities for product and process development. The TRIZ presentation was a panel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ellen Domb, co-editor, The TRIZ Journal</p>
  <p>Lee Petersen, Manager, Melroe Co., Ingersoll-Rand </p>
  <p>James Kowalick, co-editor of The TRIZ Journal and VP of BioFutures, Inc.</p>
  <p>Gernot Mueller, President of BioFutures, Inc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We presented a brief overview of TRIZ (in the audience of 200 product development
professionals, only about 10% were familiar with TRIZ!) and showed how it had been used in
the two very different corporate environments. BioFutures, Inc. is a biotechnology
start-up venture, using TRIZ technology forecasting methods to create new concepts for
trans-dermal drug delivery. (See the article by Drs. Mueller and Kowalick in the December,
1997 issue of The TRIZ Journal.) Melroe Co., by contrast, makes heavy equipment, and is
most famous for the Bobcat line of skid-steer machines, that are used for construction,
agriculture, mining, warehousing, and other activities that require versatility and
durability. Lee Petersen showed how TRIZ problem solving had been used to simplify many
aspects of Bobcat construction, and talked about how TRIZ is being introduced for
technology forecasting. </p>

<p>Audience questions focused on the issues of how to integrate the possible with the
probable and how to predict market success, not just technology success. The systematic
nature of TRIZ seemed to have universal appeal to people who wrestle with the
&quot;fuzziness&quot; of product development.</p>
