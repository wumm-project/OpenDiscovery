<p>Introduction</font><i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ</i></b> is the Russian acronym for <i><b>The Theory of Inventive
Problem Solving</b></i>. TRIZ is a unique knowledge-based technology for accelerated
development of design concepts. The power of TRIZ is based on the understanding of the
evolution of successful products, ways to overcome psychological barriers, and
generalization of the ways used to solve problems in the most innovative inventions. TRIZ
can guide you in analyzing your product&#146;s or process&#146;s functions in order to
best use its resources and identify the best opportunities for its development.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accelerated product development has become increasingly important. You
need to develop successful new generations of products while shortening development cycles
and reducing project spending. Implementing the TRIZ methodology from the beginning of
your project can save you much time and effort in your search for the ideal solutions. In
problem-solving, TRIZ systematically analyzes the problem as an innovative situation and
applies a series of guidelines to generate solution alternatives. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contradictions, or conflicts, represent the most difficult type of
problem during product development. In many cases a desired improvement can cause a
deterioration in another area. For example, very often an attempt to increase productivity
causes deterioration in quality. As a result, a trade-off situation is created.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The TRIZ methodology includes algorithms for resolving conflicts
between product parameters while minimizing product changes and costs, leading to
breakthrough solutions. As an example, consider the following case study of a difficult
problem.</p>
<font SIZE="4"><b>

<p>Initial Situation</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A hard drive has an actuator arm, which can move relative to a magnetic
disk that is rotated by an electric motor. At the end of the arm is a read/write head,
which can magnetize or sense the magnetic field of the disk. The head is separated from
the surface of the disk by airflow generated by the rotating disk. The gap between the
head and the disk is very small. Any contact between the head and the magnetic disk may
cause loss of data.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The disk has a landing zone, where the head is positioned when the disk
is not spinning. The landing zone is an area of the disk where no data is stored. When the
computer is switched on, the disk starts spinning, creating an airflow, which lifts the
arm, creating the required gap. Then the arm is moved away from the landing zone to read
and write data. When the computer is turned off, the arm is returned to the landing zone.
Slowing of the spinning disk decreases the airflow supporting the arm. As a result, the
arm rests on the landing zone.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Applying an external force to the drive (such as moving or knocking the
computer), can move the head away from the landing zone and destroy data on the disk. A
latching mechanism is used to prevent the arm from moving when the computer is not in use.
A permanent magnet holds the arm when the head is in the landing zone. When the computer
is turned on, the arm has to overcome the latch magnet in order to move.</p>

Hard drive</p>
<font SIZE="4"><b>

<p>Problem</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The drive needs to be protected against stronger external force. This
could be achieved by replacing the current latch magnet with a stronger one. But the arm
would not be able to overcome the force of any magnet stronger then the current one. Thus
an attempt to improve the reliability of the hard drive causes deterioration of its
performance.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A breakthrough solution is needed to improve the reliability of the
drive without any deterioration of its performance, while minimizing any increase in
production costs.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE="4">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary of Application of TRIZ</font></p>

<p>Functional Analysis</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The latching mechanism includes the latch magnet, a plastic holder for
the latching magnet, and a screw.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The function of the latch magnet is to hold the arm.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The performance of the latch magnet is insufficient according to the
requirements for a new design.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A stronger latch magnet will hold the arm adequately, but the arm will
not be released.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Model of the conflict:</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="center"><img SRC="Image68.gif" border="0" WIDTH="526" HEIGHT="119"></b></p>
<b>

<p>Application of Ideal Ways</b><i></p>

<p>Ideal Ways</i> is an analytical TRIZ method developed by Zinovy Royzen. The method is
an advanced development of Altshuller&#146;s concept of Ideal System Ideal Ways comprise
the best directions for improvement of a product.</p>
<b>

<p>Ideal Way 1. Eliminate the need for holding the arm.</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The arm has to be held in order to prevent it from moving while the
computer is not in use. If the arm cannot be moved by the external force, there is no need
for holding the arm. This statement requires a description of the chain of unwanted
actions that causes the unwanted motion of the arm.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unwanted action: The arm is moved by its pin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problem: The motion of the pin caused by an external force has to be
  eliminated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unwanted action: The pin is moved by the drive case.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problem: The motion of the case caused by an external force has to be
  eliminated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unwanted action: The drive case is moved by the computer chassis.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problem: The motion of the chassis caused by an external force has to
  be eliminated.</p>
  <i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ Standard Technique</i> (direct ways to eliminate an unwanted
  action) was applied to solve some of the formulated problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<b>

<p>Ideal Way 2. Substitute the latch magnet.</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The list of resources includes resources of the latching mechanism, the
drive, and the surroundings. Analysis of the resources revealed the possibility of
substituting for the latch magnet.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One possibility: The arm carries a voice coil. Interaction between the
magnetic field created by an electric current through the voice coil and the magnetic
field of the voice coil magnets swings the arm around the pin. The latch arm could be
substituted with a much stronger voice coil magnet. In this case, there would be no need
for the latch magnet, its plastic holder, and the screw. In mass production of the hard
drives, the solution could save a lot of money for the manufacturer.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another possibility: The external force itself could be used to hold
the arm instead of the latch magnet. The solution looks like a &quot;safety belt&quot; for
the arm.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The requirement to consider alternative ways to hold the arm lead to
analysis of a variety of locking mechanisms used in different industries.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ideal Way 3. The arm held by a stronger magnet has to be released when
necessary.</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We already described the conflict caused by an attempt to make the
latch magnet stronger. The <i>Algorithm for Inventive Problem Solving</i> (ARIZ), the main
TRIZ method for solving conflicts, was applied to solve the formulated conflict.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through the step-by-step application of ARIZ, the model of the problem
was formulated, then the physical contradiction of the conflict, then the ideal final
result.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After application of the <i>Physical Contradiction Separation
Techniques</i> and utilization of the resources of the latching mechanism and the hard
drive, a number of design concepts were developed. Any of the developed concepts allow
significant increase of the holding force without any deterioration of the performance of
the arm.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All developed design concepts were evaluated. The concepts are the set
of mutually exclusive but collectively exhaustive best possible improvements. This set is
the basis for both short-term and long-term planning of innovation.</p>
<font SIZE="4"><b>

<p>Conclusion</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TRIZ is a logical, knowledge-based technology for conceptual design.
Guided by TRIZ, users not only overcome psychological inertia and preconceived notions,
they also have the opportunity to analyze the best directions for improvement of products.
TRIZ methods help TRIZ users to maximize utilization of the resources of a system to meet
objectives of new product development projects with less cost and without any unwanted
effects.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Engineers, researchers, and managers involved in product development
can rely on TRIZ to avoid a failure and trade-off concept.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Application of TRIZ accelerates the search for breakthrough solutions
and gives users the ability to reach far greater levels of product performance. TRIZ users
have demonstrated a strategic advantage in new product development.</p>
