<p ALIGN="CENTER">PROLOGUE</p>

<p>This column is the first in a series that will attempt to address issues relevant to
the position of the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) in society today and in the
encroaching 21<sup>st</sup> century. My journey to TRIZ understanding will be discussed so
that a &quot;roadmap&quot; may be presented that will light the path others may follow as
well as outline the current status of the theory. It will be important during this journey
to often remember the motto and phrase of The Royal Society of London (1660): <i>Nullius
in Verba</i>, meaning &quot;No man&#146;s word shall be final.&quot; These columns will
discuss the issues that hindered my progress, at the personal and corporate level, as well
as resistance encountered along the way exerted by the existing scientific paradigm [ref
1][ref 2][ref 3][ref 4]. </p>

<p>This resistance to change, the current paradigm, must be understood if it is to be
defeated. In order to increase our understanding of paradigms some discourse on this topic
is necessary. Thomas Kuhn states in his thesis [ref 5] that every scientist (or engineer),
just like the rest of humanity, carries out their day-to-day affairs within a framework of
presuppositions about what constitutes a problem, a solution, and a method. [ref 6] Such a
background comprises a paradigm, and at any given time a particular scientific community
will have a prevailing paradigm that shapes and directs work in the field. Kuhn further
claims that scientific revolutions involve bloodshed on the same order of magnitude as
that commonly seen in political revolutions, the only difference being that the blood is
now intellectual rather than liquid - but no less real. [ref 7] (The author believes any
doubts concerning the necessity of a revolution to introduce TRIZ to the scientific field
will be removed during the subsequent lectures.) It is this type of resistance that I
believe plagues the corporate body as cancer does a human body (pervading and multiplying
to its&#146; own demise).</p>

<p>Kuhn delineates a Fivefold Way for characterizing the features of a good theory:</p>
<i>

<p>Accurate: </i>Consequences of the theory should be in agreement with the experiment.</p>
<i>

<p>Consistent: </i>The theory should contain no internal contradictions and, moreover, it
should be consistent with currently accepted theories applicable to related aspects of
Nature.</p>
<i>

<p>Broad: </i>The scope of the theory&#146;s consequences should extend beyond the
particular observations, laws, or subtheories that it was created to explain.</p>
<i>

<p>Simple: </i>It should bring order to phenomenon that without it would be individually
isolated.</p>
<i>

<p>Fruitful: </i>The theory should disclose new phenomena or previously unobserved
relationships.,<sup><a href="#1">1</a> <a href="#2">2</a></sup> [ref 8]</p>

<p>I will discuss these points along the journey as they served as signposts that helped
me take the right turns (or left turns as the case may be) to my current reality, which is
not perfect but has allowed me function as a very successful TRIZ consultant and TRIZ
educator (undergraduate and graduate levels). Personal resistance was experienced along my
path and these episodes will be relayed and diagnosed so that my travails may be avoided
by future pathfinders. [ref 9] Presuppositions concerning personal ability also interfere
with the integration (or even the acceptance) of a new methodology into your set of skills
applicable to your daily duties. This was evidenced in my own life as well as many others
I am aware of. [ref 10] This column will address philosophical aspects of TRIZ as well as
relate a &quot;state of the art&quot; analysis indicating what must happen to relegate
this science to the same level of mathematics. <sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>I will address the information I learned and the many associated aspects pertinent to
the evaluation of information processing: the Hermeneutic Principles for Learning.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> These Principles are roughly as follows: (1) who wrote it and what
data is it based on, (2) why was it written, (3) when was it written, (4) who was it
written to, (5) what where the prevailing customs influencing the author, and (6) what was
the intent in the original language. The knowledge I amassed will be discussed in these
terms and the integration of each pieces will be discussed with regards to the whole.</p>

<p>Three times in the past theoretical astronomers have invented a new planet on the basis
of indirect and circumstantial evidence. The first time was in 1845 when Adams and
Leverrier independently deduced the existence of the planet Neptune from the perturbations
which it had produced in the motion of Uranus. One year later, Neptune was discovered in
the predicted region of sky. The second prediction of a new planet was in 1859 when the
same Leverrier deduced that perturbations in Mercury&#146;s orbit could be explained by
the existence of one or more planets circling the Sun inside the orbit of Mercury. The
name Vulcan was given to the hypothesized planet. In 1915 Einstein showed these deviations
as a consequence of general relativity without any help from Vulcan. The third prediction
of a planet was also in 1915, when Lowell deduced from residual perturbations of Uranus
the existence of another planet beyond Neptune. This time Pluto was found, but possessing
a mass too small to account for the observed perturbations. This discovery then was by
accident. Adding up the score, we may say that out of the three theoretical predictions of
new planets, one turned out right, one turned out wrong, and one turned out to be a fluke.
I consider the value of the theory under discussion to be analogous to the theoretical
predictions of the three new planets discussed previously. Let us call this planet
Innovation,<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> in the universe of Observed Reality. It remains
to be seen if this planet exists, if it does not, or if we have stumbled upon something
greater, by accident. [ref 11][ref 12]</p>

<p>Emil Wiechert, speaking to the Physics and Economics Society of Koernigsberg in East
Prussia in 1896, said the following: &quot;&#133;The matter which we suppose to be the
main constituent of the universe is built out of small self-contained building-blocks, the
chemical atoms. It cannot be repeated too often that the word &quot;atom&quot; is nowadays
detached from any of the old philosophical speculations: we know precisely that the atoms
with which we are dealing are in no sense the simplest conceivable components of the
universe&#133;. We have to abandon completely the idea that by going into the realm of the
small we shall reach the ultimate foundations of the universe&#133;. I believe we can
abandon this idea without any regret. The universe is infinite in all
directions&#133;.&quot; [ref 13] I believe these words to be pertinent with regard to our
tasks at hand as they parallel my belief that our current understanding of creativity and
innovation is only a precursory knowledge that is a gateway to a more beautiful algorithm
for innovation. We must not allow ourselves to believe that we have understood Innovation
and Creativity in the fullest, but consider it a challenge to increase the boundaries, as
truly the universe <i>is </i>infinite in all directions&#133;&#133;</p>

<p>In 1995 I read a short article in <u>NASA Tech Briefs</u> that referred to a Russian
methodology for pooling patents generated throughout the entire country. This patent fund
was then made available to engineers and scientists as well as certain principles that
comprised the fundamental paths to solution embodied in this patent fund. It was not
evident at the time of reading but it is clear now that this was a veiled reference to
TRIZ. This brief article stimulated much curiosity and I requested further information
from NASA. There was no further information provided. I thought about this article for
several months with an increasing desire to find out what this was all about. During this
time period I was a Staff Scientist for a major space and defense firm. My primary
responsibilities were research, development, and problem solving. I was very successful
and productive and this would later impede my personal acceptance of TRIZ as I had
developed methods for solving problems and being creative. There was my own paradigm for
accomplishing tasks that would interfere. I eventually, in May of 1997, discussed this
article with the director of the space and defense group, my direct superior, and he had
heard of this method previously as well. He had also received an advertisement from a
company that produced software and conducted training relevant to the article in question.
This was the major breakthrough necessary for the beginning of my TRIZ education. The
document was an announcement for training from Invention Machine Corporation (IMC). IMC
was offering a software package called IMLab 2.11 and this appeared to be similar to what
the <u>NASA Tech Briefs</u> article was referring to. We purchased a copy of the software
and I registered to attend training. I attended the training in July of 1997 and became
aware of the IMC product TechOptimizer. TechOptimizer included the IMLab software that we
had purchased but also included some modules akin to value engineering (function
modeling). References to the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving were made during this
course and major works were cited. [ref 14][ref 15] I obtained copies of these works and
studied them. I also attended the 3<sup>rd</sup> Annual Total Product Development
Symposium in Dearborn, Michigan, in November of 1997. [ref 16] References 14-16, the IMC
training, and the vast amount of information I learned from the symposium will be
discussed in detail in PART II of this column. The next column will comprise my first real
understanding of the underlying principles of TRIZ.</p>
