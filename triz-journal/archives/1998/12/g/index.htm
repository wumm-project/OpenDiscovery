<p>There are many definitions of quality, and there are many definitions of creativity/
innovation. The two leading philosophers of quality agree that management and workers both
must exercise great creativity to achieve the goals of quality improvement.</p>

<p>In <i><b>The New Economics</b></i> (ref.1) W. Edwards Deming said

</p><ul>
  <li>&quot;What is quality? A product of a service possesses quality if it helps somebody and
    enjoys a good and sustainable market. Trade depends on quality.&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;Is it sufficient to have happy customers? Loyal Customers? The customer expects
    only what the producer has led him to expect. He is a rapid learner.&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;It is good to introduce, by innovation a new product that will do the job better.
    But where does innovation come from?&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>In <i><b>A History of Managing for Quality </b></i>(ref. 2) J.M.Juran said

</p><ul>
  <i>
  <li>&quot;Quality Improvement: </i>This concept is new as applied to the workforce. It began
    in 1962 when the Japanese invented Quality Circles as a means of enabling workers to make
    improvements (in quality and otherwise) within their own departments. &#133;These circles
    have been stunningly successful&#133;and have been widely copied in many other
    countries.&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;Self-directing teams have been the most impressive&#133;significant improvements
    in quality and productivity&#133;accompanied by as sharp drop in the ratio of supervisors
    to workers.&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;The concept of Strategic Quality Planning: The business plan is enlarged to
    include goals for quality. These goals are &#145;deployed&#146; to lower levels to
    determine the resources needed, agree on the actions to be taken, &#133;.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>In the US, the use of the Baldrige Award Criteria (ref. 3) has expanded greatly, with
37 state and regional awards, as well as the national award. More than 2 million copies of
the award criteria have been distributed to businesses, government organizations, and
health and education organizations. The European Quality Award has had similar popularity.
The Baldrige Criteria in each area follow approximately the same pattern:

</p><ol>
  <li>This is a good thing. How does your organization do it?</li>
  <li>How do you improve what you do?</li>
  <li>Do you compare yourself to other organizations? If yes, how do you select them and what
    do you do with what you learn?</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a very specific version of the general pattern of quality improvement shown in
Figure 1, in general, and in Figure 2 in more detail.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In each area of the Baldrige Award, organizations need to exercise creativity in order
to tailor the concepts to their own industry and culture. See Table 1.</p>

  each area. </p>

<p>In many quality improvement training programs, the emphasis on creativity has been
based on an egalitarian assumption that if the people involved in some specific area of
work apply their knowledge of the work and their knowledge of their customers to the
improvement of that work, they will be a success. But, as Dr. Deming has taught us, the
workers (whether mangers or non-management employees) must be given training to do the
work they are asked to do. For many quality improvement activities, the only training in
creativity has been training in brainstorming.</p>

<p>Brainstorming is a method of creativity that was developed initially for liberating
people from their disciplined way of thinking, to get them to look far-afield from
conventional thinking, and was originally used in the advertising industry. (ref. 4)
Brainstorming is a right brain activity; that is, it works best if the brainstorming team
uses the skills of the right side of their brains. The right and left sides of the brain,
for most people, have the characteristics shown in Table 2. </p>

  <p>Table 2. Different patterns of thinking for the right and left sides of the brain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why the &quot;rules of brainstorming&quot; (ref. 5) advise participants to draw
pictures, to post all ideas on a wall, to generate ideas continuously, not to criticize or
praise another person&#146;s ideas (since praise and criticism are both judgments, and
will surpress the right brain activity in favor of left brain activity.) and to encourage
continuous flow of ideas. At the end of the brainstorming session ideas are sorted,
duplicates are removed, and criteria for the kind of ideas that can improve the process
under consideration (nominal group technique, prioritization matrix, prototype studies)
are applied. If there are many ideas, the affinity diagram is frequently used to look for
patterns in the ideas and to consolidate the categories of ideas so action can be planned.
If there are relationships between the ideas that have not been articulated, the
interrelationship digraph can be used to bring out the patterns (ref. 5)</p>

<p>Extensions of brainstorming include brainwriting, imaginary brainstorming, mind
mapping, and word/picture analogy development (ref.4). All of these techniques enhance the
quality improvement effort by involving all the members of a team in creating the ideas
for improving their work, and all these methods apply at many levels throughout the
organization, from strategic planning by the executive team to process improvement in a
quality circle, to health and safety improvement for all employees.</p>

<p>The introduction of TRIZ in the last decade has given us a left-brain creativity tool
to use for creative problem solving when the right brain tools are not adequate, or not
appropriate(ref 6.) &quot;TIPS&quot; is the acronym for &quot;Theory of Inventive Problem
Solving,&quot; and &quot;TRIZ&quot; is the acronym for the same phrase in Russian. TRIZ
was developed by Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues (Ref. 6-10) in the former USSR
starting in 1946, and is now being developed and practiced throughout the world. (Ref.11).</p>

<p>TRIZ research began with the hypothesis that there are universal principles of
invention that are the basis for creative innovations that advance technology, and that if
these principles could be identified and codified, they could be taught to people to make
the process of invention more predictable. The research has proceeded in several stages
over the last 50 years. Over 2 million patents have been examined, classified by level of
inventiveness, and analyzed to look for principles of innovation. The three primary
findings of this research are as follows:

</p><ol>
  <li><b>Problems and solutions were repeated across industries and sciences </b></li>
  <li><b>Patterns of technical evolution were repeated across industries and sciences</b></li>
  <li><b>Innovations used scientific effects outside the field where they were developed </b></li>
</ol>

<p>All three of these findings are applied throughout the quality improvement process, to
improve products, services, and the quality of management. These findings have been
embodied in a variety of TRIZ tools, which are used in many different ways . The
best-known tool is the 40 Principles of Problem Solving, and the accompanying
contradiction matrix. The following example shows how the TRIZ method can help all members
of an organization contribute to improvement of products, process, and services:</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Example: The Automobile Airbag: </p>
<b>

<p>Technical contradictions</b> are the classical engineering &quot;trade-offs.&quot; The
desired state can&#146;t be reached because something else in the system prevents it. In
other words, when something gets better, something else gets worse. Air bag examples of
technical contradictions are found in the technology and in the social problems that
surround the entire passenger protection situation. Examples:

</p><ul>
  <li>If the threshold for deployment is set low, protecting belted occupants, more unbelted
    small people in the passenger seat are injured.</li>
  <li>If the threshold for deployment is set high, unbelted passengers are protected from air
    bag-caused injury, but belted passengers suffer more injury from the collision.</li>
  <li>High power (&quot;aggressive&quot;) deployment saves lives of average-sized drivers, but
    increases injuries to unbelted or small passengers.</li>
  <li>Adding more sensors (and data processing) to customize the deployment to the
    circumstances, and thereby save lives of small and unbelted people, increases the
    complexity of the system.</li>
  <li>Adding more sensors (and data processing) to customize the deployment to the
    circumstances, and thereby save lives of small and unbelted people, decreases the
    reliability of the system.</li>
</ul>
<b>

<p>Resolving Technical Contradictions:</b></p>

<p>The TRIZ patent research classified 39 features for technical contradictions. Once a
contradiction is expressed in the <i>technical contradiction</i> form (the trade-off) the
next step is locate the features in the Contradiction Matrix. See the July, 1977 TRIZ
Journal for the complete matrix, and see Figure 3, below, for an extract.</p>

<p>Find the row that most closely matches the feature or parameter you are improving in
your &quot;trade-off&quot; and the column that most closely matches the feature or
parameter that degrades. The cell at the intersection of that row and column will have
several numbers. These are the identifying numbers for the Principles of Invention that
are most likely, based on the TRIZ research, to solve the problem: that is, to lead to a <i><b>breakthrough</b></i>
solution instead of a trade-off.</p>

<blockquote>

  cell refer to the principles that have the highest probability of resolving the
  contradiction The circled cell is discussed in the example in the text.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, consider the proposal to change the speed of inflation of the air bag, to
reduce injuries to small occupants. The trade-off is that injuries in high speed accidents
increase. Translating this into the TRIZ matrix terms, the parameter that improves is
&quot;Duration of action of a moving object&quot; (Row 15) and the parameter that worsens
is &quot;Object-generated harmful effects&quot; (Column 31). The cell at the intersection
has the notation &quot;21,39,16,22&quot; which are the identifiers for four of the
Principles of Invention. The first 2 are listed below, with airbag interpretations marked

        equivalent of an &quot;inert&quot; material&#151;it does not prevent the original purpose
        (inflate the bag and protect the person from hitting solid objects) but it cushions the
        blow from the bag itself. How can this be implemented? Change the structure of the
        bag&#151;make it corrugated, or make it of filaments, or use multiple crushable layers.
        Change the &quot;hardness&quot; without changing the structure (this is the 2-stage

<p>Likewise, the other tools of TRIZ can be used in a straightforward way to improve
products, services, systems, and to predict the improvements needed. One powerful
technique for understanding customer needs and carrying them into production is Quality
Function Deployment, QFD. The relationship between the tools of TRIZ and the tools of QFD
are as shown in Fig. 4 (derived from ref. 6)</p>
<b>

<p></b><img src="image92.jpg" alt="image92.jpg (71301 bytes)" WIDTH="700" HEIGHT="359"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Figure 4.<b> </b>&quot;X&quot; indicates common use of TRIZ techniques to solve
  problems that occur during the indicated stage of QFD. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>QFD is used in the Strategic Planning, Product Development, and Process Improvement
phases of quality improvement, and is frequently use in the Information and Analysis
phase, when internal information users are considered as customers. TRIZ can be used with
QFD or by itself, to improve an organization&#146;s problem-solving and technology
forecasting capability in all areas of quality improvement.</p>

<p>A similar table can be constructed for all the areas of the Baldrige Criteria, as
follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>

<p>Creativity improvement enhances quality improvement. Quality analysis tells us what our
customers want, what our processes need, and what our employees need, but creativity is
needed to find ways to make these new products, services, systems, and processes happen.</p>

<p>All employees can learn both right-brain and left-brain creativity methods, and can
learn to apply them to the appropriate situations. </p>
