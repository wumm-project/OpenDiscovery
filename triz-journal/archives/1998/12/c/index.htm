<p>Abstract</b> </p>

<p>What Genrich Altshuller did for inventive problem solving, Bill Mollison of Tasmania
did for sustainable agriculture. Central to the philosophy and methodology of
Mollison&#146;s Permaculture is the concept of using existing resources. Several resources
satisfy each need of a community and each resource satisfies several different needs. More
complete applications create mini-ecological systems. The created systems are integrated
in such a way that harmful effects from one element of the system become benefits for
another element of the system. </p>

<p>For example, the chicken is a recognized source for eggs and meat, but can also help
with six other homestead needs. In an well-integrated system design, body heat, carbon
dioxide and feather dust become resources for increased plant growth in the greenhouse.
The chicken is also a source of fertilizer (manure), weed control and insect control for
the small group of dwarf fruit trees. The chickens benefit from both the protection and
oxygen provided by having the hen house as part of the greenhouse. Being allowed
free-range of the orchard provides additional health benefits to the chickens, as well as
food and shade.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It should be noted that this approach is not limited to agriculture, but is also used
for urban/community design.</p>

<p>The use of resources and effects is central to Altshuller's concept of ideal design.
However, missing from the Permaculture methodology is a systematic method for innovation,
as well as the identification of design evolution patterns &#133; and these two elements
are the heart and soul of TRIZ. This paper presents an application of TRIZ for an existing
Permaculture-designed homestead that recently experienced a weakness in its design.
Several Permaculture concepts are included to demonstrate where the methodology offers a
mind set similar to that of the TRIZ practitioner. In both methodologies, analogic
thinking is the foundation to problem solving.</p>

<b>

<p>Introduction</b></p>

<p>Twenty years ago, the Permaculture approach was applied to accommodate needs of a
family of five. This design for an integrated homestead revolved around the multiple
resources provided by sheep. However, the family needs have changed over time, and also,
possibly, the weather patterns. The spring of 1998 had unusually warm during March and
April. Plant growth was early and healthy.</p>

<p>A rule of thumb for the New Hampshire farmer is to plan for a killing frost as late as
June 10th. Some farmers play the odds, winning some years and losing other years. The
farmer has some control over the planting of annuals, but light and temperature changes
caused by the weather and season trigger trees, bushes and perennials. On April 13, 1998,
after the unseasonably warm weather, there was a leaf-killing frost for plants such as
asparagus, sun chokes, plums, apples, heart nuts, mulberries and lilacs. These are all
plants that normally have no leaves at this time. </p>

<p>The question is: Can TRIZ, Permaculture and the ancient wisdom of the Andes be used to
reduce the consequences of a frost in future years? What is needed is a more robust design
for the food growing system of our homestead.</p>

<p>By identifying five levels of inventiveness for problem solving, Altshuller instructs
us to select the tools of TRIZ in the order of their increasing power. Unfortunately, we
have no way of predicting the necessary level of inventiveness required to solve a given
problem, for it is only after a problem has been solved that the level can be estimated.
If after a problem concept has been found it is discovered that a level one solution was
all that was required, then TRIZ was not necessary. Similarly, if clearly defining the
problem adequately provides acceptable solution concepts, then no further effort is
required.</p>

<p>A set of criteria must be used to decide when to stop searching for additional solution
concepts and when more powerful tools must be used to identify additional concepts. In
Gasanov, et al., the authors state that:

</p><ul>
  <li>Level 2 solutions can be found by using the 40 technical and the physical separation
    principles. </li>
  <li>Level 3 solutions require Su-field modeling and the 76 Standard Solutions.</li>
  <li>Level 4 solutions require ARIZ.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sane approach is to progressively use more powerful tools, stopping when
pre-selected criteria have been satisfied.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>The Integrated House </b></p>

<p>The following example describes a home that used permaculture design methods to
effectively integrate available resources. Several resources and concepts are integrated
into this design, which offers nice examples of TRIZ through both Ideality and the
utilization of system and super-system resources.</p>

<p>The design utilized the water cycle. The structure, intended for two people, was very
modest in size. The living space was orientated with a southern exposure, with the
greenhouse located on the southern side of the house and a cooler located on the northern
side of the house.</p>

<p>During the winter months, snow from the roof dropped into a small room (the
refrigerator) via a trap door. The door was kept open during cold weather and the room
filled to its ceiling. In the living quarters, a hole was cut in one wall to provide
access to a food storage bin within the large block of snow. The volume of snow was
sufficient to cool the food during the warmer months.</p>

<p>The snow room had holes in the floor for the melted snow to drip into a fishpond
filling the cellar. The fishpond also extended under the greenhouse, where rope was used
to wick water to the soil to maintain an ideal moisture level for the plants. Temperature
and sunlight were controlled by the opening and closing of blinds, which were controlled
by a freon phase-change (designed before freon was publicly know as a hazard to the ozone
layer).</p>

<p>At the back (north side) of the greenhouse, black containers filled with water were
used for heat storage. The containers stored heat from the warm daytime temperatures in
the greenhouse, and also from both conduction and radiation of heat from a wood stove in
the living quarters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>The Integrated Garden</b></p>

<p>The garden plot used the resources of companion planting for plant enhancement and
insect control. Mulch was used for weed and moisture control. The companion planting and
mulch together provided satisfactory results except for two insect infestations and this
year&#146;s damaging spring frost.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>The Problem for TRIZ</b></p>

<p>Trees (not TRIZ) and plants are damaged by below freezing weather after the leaf buds
have opened. The primary useful function for the garden is rapid and productive plant
growth. The primary harmful function is the death of new growth. The traditional way of
preventing frost damage is to irrigate with a fine water spray over the plant and trees.
The thin layer of ice that forms provides insulation to the leaves when they need it most.
However, the TRIZ team was concerned with a small homestead and not a commercial venture.
On the homestead labor intensive concepts may be acceptable, though the ideal design
should require no effort!</p>

<p>Problem Modeling

</p><ul>
  </b>
  <li>A model created by linking events can be used to establish an exhaustive set of problem
    statements. The identified links fall into four categories: provides a desired event,</li>
  <li>hinders a desired event,</li>
  <li>causes an undesired event,</li>
  <li>eliminates, reduces or prevents an undesired event.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, <i>Sun down</i> <b>causes </b><i>Lower air temperature. </i>This is an
undesirable effect, which is indicated by the shaded box. The irregular line indicates the
causal relationship.</p>

<p>Each node will yield at least two problem statements. These problem statements are
generated by an understanding of the opportunities for improvements that are present in
the relationship between any two events.</p>

<p>Six problem statements are associated with the node <i>Lower air temperature</i>. The
problem statements and concepts stimulated by the problem statement are:

</p><ol>
  <li>Find an alternative way to obtain [the] (<i>Increase in ground temperature</i>), that
    eliminates, reduces or prevents [the] (<i>Lower air temperature</i>), and does not require
    [the] (<i>Sun up</i>). This way should not be influenced by [the] (<i>Decrease in ground
    temperature</i>). </li>
  <i><p>Concept: place a sheet of plastic over trees and have a light bulb a little higher
  than the bottom of the plastic</i>.</p>
  <li>Find a way to do without [the] (<i>Increase in ground temperature</i>) for elimination,
    reduction or prevention of [the] (<i>Lower air temperature</i>).</li>
</ol>

<p>From this second problem statement are generated the following: <i>Concept: smoke pots,
warm water canals, drain cold air to a lower elevation, move warm air from lower pond,
divert moving water from above the pond to plant area.</i></p>

<p>One location is next to a small river that flows year round. During the spring, there
is plenty of water for developing a canal system such as those several hundred years ago
in the Andes Mountains of South America. One Andean system has parallel canals less than a
meter wide and three or four meters apart. The rising cloud caused by the low dew point
creates a huge surface area releasing sufficient energy to keep the air near the plants
above freezing. This also provides a super-effect of lengthening the growing season. This
system would work well in New Hampshire in the spring, but would be risky in the fall
because the water flow was unreliable.

<ol START="3">
  <li>Find an alternative way to obtain [the] (<i>Sun down</i>), that does not cause [the] (<i>Lower
    air temperature</i>).</li>
</ol>
<i>

<p>Concept: retractable insulation.</i>

<ol START="4">
  <li>Find a way to increase the effectiveness of eliminating [the] (<i>Lower air temperature</i>)
    by using [the] (<i>Increase in ground temperature</i>).</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>Concept: raise the ground temperature higher by adding heat sinks trapping day
  sunlight. Place fresh manure between the trunk and the drip line. Water poured on the pile
  will stimulate decomposition and heat transfer.</p>
  </i>
</blockquote>

<ol START="5">
  <li>Find an alternative way to eliminate, reduce or prevent [the] (<i>Lower air temperature</i>).</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>Concept: greenhouse.</p>
  </i>
</blockquote>

<p>Masamobu Fukaoka, the author of One Straw Revolution, offered the ultimate solution<i>:</i>
Move to a warmer climate. Actually, the answer was like a Zen master would offer when he
said, &quot;The first mistake of mankind was to wear clothes.&quot; Moving is always a
possibility, but frost damage is a periodic problem as far south as Florida.

<ol START="6">
  <li>Find a way to eliminate, reduce or prevent [the] (<i>Decrease in ground temperature</i>),
    under the condition of [the] (<i>Lower air temperature</i>).</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>Concept: insulate.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having generated a number of broad concepts, the engineering and feasibility of each
concept must be considered. For instance, if water canals are used, the rate of flow and
surface area must be determined for different slopes and areas.</p>

<p>There are 32 problem statements generated by all the functions in Figure 1. The
complete list is given at the end of the paper. Ideation International's IWB software was
used to generate this list. The concepts generated by looking at these problem statements
fell into three major areas:

</p><ul>
  <li>out of our scope (increasing the length of a day)</li>
  <li>immediate solutions (cover the plants)</li>
  <li>long-range solutions (increasing storage capacity by using phase changes or building
    canals or genetic engineering to increase the plant's resistance to frost).</li>
</ul>

<p>The concept of using solar reflectors came from the problem statement:</p>

<p>Find a way to enhance [the] (<i>Sun up</i>).</p>

<p>Any and all combinations of the generated (and yet-to-be generated) concepts offer
possible solutions. Some concepts are already used in agriculture, but some are new to the
field. Note that we have already seen some interesting solution concepts, but we have yet
to start formal TRIZ analysis. However, most, if not all, of these concepts would have no
effect on fruit and nut trees.</p>

<p>The concepts generated thus far would simply be considered Level 1 solutions or good
engineering. These types of solutions represent 32% of the world patent fund in 1974.</p>

<p>Gasanov et al. would suggestion that we next consider looking at the contradictions
contained in the problem. The 40 Principles and separation principles used to deal with
these contradictions would yield concepts that use Level 2 inventiveness.</p>

<p>In our example, to use the previous concepts for solving the problem with the trees
would lead to the physical contradiction that the trees must be short (close to mist,
insulation, radiated heat etc. for warmth) and tall (old enough to bear fruit). Separation
in space suggests that the tree is tall from the ground but short from the heat source.
The same physical contradiction could be related to the fact that a small tree is easy to
cover but a large tree bears fruit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <i><p>(Concept: use dwarf trees.)</p>
  </i>
</blockquote>

<p>Separation in time suggests that small trees be planted in a large greenhouse. Of
course, this presents secondary problems, such as the need for bees for apple tree
pollination.</p>

<p>One answer to the size contradiction of the trees would be the use of cloches. A cloche
is a light-permeable container used to cover plants. The cloche allows growth while it
prevents freezing). However, there is also a large/small contradiction associated with
this solution. The small is ease to handle, but the large is necessary to cover a tree.
The related technical contradiction is: If the cloche covers the tree, then it is
difficult to remove.</p>

<p>None of the separation principles applied to the problem helped in finding a solution.</p>

<p>Moving forward to look for a Level 3 solution, we begin to apply Su-field analysis and
the 76 Standard Solutions. A form of 76 standard solutions exists within Invention
Machine's software. While looking at examples for <i>Structural Change by Redistribution
in Space,</i> we found an example of ice crystals peeling potatoes. Analogic thinking
kicked in and we envisioned a fine mesh cloth being easily draped over the tree, and then
some device like a snow-making machine being used to form an insulating shell around the
tree. Several problems exist:

</p><ul>
  <li>if it is cold enough to form snow the leaves would already be damaged</li>
  <li>the covering could be very heavy</li>
  <li>if it becomes a heat barrier, it would melt.</li>
</ul>

<p>This quickly led to the idea of spraying plastic instead of snow. But now removal again
becomes a problem. Also, it is best if the cloche has no contact with the tree.</p>

<p>A Su-field model of our system shows the cold air as <b>S2</b> and the air against the
leaves as <b>S1</b> with the thermal field <b>F<sub>th</sub></b> (cold). The effect is
undesirable.</p>

<p><img src="image90.jpg" alt="image90.jpg (5470 bytes)" WIDTH="232" HEIGHT="97"></p>

<p>Figure 2</p>

<p>One of the Standard Solutions is to place a substance <b>S3</b> between <b>S1</b> and <b>S2</b>.
The relatively free resource of pond water as a spray is a possibility. This same Standard
Solution can be used to reduce dehydration by coating the leaves with a material that
allows for O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> exchange, but not the movement of water.</p>

<p>As can be seen by this process, the decision-maker quickly has more options and option
combinations than they care to consider. The use of AHP is an excellent means of ranking
the concepts and combinations. AHP is the preferred method of ranking subjective
alternatives. In AHP, the criteria&#146;s importance are always subjective unless the
criteria are measurable and of the same unit of measure.</p>
<b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

<p><img SRC="Image94.gif" WIDTH="252" HEIGHT="66"></font></b></p>

<p>The measure for Ideality can be used to provide the criteria necessary for applying AHP
to rank the options. An example of this is: Reduced risk of frost damage (RR) is a <i>benefit</i>,
installation effort (IE) is a <i>cost</i> and damage to the environment (DE) is a <i>harm.</i>
The three components can be used as the criteria for the paired comparisons that AHP uses
to produce the ratio data necessary for calculating products and ratios.</p>

<p>The first step is to rank the criteria. An approximation to the eigen vectors is used.
The cells in the intersection between rows and columns are used to indicate how much more
or less the row is preferred when compared to the column.</p>

<p>The sprinkler system is the best immediate solution, with a score of .55 compared to
.45 for the water canal system. Several of the other concepts will be used in future
planning, but these solutions require the more extensive work of felling trees, new
planting and construction of a larger pond. Also, study into the characteristics of a
natural microclimate and how to enhance this resource is scheduled.</p>

<p>The Ideality equation used to perform AHP is conceptually similar to engineering's
signal-to-noise ratio. Taguchi's Robust Design uses a signal-to-noise ratio to select the
system parameters, which result in system performance that is insensitive to uncontrolled
sources of variation. Taguchi's signal-to-noise ration has useful energy in the numerator
and wasted energy in the denominator. Also reflected in the denominator is system variance
about the desired target. This metric is an important consideration during the transition
from creating solution concepts using TRIZ to actually engineering these solutions for the
real world, since in the real world there are uncontrolled sources of variation.</p>

<p>For this paper, some of the immediately identified uncontrolled sources of variation
are:

</p><ul>
  <li>plant sensitivity to frost</li>
  <li>time duration of below freezing temperatures</li>
  <li>degrees below freezing</li>
  <li>heat sink quality of soil.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bear in mind for future study that two TRIZ concepts that appear to be equally feasible
can be very different when comparison includes quality of performance metrics such as
performance variation. Also within the scope of this discussion, remember that minimizing
crop damage is ongoing project. Therefore, additional concepts may be created by the time
of the oral presentation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Weakness in Application of Ideal Design</b></p>

<p>To understand the current evolution of a product design it is recommended that the TRIZ
practitioner look at the super-system, system and sub-system. This investigation should
also look at the past present and future of each of these systems. Only by</p>

<p>looking in all directions can the likelihood of an unintentional consequence be
minimized.</p>

<p>Problem solvers and specialists can become so focused that they loose sight of the
larger picture. Cities and the nation have become concerned with air pollution.
Automobiles have been identified as a major contributor to air pollution. MBTE has been
added to gasoline to improve combustion and reduce air pollution. Most organizations were
very happy with the results.</p>

<p>After two years of use governmental units are banning the use because only two parts
per million are sufficient to make water undrinkable because of smell and taste, not to
mention carcinogenic effects.</p>

<p>MBTE is extremely water-soluble. Many wells and ground water have already been
contaminated by storage tank leaks and gasoline spills.</p>

<p>The author was so intent with solving the frost problem that water pollution from the
moving water flowing through the manure fertilized plants and not been considered
initially.</p>

<p>The Ideality equation needs to include the complete life cycle of a product and it's
constituants parts. The impact of the manufacturing process must be considered as well as
recycling and chemicals leaching into the air, water and life in general.This is a
significant challenge for all design professionals and society. Greater profits are
possible by thinking GREEN.</p>

<p>A petroleum-based electric generating facility was violating pollution requirements
because of selenium. Cattails are known for their ability to filter water. Ponds were
built and the selenium level in the cattails became high. Cotton growers need selenium to
enhance cotton growth. The cattails by grinding and selling to cotton farmers became a
small profit center. This is a fine example of use of resources from Permaculture and the
problem formulation generic statement of finding a way to benefit from a harmful event.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Summary</b></p>

<p>Though several interesting concepts were created using the TRIZ methodology, the
concept most appropriate for a short-term solution is the traditional sprinkling of plants
to reduce frost damage. Other concepts will require extensive modification to the existing
system and will be implemented in the future.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Conclusions</b></p>

<p>As expected, the TRIZ methodology does provide breakthrough thinking for agricultural
applications. However, TRIZ is only one aspect of a design process. During the interaction
with subject matter experts, identification of sources of variation should be requested.
These sources of variation should then be included in the problem formulation process. By
considering the super-system and longer time horizon negative environmental impacts can be
reduced.</p>

<p>We are looking for TRIZ solutions and concepts to agricultural and plant growth
problems to publish on our web page. This web page will be <b>public domain</b> for use by
anyone in the world to enhance plant growth and agriculture.</p>

<p>Since, many concepts are created using the TRIZ methodology and have not been confirmed
it is important to identify which concepts have been validated and which are still
concepts. This is important for some individual in a crisis looking for a solution but
finding a concept.</p>

<p>Clearly state the problem, concept, its actual performance and impact upon the
