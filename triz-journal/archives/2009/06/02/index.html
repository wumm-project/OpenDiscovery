<P>By <A href="#authors">Professor V.S. Sreebalaji and Dr. R.  Saravanan</A></P><H2>Abstract</H2><P>Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is a non-traditional process based on thermoelectric energy between a work piece and an electrode. A pulse discharge occurs in a small gap between a work piece and an electrode, and removes the unwanted material from the parent metal through melting and vaporization. The electrode and the work piece must have an electrical conductivity in order to generate a spark. Dielectric fluid acts as a spark conductor, concentrating the energy to a narrow region. There are various types of products that can be produced and finished using EDM such as moulds, dies, aerodynamic parts, automotive and surgical components. This research reveals how vibration can be incorporated into EDM through modeling an advanced design called the ultrasonic electrical discharge machine (UEDM) using the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ).</P><H2>Introduction to EDM</H2><P>In 1770, English scientist Joseph Priestley first detected the erosive effect of electrical discharges on metals. More recently, during research to eliminate erosive effects on electrical contacts, a pair of Soviet scientists, Boris Lazarenko and Natalie Lazarenko (husband and wife), decided to exploit the destructive effect of an electrical discharge and develop a controlled method of metal machining. In 1943, they announced the construction of the first spark-erosion machining device. The spark generator used is known as the Lazarenko circuit. It has been used for years in power supplies in EDM and in an improved form it is used today in many applications.<A href="#Ref1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></P><P>The EDM process can be compared to a conventional cutting process. In this case a suitable shaped tool electrode with a precision controlled feed movement is used in place of a cutting tool. The cutting energy is provided by means of short-term electrical impulses. The EDM application of hard metals or alloys (electrically conductive) cannot be easily machined through conventional methods. This plays a major role in the machining of dies, tools, etc., made of tungsten carbides, stellites or hard steels. Alloys used in the aeronautical industry include hastalloy and nimonic, which also could be machined conveniently by the EDM process. The EDM process also is used to machine exotic materials, refractory metals and hardenable steels. This process offers the added advantage of being capable of machining complicated components and making intricate shapes. Most surgical components such as surface quality (SQ) are machined by this process since EDM is one of the unconventional processes used to produce better SQ.</P><H2>Limitations of EDM</H2><P>There are a number of problems that still need to be solved in order to enable the process for adoption through an extensive process. Some limitations include:</P><OL><LI>Lower material removal rate (MRR) and poor SQ. The real time EDM process objectives are to maximize the MRR and minimize the surface roughness value.<A href="#Ref11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> <LI>The wear rate on the electrode is considerably higher. Sometimes it may be necessary to use more than one electrode to finish a job. <LI>The work piece should be electrically conductive for machining. <LI>The energy required for the operation is more than the conventional process and will be more expensive. <LI>The ignition of spark discharge in a contaminated die electric fluid is another real time process limitation since contamination of the dielectric fluid will affect machining accuracy. The die electric is fresh, meaning it should be free from eroded particles; eroded particles from the work piece can contaminate the die electric fluid. The die electric fluid should be filtered before reuse to ensure that contamination will not affect the machining accuracy.<A href="#Ref1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></LI></OL><H2>Introduction to TRIZ</H2><P>The <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/what_is_triz/">Theory of Inventive Problem Solving</A> (TRIZ) is a method based on logic and data. It accelerates one's ability to research and creatively solve daily problems including impossible-to-solve problems. The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving also provides repeatability, predictability and reliability due to its structure and algorithmic approach. <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2008/11/06/">Genrich Altshuller</A> and his colleagues developed the method between 1946 and 1985. Altshuller discovered that the evolution of a technical system follows predictable patterns. Inventiveness and creativity can be taught. TRIZ has helped solve thousands of difficult technical problems and several Fortune 500 companies are successfully applying TRIZ. </P><P>Given a good inventive technique, the impossible becomes the possible. The TRIZ approach is included in a rather rigorous step-by-step process, somewhat similar to an <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/1998/04/d/index.htm">algorithm</A>, although not as rigorous as a formal mathematical algorithm. This problem solving algorithm is called ARIZ (algorithm for inventive problem solving). For the past 60 years the research on the algorithm has unfolded in several stages. </P><P>The three primary findings of this research are as follows:</P><OL><LI>Problems and solutions are repeated across industries and sciences. The classification of the <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2002/08/c/index.htm">contradictions</A> in each problem predicts the creative solutions to that problem. <LI>Patterns of technical evolution are repeated across industries and sciences. <LI>Creative innovations use scientific effects outside the field(s) where they were developed.<A href="#Ref12"><SUP>12</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref13"><SUP>13</SUP> </A></LI></OL><P>As an international science of creativity, TRIZ, relies on the study of the patterns of problems and solutions, not on the spontaneous and intuitive creativity of individuals or groups. More than four million patents have been analyzed to discover the patterns that predict breakthrough solutions to problems. Research for TRIZ began with the hypothesis that there are universal principles of creativity and they are the basis for creative innovations for advancing technology. If these principles could be identified and codified they could be taught to people to make the process of creativity more predictable. The idea is: Somebody someplace has already solved this problem (or one similar to it). Creativity is finding that solution and adapting it to this particular problem.</P><P><A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/1999/02/e/index.htm">Unified Structured Inventive Thinking</A> (USIT) is an Americanized TRIZ term. It is one of such simplified methodologies developed in the United States. It recommends a simple yet powerful process of problem solving. It is composed of three stages:</P><OL><LI>Problem definition, <LI>Problem analysis and <LI>Concept generation.<A href="#Ref14"><SUP>14</SUP></A></LI></OL><P>In Japan, TRIZ has been introduced and promoted by the <EM>Nikkei Mechanical Journal</EM>, Mitsubishi Research Institute, <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2001/02/e/index.htm">Sanno Institute of Management</A>,&nbsp;and by professor Yotaro Hatamura's group at the University of Tokyo and in various pioneering Japanese industries. </P><H2>The Essence of TRIZ </H2><P>There are many important principles and methods in TRIZ including:</P><OL><LI><A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/1998/11/d/index.htm">Altshuller's 39</A> generic engineering parameters <LI>The <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2000/11/b/index.htm">contradiction matrix</A> <LI>The <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2001/09/e/index.htm">40 inventive principles</A> <LI>The <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2000/03/d/index.htm">76 standard solutions</A> <LI><A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2008/05/03/">Trends of evolution</A> <LI><A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/1998/04/d/index.htm">Algorithm for inventive problem solving</A> (ARIZ)</LI></OL><H2>Current Research Trends in EDM Development</H2><P>&nbsp;There are two kinds of EDM research trends: the modeling technique and the novel technique.<A href="#Ref2"><SUP>2</SUP></A></P><OL><LI>The modeling technique deals with mathematical modeling, artificial intelligence and optimization techniques like regression analysis, artificial neural network and the genetic algorithm. They are used to validate the efforts of input parameters on output parameters, because EDM is a complicated process. It has controlled input parameters like machining depth, tool radius, pulse on time, pulse off time, discharge current, orbital radius, radial step, offset depth and output parameters. It is similar to the MRR and SQ.<A href="#Ref2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> <LI>Novel techniques deal with other (unconventional) machining principles (such as ultrasonic) that can be incorporated into EDM to improve efficiency of the process by offering better MMR and SQ. </LI></OL><H2>A Single Engineering Parameter and Inventive Principles</H2><P>Sometimes a designer knows only one parameter to improve the system, but does not know – or cannot predict – the corresponding contradiction parameter of the system. There are several techniques in TRIZ that do not require a definition of a contradiction (the system operator, the ideal final result (IFR) and the 76 standard solutions all work without explicit definitions of a contradiction). </P><P>An inventive approach for a designer to solve an engineering innovative design problem without contradiction information can be accomplished by using the <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2008/01/03/">40 inventive principles</A>. This allows a designer to use one engineering parameter to improve system performance regardless of whether or not the presence of a contradiction parameter is known. This approach includes three steps:</P><OL><LI>This method examines all corresponding inventive principles associated with each improving parameter in the <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2001/09/f/index.htm">TRIZ contradiction table</A>. Particular principles were seen a number of times. This is because the inventive principles will make improvements to a certain improving parameter in the system, possibly corresponding with other parameter types avoiding degeneration. Certain inventive principles appeared more often, indicating that they are good options to try when solving an innovative design problem. <LI>The same procedures were applied to each parameter avoiding degeneration in another dimension of the TRIZ contradiction table. The corresponding inventive principles were examined and were accounted for their number of appearances. The use of these principles by a designer means that she can simultaneously improve a system's parameters and can avoid the deterioration of certain parameters. Certain inventive principles appear many times. This will give a designer a good start to try and solve innovative design problems. <LI>The combination of both parts, and summing up the number of appearances of all of the principles constructed (for a single engineering parameter and inventive principles), is shown in Table 1. The vertical axis is the 39 parameters of TRIZ that a designer wants to improve. The horizontal axis shows the frequency of appearances of each parameter's corresponding principles. Table 1 classifies inventive principles into different ranks, such as A (more than 19 times), B (16 to 18 times), C (13 to 15 times), D (10 to 12 times), E (7 to 9 times), F (4 to 6 times) and G (1 to 3 times), according to the number of appearances in the contradiction table for each parameter. Most frequently the appearances of the principles (ranked at A, B or C in Table 1) will have a better chance of success in solving an inventive design problem. A designer, therefore, can solve the engineering innovative design problem without contradiction information by choosing a suitable TRIZ inventive principle based on information shown in the table.</LI></OL><P><TABLE cellSpacing=2 cellPadding=2 width="90%" align=center border=1><TBODY><TR><TD bgColor=#000099 colSpan=9><FONT color=#ffffff><STRONG>Table</STRONG></FONT><FONT

The temperature of an electrode also plays a role in machining since hot tools of present inventions have increased machining accuracy and also prevents the machining area from becoming messy due to the molten state of a work piece surface.<A href="#Ref2"><SUP>2</SUP></A></P><P>The proposed new design recommendations may be implemented through real time application in future experimental research. </P><H2>Inventive Principle(s) for Better SQ in EDM Using a Single Engineering Parameter and Inventive Principles</H2><P>To improve SQ of work material (Table 1), a generic parameter such as brightness is used. Do not try to find a parameter that fits perfectly as defined by the matrix. Inventive principles suggested by Table 1 for a single engineering parameter and <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2002/08/d/index.htm">inventive principles</A> include:<A href="#Ref10"><SUP>10</SUP></A></P><P>Periodic action, 19<BR>Segmentation, 1<BR>Other way around, 13<BR>Color change, 32</P><P>The four suggested generic principles include:</P><H3>Principle 19, Periodic Action</H3><P>A. Instead of continuous action, use periodic or pulsating actions.<BR>B. If an action is already periodic, change the periodic magnitude or frequency (replace a continuous with changes in amplitude and frequency).<BR>C.&nbsp;Use pauses in between impulses to perform a different action.</P><H3>Principle 1, Segmentation</H3><P>A. Divide an object into independent parts.<BR>B. Make an object easy to disassemble.<BR>C. Increase the degree of fragmentation or segmentation (use powdered welded metal instead of foil or rod to get better penetration).</P><H3>Principle 13, Other Way Around</H3><P>A. Invert the action used to solve the problem.<BR>B. Make movable parts fixed and fixed parts movable (rotate the parts).<BR>C. Turn the object or process upside down.</P><H3>Principle 32, Color Changes</H3><P>A. Change the color of an object or its external environment.<BR>B. Change the transparency of an object or its external environment.<BR>C. Use a colored additive.<BR>D. Change the emissivity properties of an object subject to radiant heating.</P><H3>New Design Using TRIZ for Better SQ in EDM</H3><UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 5px"><LI>Principle 1, segmentation: in order to increase the degree of fragmentation various types of powder additives may be used for better penetration and fragmentation during machining process (and this was suggested in the earlier design). <LI>Principle 13, other way around: suggests making movable parts fixed and fixed parts movable and rotate. Rotation may be given to an electrode to have a better SQ. See the block diagram of a new experimental design of EDM, in Figure 3. </LI></UL><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure <FONT color=#ffffff>3:</FONT></B><FONT color=#ffffff> New Experimental Design of <BR>&nbsp;Electrical Discharge Machine Using TRIZ</FONT></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=317 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2009-06-vsrs_03.gif" width=308 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><UL><LI>Principle 32, color change, was given a direction to use a colored additive to increase the observability of the machining process to recycle or replace with an electrolyte for effective MRR and better SQ. The proposed new design recommendations may be implemented through real time application and the same may be validated in future research. </LI></UL><H2>Further Scope of TRIZ Applications in Modern Machining Processes</H2><P>The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving may be used to amalgamate various process principles to make hybrid machines. Mullard Research Laboratories in the United States developed a process that combines electro chemical reactions with <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/1999/07/a/index.htm">ultrasonic</A> abrasions; it was found that tool steel can be machined nine times faster than by ultrasonic alone.<A href="#Ref1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> The authors suggest that TRIZ may be used for hybrid ultrasonic with electro chemical machining (ECM) process research and achieving maximum results with minimal effort. </P><H2>Conclusion</H2><P>This work reveals how TRIZ has been used in EDM research to help overcome the limitations of existing EDM processes and to lend a new design. As EDM research is concerned, work began in 1996 and research continues on improving the machining performance. Research work that has taken 20 years through trial and error can be accomplished in a few weeks using TRIZ. The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) is a vibrant methodology. By using TRIZ, EDM research can be achieved with maximum results with minimal effort; this has been validated through previous research findings. It can be used to extend EDM research and the proposed recommendations and design may be implemented in a real time operation.&nbsp;</P><H2>References</H2><OL><LI><A name=Ref1></A>P.C. Pandey, H.S.
