<P>By <A href="#authors">Dmitry Kucharavy and Roland De Guio</A></P><H2>Abstract</H2><P>Extensive historical and logistic analysis of competition dynamics was presented in the authors' work at INSA (National Institute of Applied Science) in France titled: Logistic Substitution Model and Technological Forecasting. This work treated the economic system as a technical model, where the models modified <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/1997/01/b/default.asp">forecasts</A>. The application of several models (more than 300) based on the logistic growth function including simple logistic, component logistic models (CLM) and logistic substitution models (LSM) in the context of technology changed the future of forecasting. </P><P>The main idea of this paper is to revise existing models and arrange a working hypothesis for future research. First, the authors review the features of a simple logistic model as they are presented with different types of competition including a component logistic model that is presented in brief. Second, logistic substitution models in the context of long-term technological forecasting are reviewed. And lastly, a hypothesis about how to improve the reliability of logistic substitution models for studying the technological future is proposed. </P><H2>Keywords</H2><P>Bi-logistic, multi-logistic, logistic substitution model, resource limitations, technology future study, logistic S-curve, socio-economic cycles</P><H2>Introduction</H2><P><EM>"The whole purpose of science is to find meaningful simplicity in the midst of disorderly complexity."</EM> <BR>— Herbert A.

Among inventor and researcher, Galileo Galilei's (1564-1642), many achievements was his excellent forecast about the periodic return and nature of a <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2002/10/d/index.htm#top">comet</A>. As the "father of modern science," he made this forecast based on observations and a mathematical model. In fact, forecasting plays a significant role in the development of science as soon as it is employed as a method to verify proposed theories and hypothesis.</P><P>Research on long-term technological forecasting is inspired by the description of "the lifeline" of technological systems from the father of the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ), Genrich Altshuller.<SUP><A href="#ref1">1</A></SUP>&nbsp;Where contradiction models, <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/1999/04/c/index.htm">S-curves</A> and the limitation of resources play important roles. A 2005 paper by the authors focuses on problems with the stages of the generic forecasting process – where the distinction among short-, medium- and long-term forecasts, based on three phases of S-curves, is also proposed.<SUP><A href="#ref2">2</A></SUP> One S-curve is typically divided into three phases (<FONT size=2>Figure 1</FONT>): before point <FONT face=Symbol>a</FONT>, between points <FONT face=Symbol>a</FONT> and&nbsp;<FONT face=Symbol>b</FONT> and after point <FONT face=Symbol>b</FONT>. A short-term technological forecast is one phase of an S-curve, while a medium-term forecast considers two phases. The scope of study for a long-term forecast is usually beyond one technology, since it studies at least three phases on an S-curve and may consider several growth processes and more than one system.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 1:</B> Growth of a Bacteria Colony Consuming Sugar and Minerals in a Closed Petri Dish Fitted to a Logistic Curve </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=430 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2009-02-dkrg-03.GIF" width=437 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P align=left><FONT color=#ffffff><EM>where limit of growth </EM><FONT face=Symbol color=#ffffff>k</FONT><EM> = 50 species, characteristic duration <FONT face=Symbol>D</FONT>t = 2.2 days, midpoint t<SUB>m</SUB> = 2.5 days</EM></FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>An article presented at the 2007 International Conference on Engineering Dynamics depicts theoretical and practical results from two forecasting projects.<SUP><A href="#ref4">4</A></SUP>&nbsp;A critical-to-X feature merges qualitative and quantitative natures of long-term forecasting.

In particular, a growing parameter for consecutive logistic growths is proposed to apply the amount of knowledge in percent of readiness for the transition from exploration to experimentation toward exploitation phases.</P><P>This paper will also develop the applications for reliable and reproducible long-term technological forecasting using the casual method and logistic growth function. After revising the <FONT size=+0>c</FONT>omponent logistic model and logistic substitution models some hypotheses for improving their reliability are proposed.

Not all S-shaped curves, however, are logistic ones. There are symmetric and non-symmetric logistic curves, which are classified as simple logistic functions or complex ones.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>In the scope of research, the authors apply the simple logistic S-curves due to the ease in interpreting the meaning of their parameters and the simplicity in estimating the parameters from their observed phenomenon. In numerous publications it was concluded that the other models of non-symmetric growth have limited application due to their complexity and low efficiency for technology forecasts.<SUP><A href="#ref6">6</A>,<A href="#ref7">7</A>,<A href="#ref8">8</A>,<A href="#ref9">9</A>,<A href="#ref10">10</A></SUP>&nbsp;</P><P>The widespread practical application of the logistic function as a means to depict growth processes started with Thomas Malthus (1766-1834), English economist and author of <EM>An Essay on the Principle of Population</EM>. It was in 1825 when Benjamin Gompertz, the founder of the law of mortality, published work developing the Malthusian growth model for demographic study. Pierre-Francois Verhulst, mathematician and doctor of number theory, offered the first reference to the logistic curve as a model of population growth. In 1923 T. Brailsford Robertson, professor of physiology and biochemistry, suggested using the function to describe the growth process in a single organism or individual. Biologist Raymond Pearl rediscovered the function and used it extensively to describe population growth including human ones. In 1925 and 1926, while working independently, Alfred J. Lotka and Vito Volterra, developers of the Volterra-Lotka equations, generalized the growth equation to quantify competition among different species and coined the predator-prey equations.</P><P>One of the earliest studies about technological substitution described by S-curves was done in 1957 by economist Hirsh Zvi Griliches. Using Griliches' concepts in 1961, Edwin Mansfield, one of the minds behind the diffusion of innovations, developed a model to depict the rate at which firms follow an innovator. In the early 1960s, S-curves were regularly employed for technological forecasting.<SUP><A href="#ref8">8</A></SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2003/04/b/02.pdf">diffusion of innovation theory</A> was formalized by Everett M. Rodgers, author of <EM>Diffusion of Innovations</EM>, in 1962, which postulated innovations that were spread in society in an S-curve.<SUP><A href="#ref18">18</A></SUP></P><P>A significant achievement was accomplished by J. C. Fisher and R. H. Pry (1970), authors of <EM>A Simple Substitution Model of Technological Change</EM>, in formulating the model for binary technological substitution as an extension of Mansfield's findings.<SUP><A href="#ref12">12</A></SUP> A logistic substitution model proposed by Cesare Marchetti described technology substitution in the dynamics of long-run competition (1976-1979) by extensively using the Fisher-Pry transform model.<SUP><A href="#ref7">7</A></SUP>&nbsp;Perrin S.&nbsp;Meyer, author of <EM>Bi-logisitic Growth</EM>, proposed in 1994 the component bi-logistic growth model.<SUP><A href="#ref5">5</A></SUP>&nbsp;Later on, a component logistic model with multi-logistics generalizes this bi-logistic growth model.<SUP><A href="#ref6">6</A></SUP>&nbsp;The application of bi-and multi-logistics makes possible the description of complex growth processes through a family of simple logistic curves.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Logistic substitution and component logistic models in combination with the Fisher-Pry transform technique provide clear and suggestive outputs for supporting medium- and long-term forecasting of technology changes.<SUP><A href="#ref5">5</A>,<A href="#ref6">6</A>,<A href="#ref7">7</A>,<A href="#ref8">8</A>,<A href="#ref11">11</A>,<A href="#ref13">13</A>,<A href="#ref14">14</A>,<A href="#ref15">15</A>,<A href="#ref16">16</A></SUP> </P><H2>Simple Logistic Models (SLM)</H2><P>The natural growth of autonomous systems in competition might be described by logistic equation and logistic curve, respectively. In the context of our proposed research, natural growth is defined as the ability of a species (system) to multiply inside finite niche capacity (or carrying capacity of a physical limit of resources) through a certain time period.<SUP><A href="#ref5">5</A>,<A href="#ref1">1</A></SUP> </P><P>As soon as the function parameters can be calculated using a partial set of data such as the efficiency of changes in the internal combustion engine over the last 20 years, it is possible to use the equation in a predictive mode, as in how much that efficiency will grow and when. The availability of a reliable set of data is a principal limiting factor for S-curve model application in the forecast of emerging technologies.</P><P>For socio-technical systems the three-parameter S-shaped logistic growth model is applied to describe continuous trajectories of growth or decline through time.<SUP><A href="#ref1">1</A></SUP>&nbsp;</P><P>Example 1:</P><P><IMG height=36 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2009-02-dkrg-01.GIF" width=122 border=0></P><P>Where N(t) is the number of species or growing variables in question; <FONT face=Symbol>k</FONT> is the asymptotic limit of growth;&nbsp;<FONT face=Symbol>a</FONT> specifies&nbsp;width or steepness of the S-curve (for example,&nbsp;<FONT face=Symbol>a</FONT> = 0.19 means approximately 19 percent growth per time fraction); it is frequently replaced with a variable that qualifies the time required for the trajectory to grow from 10 percent to 90 percent of limit <FONT face=Symbol>k</FONT>; (<FONT face=Symbol>D</FONT>t)<SUP>2</SUP> is characteristic duration;&nbsp;<FONT face=Symbol>b</FONT> specifies the time (t<SUB>m</SUB>) when the curve reaches 0.5<FONT face=Symbol>k</FONT> at midpoint of the growth trajectory (t<SUB>m</SUB> implies symmetry of a simple logistic S-curve). <BR>These three parameters <FONT face=Symbol>k</FONT>, <FONT face=Symbol>a</FONT> and <FONT face=Symbol>b</FONT> are usually calculated by fitting the data.

In the context of long-term technological forecasts, technology diffusion can be presented as a process of transition from invention to innovation.<SUP><A href="#ref17">17</A>,<A href="#ref18">18</A></SUP>&nbsp;Such a transitional process from the first feasible <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/1999/11/f/index.htm">prototype</A> to the first regular product and <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2007/11/05/">new market creation</A> takes time, for example:</P><UL><LI>The <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2001/07/f/index.htm">photography</A> medium took 112 years <LI>The steam locomotive took 55 years <LI>Rolled wires took 47 years <LI>The lead battery took 79 years <LI>Arc <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/1999/07/a/index.htm">welding</A> took 49 years<SUP><A href="#ref17">17</A></SUP> </LI></UL><P>In the framework of present research invention is defined as: the result of engineering activities in a technological context, which resolves contradictions between specific needs (how it was perceived) and known laws of nature. The output of the invention process is a feasible solution and working prototype, but not necessarily a <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2009/01/02/">patent</A>. Innovation is the result of socio-economic and technological activities. It produces added value because of an uncommon way of doing business. It seems meaningless to compare <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/1999/01/a/index.htm">invention</A> and innovation. They result from different activities and their values are measured by different parameters.</P><P>From invention to innovation, technology diffusion is a long and bumpy road full of uncompromising competition. Hundreds of thousands of inventions have never become innovations. When innovation occurs, the long delay from invention to innovation makes it difficult to study the causality of the innovation process.&nbsp;Unfortunately, these facts are frequently ignored in studies about invention/innovation relationships.</P><P>Competition among emerging technologies plays a crucial role in technology diffusion. One of the basic assumptions for long-term forecasts is: all systems (super-systems, sub-systems) that evolve under competition according to the law of logistic growth. Mechanisms of competition should be divulged and purposefully applied for technology forecasting in a reproducible way.</P><P><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff">Physicist and futurist </FONT>Theodore Modis, described the scientific approach of managing competition&nbsp;where two competitors can influence each other's growth rate in six ways:</P><OL><LI>Pure competition: Pure competition is when both species suffer from each other's existence because they use the same resources to survive. The traditional example of this occurs between rabbits and sheep. Each one decreases the growth of the other, but at a different rate (sheep multiply more slowly than rabbits, but eat more grass). <LI>Predator-prey: Predator-prey competition is a relationship where two species interact as predator and prey. The predators flourish when there is abundant prey. Ultimately, predators surpass their food supply and decline. When the predator population is low the prey population will increase once again. These dynamics go on in cycles of growth and decline. A classic example of this is in the case of rabbit (prey) and fox (predator) populations. The Lotka-Volterra equations are usually applied to simulate the dynamics of this kind of competition. <LI>Symbiosis: Symbiosis is a situation where both species benefit thanks to their association. For instance, mobile phone sales trigger the increase of operators and new services and this escalation provokes sales of the latest mobile phone models. <LI>Parasitic (win-impervious): Parasitic (win-impervious) is a relationship between two species where one obtains some benefit while the other is unaffected. A classic example of this comes from biology: the remora fish attaches to sharks and feeds on their leavings without hindering its hosts. A market example of this is the increase in digital camera and computer sales, which prompted growth in the external hard disc market. The sale of external hard disks, however, does not influence the sale of digital cameras. <LI>Symbiotic (loss-indifferent): Symbiotic (loss-indifferent) is a situation when one species suffers from the existence of another, which remains insensible to what is happening. A textbook case from biology is the shading out of one plant by a taller and wider one.&nbsp; <LI>No-competition: No-competition is a relationship between two species when there is no overlap in using resources to evolve. For instance, sales of coffee do not affect sales of tea in the same supermarket. Sales depend on seasonal variations rather than on competition between two products.<SUP><A href="#ref13">13</A></SUP> </LI></OL><P>In addition to two-competitor cases, the competition of one species for resources (Malthusian case), such as multiple competitors as well as a model of indirect competition (as in spatial competition when A interacts with B, and B with C, then C affects A through B) are revealed. Given the number of various competition models it is not easy to subsequently build a practical instrument. Such a study becomes inadequately complex and time-consuming with multiple opportunities for hidden errors and biases.</P><P>Problems can be formulated when it is necessary to take into account competition mechanisms. In order to be considered intrinsic processes they must occur within a technology diffusion with multiple competitors. But it is necessary to avoid the analysis of competition mechanisms because it complicates applied models and increases study costs. In addition, the complex models leave room for hidden errors, biases and as a result they cause inadequate output. <BR></P><H2><BR>Component Logistic Model (CLM)</H2><P><EM>"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck."</EM><BR>— Theodore Modis</P><P>The necessity of a feasible model to describe systems that experience two or more phases of growth became vital (for medium- and long-term forecasting) as soon as the logistic S-curve had been extensively applied to and studied in a wide range of socio-technical systems.</P><P>Starting with the assumption that the standard logistic S-curve describes one period (or pulse) of growth for a particular system then multiple growth <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/1997/03/d/index.html">pulses</A> depict many systems.<SUP><A href="#ref5">5</A></SUP> Defining a system is a difficult task in itself. One of the fundamental facts of the system approach is that all systems interact with their environment. In order to portray this phenomenon the system operator (multi-screen schema) must link super-systems, systems and sub-systems as well as past, present and future dimensions.</P><P>A system is a demarcated part of the universe, which is separated from the rest by an imaginary border. These artificial borders are unavoidable. In order to perceive or know anything one must make this distinction. How can one be sure about the delineation of a system? What are the criteria that justify the location of an artificial boundary?&nbsp;To develop a <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2002/01/c/index.htm">system definition</A> it is necessary to situate the boundaries and describe the characteristics of the system. The features of the universe affect the system outside of the system (super-system) along with the interactions between universe and system.</P><P>Due to difficulties with the definition of the system, the time-series data cannot be cleaned and split properly. This leads to problems with fitting logistic S-curves to data. Before Perrin S. Meyer proposed bi-logistic and multi-logistic&nbsp;(for multi-logistic model growth is the sum of <EM>n</EM> simple logistics) models, complex multi-parameter functions were applied for the extrapolation of this sort of data.<SUP><A href="#ref5">5</A>,<A href="#ref6">6</A></SUP>&nbsp;</P><H3>The Problem</H3><P>The <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2002/03/b/index.htm">evolution of systems</A> should be described by multi-parameter complex functions and curves since the systems rarely follow a single S-curve trajectory due to indigenous complexity (systems such as sub-systems and sub-processes; the irregularity of system parts evolution, etc.) as well as exogenous complexity (systems such as quasi-random behavior due to multiple interactions with other systems, etc.). The <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2002/06/d/index.htm#top">evolution of systems</A>, however, should be described by (symmetrical) simple three-parameter logistic functions to provide clear physical interpretations. These interpretations are comparable with other system evolutions in order to decrease errors during forecasting and to be applicable in practice.</P><H3>The Solution</H3><P>The component logistic model describes the complex growth processes using a combination of simple three-parameter functions by applying bi-logistics or multi-logistics.<SUP><A href="#ref5">5</A>,<A href="#ref6">6</A></SUP> The mechanism of combination resembles the <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2004/09/03.pdf">nested doll</A> principle and once again confirms the fractal feature concept of natural growth.<SUP><A href="#ref1">1</A>,</SUP><A href="#ref20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> </P><P><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff">For instance,</FONT> a single simple logistic curve does not provide adequate level of residuals to study the dynamics of U.S. <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/1997/12/b/index.html">nuclear</A> tests.<SUP><A href="#ref5">5</A>,</SUP><A href="#ref21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>&nbsp;While a bi-logistic growth curve fits data with acceptable residuals (Figure 2).</P><P>Such a result was interpreted the following way: "…the fastest rate of growth (midpoint) of the first pulse occurred in 1963 following the Cuban missile crisis. While the first logistic pulse was largely the race to develop bombs with higher yields, the second pulse, cantered in 1983 and nearing saturation now (1994), is probably due to research on reliability and specific weapons designed for tactical use. The bi-logistic model predicts that we are at 90 percent saturation of the latest pulse. Processes often expire around 90 percent, though sometimes processes overshoot. The residuals show the extraordinary, deviant increase in U.S. tests after the scare of the 1957 Sputnik launch…"<SUP><A href="#ref5">5</A></SUP> </P><P>When reasonable interpretation is done the application of component models provides suggestive and attention-grabbing results. The practical experience shows, however, that experts might need several weeks to propose a realistic interpretation for obtained fits.</P><P>One of the remarkable characteristics of the component logistic model is its self-adjustment to a proposed definition of a system. Through the reduction of residuals and decomposition of an initial set of data by multi-logistic ones the initial definition of a system can be corrected and refined.

In further research, the plan is to explore the direction through sub-systems using this casual method based on logistic growth of knowledge within the invention-to-innovation process.<SUP><A href="#ref3">3</A></SUP></P><P>The authors conclude that the basic patterns of technological changes are invariant based on the application of laws of technical system evolution, logistic growth and cycles&nbsp;as main components.<SUP><A href="#ref1">1</A>,<A href="#ref11">11</A>,<A href="#ref39">39</A></SUP> This application of knowledge about cycles and laws of logistic growth models (SLM, CLM, LSM) makes long-term technological forecasting possible as it soon helps resolve an incompatibility between cause-effect description (scientific) and the inadequate complexity of a model (practical).</P><P>The <A href="http://www.triz-journal&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/archives/2002/01/d/index.htm">multi-screen scheme of thinking</A>,&nbsp;in combination with the concept that "competition is possible only in a common infrastructure,"&nbsp;makes the management of model complexities possible through the synergy of the CLM and the LSM.<SUP><A href="#ref1">1</A>,<A href="#ref37">37</A></SUP> The CLM allows the description of the logistic growth of a system from a viewpoint of sub-system evolution and endogenous competition mechanism. The LSM provides a means for depicting technological change and performing long-term forecasting of socio-technical systems from super-systems and exogenous competition factor viewpoints.</P><P>For logistic growth models, the critical point for forecasting is the interpretation of results. For instance, in the case of the CLM, it is a nontrivial task to recognize the essential underlying mechanisms of obtained bi- or multi-logistic growths. In one practical case it takes more than three weeks to understand the underlying mechanism of the constructed triple-logistic model. In the case of the LSM, it is a challenging task to name the next technology. Even the time parameters of growth can not be accurately identified in such a short period of time.</P><P>Another remaining question is what are the regularities of evolution for systems which never show innovation? It is a well-known fact that before point <FONT face=Symbol>a</FONT>, systems do not display logistic growth behavior (see Figures 3, 4 and 5).</P><P>In conclusion, it is necessary to emphasis the crucial role of forecasters, especially since they play a decisive one. The reliable forecasting method alone is not enough for accurate long-term prediction. It will never be a push-button solution. Like any powerful tool, a method can produce a great outcome in the hands of the intelligent, but it may demonstrate misleading results in the hands of the inexperienced.</P><H2>Acknowledgments</H2><P>This research was partially supported by the European Institute for Energy Research (EIFER) in Karlsruhe, Germany.
