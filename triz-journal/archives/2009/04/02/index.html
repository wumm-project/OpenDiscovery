<P>By <A href="#authors">Andreas Roderburg, Fritz  Klocke and Christoph  Zeppenfeld</A></P><H2>Abstract</H2><P>Current developments of hybrid production processes or production systems have exceeded performance in manufacturing. What most of these developments have in common is that they have been found to be intuitive. In the past, the development of new hybrid production systems have led to large amounts of operative planning. The challenge is to develop a systematic and scientific approach for aggregating, describing, explaining and combining single processes. This paper introduces a systematic approach of the design methodology for developing hybrid production processes. The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) tools are used in terms of identifying hybrid process solutions as part of an innovation process. They are also shown concerning the specific requirements of manufacturing process development.</P><H2>Introduction</H2><P>T<FONT size=2>he manufacturing of innovative products often fails due to technological limitations of today's production systems and processes. The hybridization of manufacturing processes can help to break the limits of today's production systems and to realize innovative products. Developments of new hybrid manufacturing technologies, thus, arouse high expectations.</FONT></P><P><FONT size=2>Previous developments of hybrid machining processes are mostly based on intuitive or random solutions. A methodology for the systematic development of hybrid machining technologies does not exist. But as is known from other scientific disciplines, a big part of solutions can not be found effectively without a methodological approach.<A href="#Ref1"><SUP>1</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref2"><SUP>2</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref3"><SUP>3</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> It can be assumed, therefore, that up to now the full potential of hybrid technologies has not been exploited.</FONT></P><H2>Hybrid Production Processes</H2><H3>Ontology of Hybrid Production Processes</H3><P>Within hybrid production processes different forms of energy or forms of energy&nbsp;caused in different ways are used at the same time at the same zone of impact. Hybrid production processes are also defined as the combination of effects that are conventionally caused by separated processes in one single process at the same time.<A href="#Ref5"><SUP>5</SUP></A></P><P>The realization of hybrid production processes is based on two approaches. First, through the integration of specific forms of energy in the work area of the process; where the machinability of the workpiece material is improved. Or second, through the process mechanisms where characteristics are improved.</P><P>For the realization of these approaches, one or more supplementary forms of energy have to be coupled into the existing process. For this purpose several different forms of energy combinations are possible consisting of thermal, mechanical or chemical energy, although the technological advantage and the possibilities of realization must be considered.<A href="#Ref6"><SUP>6</SUP></A></P><H2>Potentials of Hybrid Production Processes</H2><P>For the majority of companies in the production industry – especially in high wage countries – innovation is one of the most important factors of success. In regards to this matter it is not only the product idea that contributes to a higher success, but also the capability of optimal production processes. (In this context "optimal" means most efficient, flexible and stable at the same time.) Broad manufacturing process know-how is necessary to run a technology near its limits of performance. In most cases using current manufacturing technologies (by means of conventional optimization) does not lead to a leap in performance. Hybridization of conventional technologies is a way of reaching new technology capabilities in production systems. Figure 1 illustrates how hybrid processes can improve a production in terms of process chain shortening or the realization of new product qualities.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 1:</B> Aims of Hybrid Production Processes</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=261 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2009-04-fkarcz_1.gif" width=326 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>The described technology integrations of the process chain can be shortened due to the substitution of several processes by a single hybrid process. This can lead to a reduction of planning operations that are necessary to synchronize several processes in a process chain, even though a hybrid process may be more complex and may cause more requirements concerning process stability. A second aim of developing hybrid processes is to realize new product qualities. For example, by hybridization a conventional process can be enabled to a machine for new materials, which according to the state of the art, could not yet be machined by the conventional process. Based on these new production capabilities innovative products could be realized, which could not be produced (economically), due to the technological limitations of today's production technologies.</P><H2>Methodology Development</H2><P>The research and development of production technologies often focuses on single production processes concerning specific applications. This research is specialized and vital for understanding the mechanisms of known production processes. The knowledge about the mechanisms of single technologies enables these production processes to be adapted and optimized for a wide field of specific product requirements. According to the S-curve theory the possibility of process improvement decreases after a specific time when considering single processes. In this state the technology is optimized near its limits. In the case of conventional, widely investigated manufacturing technologies, production research often focuses on adapting the known technologies for new applications such as the machining of new workpiece materials. On the other hand, more capable and efficient manufacturing technologies have to be developed. Assume that the possibilities of hybrid production technologies is not utilized. The development of new inventive production technologies has to consider and combine the mechanisms of different single processes. For this purpose the integration of profound process knowledge from different production technology disciplines is necessary. In order to provide the broad field of necessary knowledge it has to be compressed in an abstract way to get new ideas, which is the first step of inventive solutions. The aim of the described scientific work is to develop a systematic tool for:</P><UL><LI>Optimization of technology chains based on technology profiles. <LI>Describing and explaining limits in technology. <LI>Generating inventive solutions as in terms of hybrid production technologies.</LI></UL><H2>The Steps of Hybrid Production Process Design and TRIZ</H2><P>To find inventive (hybrid) process solutions, different steps have to be proceeded. Figure 2 shows a general structure of the methodology and its similarities to the general TRIZ algorithm.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 2:</B><FONT color=#ffffff> Steps of the Design Methodology for Production <BR>&nbsp;Processes and Similarities to the General TRIZ Algorithm</FONT></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=323 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2009-04-fkarcz_2.gif" width=348 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>The presented approach is based on the assumption that a new process solution can be developed only if the limits of a technology are known with their reasons and can be described. The limits of technologies can be characterized in terms of problems, while a problem is defined as a contradiction. Thus, in the first steps of the methodology the problems of today's technologies must be analyzed systematically. The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving provides several tools for the purpose of analyzing problems. In accordance with TRIZ the technology limits are described in terms of standard problems through abstract physical or technical contradictions. By means of TRIZ, standard solutions can be identified for standard problems (by the contradiction matrix, separation principles or standard solutions for substance field models).<A href="#Ref7"><SUP>7</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref8"><SUP>8</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref9"><SUP>9</SUP></A><SUP>,</SUP><A href="#Ref10"><SUP>10</SUP></A></P><P>Based on an aggregation of solutions and mechanisms of known production processes – as well as single and hybrid processes – analogies can be provided to support the search for a specific solution.

This is known from laser-supported turning or laser-supported incremental sheet metal forming.</P><H2>Description Level: Identification of Limits</H2><P>Technology capabilities can be described by several criteria composed of output quantities or output characteristics, which are related to the resulting workpiece, the tool wear or the productivity (see Figure 3).

This kind of description model reduces the complexity of a manufacturing process. In manufacturing research the correlations between input and output parameters of a specific process are often described by empiric-analytical models, which are based on experimental investigations. The results of these investigations are used for the purpose of process chain generation. In a process chain the workpiece state output of one single process is the workpiece state input of the following process until the desired workpiece condition is reached.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 4:</B> <FONT color=#ffffff>Black Box Model of a <BR>&nbsp;Production Process</FONT></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=160 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2009-04-fkarcz_4.gif" width=254 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>The description of the workpiece state before and after the manufacturing process classifies the workpiece characteristics into macro geometry, surface topography, surface layer and bulk features.

For this purpose a workpiece element is defined. The difference between the states of the workpiece element (before and after a manufacturing process) describes the manipulation of the workpiece by the process. For the use of process chain generation the considered technology is sufficiently described by the change of the workpiece element characteristics. Figure 5 shows an example of a workpiece influenced by a grinding process. The surface layer consists of a re-hardening zone and an annealing zone.

The change of view from the phenomenological to an interpretational view is also expressed by the terms that are used within the process models. Within the description level the terms of input and output mainly have been used. Within the interpretation level technology outputs are understood as effects at the end of a cause-and-effect chain. The production process is therefore no longer described as a black box, but it is characterized by a cause-and-effect chain as shown in Figure 7.</FONT></SPAN></P><P><SPAN lang=EN-GB><FONT size=2>Compared to the descriptive process model in Figure 4 the process is divided into two sub-models. The first sub-model "Interaction" is technology specific. It represents the mechanisms of interaction among the production system elements such as the interactions between tool and workpiece. Within these interactions energies are transmuted, which means that the kinematic energy of a moving tool or workpiece is transmuted into work of friction and deformation, leading to mechanical and thermal energy as an effect of the interaction. The effected energies are defined as process characteristics. As a function of place and time these process characteristics describe the production process in a technology unspecific way without the need of profound information about the process input parameters. The unspecific process characteristics of a technology are vital for a common semantic for the purpose of comparing and combining different technologies.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 7:</B> <FONT color=#ffffff>General Interpretation Model of a Manufacturing Process</FONT></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=158 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2009-04-fkarcz_7.gif" width=413 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>The opposite of the sub-model Interaction is the second sub-model: "Impact" and it is technology unspecific. It represents the impact of the process characteristics on the process results such as the workpiece features and the tool wear. Within this sub-model the process characteristics are the root causes of the results. Note: Figure 7 shows a reduced model in order to clarify the idea of the model. In the case of applying to a specific technology problem, it can be adapted or added to by further cause and effect elements, where the influence of specific machine specification supplies such as lubricants and external disturbances is not considered. The feedback of tool wear also is neglected in this model because in this case it is presumed that the principles of physical mechanisms do not change while tool wear appears.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 8:</B> <FONT color=#ffffff>General Model of Cause-and-Effect <BR>&nbsp;Relations According to the Theory of Constraints</FONT><A href="http://www.realinnovation&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;/library/graphics#Ref11"><SUP><FONT color=#ffffff>11</FONT></SUP></A></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=211 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2009-04-fkarcz_8.gif" width=302 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00"><BR></FONT>In order to improve the technology by means of major changes of the manufacturing system it must optimize the existing system by a compromise between process settings, as shown in Figure 8.

The advantage of this diagram is the transparency of the cause-and-effect relationships. In many cases the real root causes are not identified. Instead of this the system has tried to improve by changing parameters that do not have a main impact on the undesired result or parameters. They are effects of the real root causes.

As mentioned in the section titled: Description Level: Identification of Limits, the workpiece material structure transmutations (also called grinding burn) can be divided into a white etching re-hardening zone and an annealing zone, see Figure 5. The annealing zone features a lower hardness than the bulk material. The re-hardening layer is harder and more brittle compared to the bulk material. The general conflicting output criteria of a grinding process concerning grinding burn is shown in Figure 6.</FONT></P><H2>Reasons for Limits of Grinding</H2><P><FONT size=2>The progression of temperature over time is the main influence factor of dimension and modality of the surface layer.

The root causes in terms of setting parameters, therefore, are not considered in Figure 10. As a first step it is also sufficient not to regard the interaction of tool and workpiece. Instead the first object of process improvement is the level of process characteristics, which are assumed to result from the process interactions. In contrast to the other system and process setting parameters, the initial workpiece material features have turned out to be important information, which has to be considered on every abstraction level of the process model. It is a crucial fact that the effects of interaction as well as the effects of process impact such as material structure transmutations depend largely on the initial material state.</P></FONT><H2>Breaking the Limits of Grinding</H2><P><FONT size=2>In order to find a solution for the described problem in terms of TRIZ, the first step is to define the problem in the form of a contradiction.

Both are affected by the total amount of process energy. The use of standard solutions has brought out some known solutions such as using cooling lubricants. Cooling lubricants can improve the ratio between the mechanical and the thermal fields. Up to now no other solution was found to resolve this relation. The problem can then be described by a physical contradiction:</P><UL><LI>Process energy must be high. <LI>Process energy must be low.</LI></UL><P>A possible solution is to apply the principle of separation in time. While in a rough machining process the productivity is high, a damaged surface layer can be compensated afterward by a finishing process. This solution is well known and probably the most applied one in the industry, but it is not a hybrid process solution. To find another solution for this particular problem is a big challenge for future research.</P><P>Another approach is to change the view of examination to the superior system of process chains. As long as there is no specific application to be considered, it is appropriate to describe a process chain. This is commonly linked to grinding technologies. Grinding is mostly used for hard machining and the grinding process often follows a heat treatment process. Here the heat treatment is applied in order to harden the surface layer. The considered process chain consists of soft machining, followed by heat treatment (induction hardening or laser hardening) and then by grinding for hard machining. The heat treatment processes cannot easily be integrated into the production line. For this reason the heat treatment process involves some more processes due to transport and cleaning operations that are time and cost consuming, see Figure 12.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 12:</B> <FONT color=#ffffff>Conventional Process Chain Commonly Linked to a <BR>&nbsp;Grinding Process</FONT></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=89 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2009-04-fkarcz_12.gif" width=373 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>Through an expansion of the cause-and-effect description to the process chain, the TRIZ tools innovation checklist (ICL) and resource checklist (RCL) can be used.

Within the considered process chain an accumulation and comparison of cause-and-effect models of all participating technologies shows a common cause-and-effect relationship shared by the grinding and hardening process, as shown in Figure 13.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 13:</B> <FONT color=#ffffff>Common Cause-and-effect Relationship Shared <BR>&nbsp;by Grinding and Hardening Processes</FONT></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=214 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2009-04-fkarcz_13.gif" width=371 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>Concerning the thermal aspects of the processes the same process characteristics determine the thermal impact onto the workpiece surface layer. While the effect of material structure transformation in grinding leads to undesired grinding burn the material structure transformation in hardening causes the desired process result. The crucial difference between the two technologies is that the initial state of workpiece material of a grinding process is a hardened material, but in hardening the material is unhardened beforehand. Using the principles of ICL/RCL it can be concluded that grinding of hardened material can lead to undesired grinding burn, but in grinding of unhardened materials it may be possible to use the heat progression for the purpose of surface hardening.<A href="#Ref14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> Figure 14 shows the principle of grind-hardening.</P><P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=1 align=center bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=middle><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0><TBODY><TR align=middle><TD vAlign=top><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 bgColor=#001894 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD colSpan=2><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=2 border=0><TBODY><TR><TD align=left><FONT face=arial color=#ffffff size=-1>&nbsp;<B>Figure 14:</B> <FONT color=#ffffff>Figure 14: Principle of <BR>&nbsp;Grind-hardening</FONT></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR><TR bgColor=#ffffff><TD align=middle><IMG height=134 alt="" src="http://www.metodolog.ru/triz-journal/library/graphics/2009-04-fkarcz_14.gif" width=235 border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>As primary experimental investigations have shown, the heat generated in grinding can be utilized for thermal induced surface hardening effect up to mm-scale.
