<p>TRIZ will give your organization the capability for <b><i>breakthrough</i></b>
solutions to difficult technical problems. TRIZ radically enhances the quality and
quantity of idea-generation. People who regard themselves as &quot;uncreative&quot; report
a 12x increase in idea generation, and people regarded as creative &quot;superstars&quot;
report a 3x increase in idea generation. (Ref.1) <br>
</p>

<p>Reading this paragraph, the technical professionals have one of two reactions:<br>

</p><ol>
  <li>If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Just one more piece of hype.
    Management training &quot;flavor of the month.&quot; </li>
  <li>Great! Let's get it in here and everybody will start using it immediately. </li>
</ol>

<p>Participants in this conference don't have to be offered any more information on
reaction &quot;1&quot;-you now have your own experience generating quantities of new
ideas, and seeing that <b><i>breakthrough</i></b> - quality ideas are possible in a field
that had already been thoroughly explored. But now you need to take TRIZ back to your
companies, to get the benefit of solving your own problems, in your own environment, where
you can develop these new ideas for competitive advantage -to patent, to set new
standards, or to get proprietary advantage from being first to market with new concepts,
or all three ways. <br>
</p>

<p>The primary obstacles to company-wide adoption of TRIZ are human, not technical:<br>

</p><ul>
  <li><b>Time</b>: People are too busy &quot;fighting fires&quot; to learn new methods of fire
    prevention </li>
  <li><b>Suspicion:</b> Other &quot;new methods&quot; have over-promised productivity
    improvement, customer satisfaction, faster time to market, higher ROI or EVA, etc. </li>
  <li><b>Traditional methods of project management:</b> If the success of a project is
    measured by traditional milestones, and the new process doesn't match those milestones,
    there will be great pressure to work within the existing system. </li>
  <li><b>The NIH syndrome</b>. NIH means &quot;<i>not invented here</i>&quot; and can have
    double meaning for TRIZ-both &quot;not invented in the organization&quot; and &quot;not
    invented in this country.&quot; A sub-category of NIH is &quot;Well, it may work for
    so-and-so, but it won't work for us.&quot; Our problems are different/high tech/not in
    their data base/controlled by regulators, etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>The flow chart in Fig. 1 describes a method of introducing TRIZ into organizations that
overcomes these obstacles. This method uses no &quot;tricks&quot; of cultural change or
subtleties of organizational dynamics. It gets the technical professionals and technical
managers in engineering, production, distribution, and service to experience TRIZ
immediately, and helps them get <b><i>breakthrough results</i></b> on their own problems
immediately. <br>

<p><b>Figure 1. Flow chart for TRIZ implementation.</b> </p>

<p><b>Project consulting (the &quot;</b><i>External</i><b>&quot;</b> <b>branch marked <img src="IMG00002.GIF" alt="Image not available right now." border="0" WIDTH="46" HEIGHT="46">) can also be done
without initial training, if the goal is to get immediate technical results. <br>
</b></p>

<p>The effect of these immediate increases in creativity is that the obstacles labeled
&quot;suspicion&quot; and &quot;NIH&quot; are removed, and the organization then uses its
own resources (and its enhanced creativity) to reallocate the time of key people. In the
early stages of TRIZ implementation, having a lot of new ideas is not always seen as a
benefit, since the organization may lack the resources to follow up on all of them.<font size="2"> (</font>Ref.2<font size="2">)<br>
</font></p>

<p>The rationale for the process represented by the flow chart will be clear if each step
is analyzed in terms of its direct results-new ideas, new concepts, creativity
improvements-and its organizational change results.<br>
</p>

<p>Step 1 is the organization's decision that increased innovation is needed. Most
commonly this comes from competitive pressure, although occasionally it comes from
regulatory requirements. One or more organization managers are selected to be the TRIZ
&quot;champions&quot; to orchestrate the introduction and institutionalization of TRIZ.<br>
</p>

<p>Step 2 is the selection of one or more pilot projects for TRIZ introduction. The
competitive or regulatory issues, or the organization's problem identification and
corrective action selection system usually identify the candidate problems, and the
&quot;champion&quot; works with the consultant to select those problems which will have
the best combination of high-value payoff and usefulness as future teaching cases. These
projects or problems are used as the case studies for an introductory experiential class. </p>

<p>The class has multiple benefits:<br>

</p><ul>
  <li>Concepts for inventive solutions are generated for the selected projects or problems </li>
  <li>The participants themselves generate the results </li>
  <li>The participants learn to sort the results and get immediate and long-term benefits. </li>
  <li>The participants learn the TRIZ methodology (at the introductory level) well enough to
    apply it themselves </li>
</ul>

<p>Step 3 is implementation of the results of the class. According to the needs of the
organization, this can be done as a joint effort or by the organization itself. The
results generated are solutions to the problems of implementation of the concepts
generated in Step 2, so this is a very visible, valuable reinforcement of the classroom
work in Step 2, with results that have immediate payoff.<br>
</p>

<p>After the successes in Steps 2 and 3, the TRIZ &quot;champion&quot; and the
organization's leadership pick one of 2 paths. The <i>Internal </i>path produces a full
team of internal TRIZ practitioners, who replace the external instructors and consultants
as their skills increase. The <i>External </i>path uses consultants to coach each team as
each project is identified. Hybrid approaches have also been used successfully, in which
the <i>External</i> path is followed for quick results, while the <i>Internal</i> path is
followed for development of future continuity. The <i>External </i>path is also frequently
used for strategic planning, for applications of TRIZ to technology forecasting for the
entire industry and for product platforms, while the <i>Internal </i>path is proceeding.
The internal experts learn the strategic uses of TRIZ, and become internal consultants as
well as instructors, during their advanced topics training.<br>
</p>

<p>As the organization develops its own internal experts, they take the lead in the
integration of TRIZ with the organization's existing methodologies. They become the
collective &quot;champions&quot; in overcoming the last obstacle to TRIZ implementation:
the traditional methods of project management. TRIZ will impact new product projects,
process improvement projects, and process re-engineering projects. Following the
right-hand &quot;<i>Internal</i>&quot; branch of the flow chart will overcome this
obstacle. As more and more people learn TRIZ, and as your company develops its internal
cadre of experts, they will integrate TRIZ with all your other tools. For example<br>

</p><ul>
  <li>TRIZ/QFD. Quality Function Deployment identifies and prioritizes the Voice of the
    Customer, and the capabilities of the company technologies, then helps prioritize new
    concepts for design and production. TRIZ helps you create the new concepts. </li>
  <li>TRIZ/Robust design. Robust design finds the right parameters to minimize all forms of
    waste and cost. TRIZ finds ways of creating the processes that will achieve those
    parameters. </li>
  <li>TRIZ/DFM-A: Design for Manufacturability and Design for Assembly identify and prioritize
    features of design that make manufacturing and assembly low cost, high yield, and short
    cycle time. TRIZ resolves the technical problems encountered when implementing these
    features. Similarly, many organizations have developed their own guidelines for
    &quot;Design for Serviceability&quot; which are enhanced by TRIZ creativity in achieving
    serviceable designs. </li>
  <li>TRIZ/TOC: Theory of constraints is used by many manufacturing organizations to identify
    production bottlenecks. The TOC tools can replace or enhance the problem identification
    steps in TRIZ problem solving, then the TRIZ creativity tools are used to accelerate
    development of ways to remove the bottlenecks. </li>
  <li>TRIZ/Concurrent Engineering (or Integrated Product and Process Engineering, or Product
    Development Teams, or Supplier/Developer/Customer teams) These project management teams
    will use TRIZ at many levels ranging from technology forecasting to conceptual design to
    production design, from implementation problem solving to service, delivery, and repair
    improvements. </li>
</ul>

<p>At this level of integration TRIZ passes from being seen as a tool, or a system of
tools and methods, and becomes an intrinsic part of your organization's method of gaining
competitive advantage. Until it reaches this point, it will require nurturing and
&quot;championship&quot; to keep people aware of their opportunities to apply TRIZ.<br>
