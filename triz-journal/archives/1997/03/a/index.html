<h1>March 1997 Special Issue: TRIZ in Universities</h1>

<p>Two special articles describe the curricula at Florida Atlantic University and at Wayne
State University. We also know that TRIZ is included in courses in engineering departments
in the US at the University of Michigan, University of Connecticut, and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and world-wide at the University of Linkoping (Sweden), Coburg
University (Germany) and University of Twente (Netherlands). Many courses have been
offered as supplements to the regular, degree programs, such as the classes at California
Institute of Technology's Industrial Relations Center. </p>

<p>TRIZ classes in Israel, Mexico, Australia, and throughout Eastern Europe and Russia
have been reported to us, but without enough detail to include here. If you teach
undergraduate or graduate classes in TRIZ, or with TRIZ as part of a class in engineering
or manufacturing technology, please send information to us. </p>

<p>We will publish another special issue later in the year when we have more references. </p>

<p>Thanks!<br>
