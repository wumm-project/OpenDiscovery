      <li><i>Use a porous metal mesh to wick excess solder away from a joint. </li>
      <li>Store hydrogen in the pores of a palladium sponge. (Fuel &quot;tank&quot; for the

</ol>

<p><b>Principle 35. Parameter changes</b> 

<ol TYPE="A">
  <li>A. Change an object's physical state (e.g. to a gas, liquid, or solid. </p><ul>
      <li><i>Freeze the liquid centers of filled candies, then dip in melted chocolate, instead of
        handling the messy, gooey, hot liquid. </li>

        volume. </i></li>

  </li>
  <li>Change the concentration or consistency. </p><ul>
      <li><i>Liquid hand soap is concentrated and more viscous than bar soap at the point of use,
        making it easier to dispense in the correct amount and more sanitary when shared by
        several people. </i></li>

        expansion split the rocks into small pieces which could be pushed aside. </li>
      <li>Heat pumps use the heat of vaporization and heat of condensation of a closed
        thermodynamic cycle to do useful work. </i></li>

<p><b>Principle 40. Composite materials</b> 

<ol TYPE="A">
  <li>Change from uniform to composite (multiple) materials. </p><ul>
