    <p><font face="Arial"><b>Introduction</b>. The oldest living system on earth that attracts
    the broadest interest is the vast system of human beings. The multi-colored array of human
    relations forms a network of human interactions that has been under study since humans
    first walked the earth. The success rate in increasing the effectiveness of human
    relations has been less than satisfactory. One reason for this lack of success is a lack
    of subject matter expertise in human psychology. A second reason is the lack of an
    effective process for moving from vague problem descriptions or problem situations to a
    specific model of the core, or main, problem to be addressed. A further reason is the lack
    of creative solutions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Of these three reasons for the general ineffectiveness of achieving
    sound solutions in the realm of human relations, the lack of an effective
    problem-definition process, and a creative solution approach, have stymied creative
    approaches to such problems. In the field of human relations, certain enlightened,
    problem-solving individuals have appeared from time to time; their works were turned into
    a &quot;latest recipe of the day,&quot; and then that recipe replaced by yet another
    recipe. No general theory and practice ever emerged.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>The TRIZ Approach</b>. The approach called TRIZ came to the
    western world in the late 1980&#146;s from Russia, where it was primarily used to
    creatively address problems and challenges associated with technical systems. TRIZ is the
    Russian acronym for &quot;Theory of the Solution of Creative Problems.&quot; Today in the
    USA and in other western countries, TRIZ has been strategically adopted by forward-moving
    organizations as the concept-generating tool of the century. Little is known, however,
    about the power of the TRIZ approach for significantly improving human relations -
    including the key functions of leadership and management.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b><u>Case Study</u></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>John&#146;s an Effective but Really Brash Guy. </b>The President
    of IsoTech Quadratics knew that, in order to keep the number one product line of ITQ
    moving, John was the person to do it. That&#146;s why John got the job as Vice President
    of ITQ&#146;s main product line. There was no one more active, no one more focused on what
    had to be done, than John. The saying &quot;John pulls no punches,&quot; had a special
    meaning to those who worked for him. He&#146;d look you straight in the eye and ask the
    question that you knew - sometimes you dreaded - he would ask. &quot;Why is that line
    down?&quot; or, &quot;What&#146;s the problem?&quot; or, &quot;What are you doing about
    it?&quot; John&#146;s way of &quot;quickly getting to the heart of the matter&quot; gained
    him the respect of corporate leaders, including the President of ITQ.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">But John also had other qualities. In a nutshell, he was brash,
    insensitive, undiplomatic - sometimes even a social embarrassment. Yet he could never see
    himself in a mirror as being brash and insensitive to others. His recent manners and
    behavior at a local restaurant, where he became intrusively obnoxious with a female
    waitress during order-taking, was just one case in point. But his same brash treatment of
    an R&amp;D department manager had led that valuable individual to leave the company and
    move to a competitor.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">John was a &quot;Let&#146;s get the job done&quot; person, but he
    lacked the patience, vision and human sensitivity required to fully accomplish his role.
    His value to management was that he kept the production line moving. He attracted others
    like himself - soon his group had become quite polarized. There were employees who were
    like John, who imitated and copied his ways; and there were the others who either
    couldn&#146;t stand him, or who would rather avoid his presence. The latter group was far
    less effective than they could have been without John&#146;s constant brashness
    overpowering every situation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">This brief description represents the problem situation. This
    problem was not only the President&#146;s problem. It was a problem for ITQ as a whole. On
    the one hand, John was needed by the company because he and his people kept the production
    line running. On the other hand, not only was he not nurturing and promoting others - he
    was, in fact, destroying ITQ&#146;s future product possibilities through his power-based
    treatment of staff members from ITQ&#146;s research and developmental areas. Not to
    mention the fact that employees from other divisions in the company dreaded bumping into
    him or his people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>Useful and &quot;Harmful&quot; Events Flow Chart</b>. The TRIZ
    approach begins either with a useful or a harmful event description, and solicits
    information about that event. For the harmful event description, this information can be
    expressed in the form of questions: What harmful event or action is caused by it? What
    harmful event or action causes it? What useful event or action causes it? What useful
    event or action eliminates, reduces or prevents it?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The flow diagram illustrated below addresses the key harmful event,
    &quot;JOHN&#146;S INSENSITIVITY CAUSES PROBLEMS WITH THOSE WHO HAVE GOALS OTHER THAN HIS
    OWN PRODUCT-LINE GOALS.&quot; The flow chart indicates that this &quot;harmful&quot; event
    causes &quot;Strife in the new-product development areas of ITQ.&quot; Additionally, there
    are two events that relate to John&#146;s harmful activities in a causal way: a harmful
    action, &quot;John is a single-minded, brash, insensitive individual,&quot; and a useful
    action, the &quot;need to focus on daily production and on today&#146;s market
    success.&quot; Another block in the flow charts is in place to eliminate, reduce, or
    prevent John&#146;s harmful effects on the organization: &quot;Other peer managers, as
    well as the company president, devoting their time and efforts to calming the waters
    between John&#146;s group and other company groups.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img src="97nov2-1.gif" width="471" height="356"></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Two Goal Statements for the problem &quot;<u>JOHN&#146;S
    INSENSITIVITY CAUSES PROBLEMS WITH THOSE WHO HAVE GOALS OTHER THAN HIS OWN PRODUCT-LINE
    GOALS</u>,&quot; are expressed below.</font></p><ol>
      <li><font face="Arial">Find a way to eliminate, reduce, or prevent the situation
        &quot;JOHN&#146;S INSENSITIVITY CAUSES PROBLEMS WITH THOSE WHO HAVE GOALS OTHER THAN HIS
        OWN PRODUCT-LINE GOALS,&quot; without the need for &quot;Other peer managers, as well as
        the company president, devoting their time and efforts to calming the waters between
        John&#146;s group and other company groups.&quot; It is not necessary to change the
        &quot;need to focus on daily production and on today&#146;s market success,&quot; or to
        change the fact that &quot;John is a single-minded, insensitive, brash individual.&quot;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">Find a means to use the situation &quot;JOHN IS INSENSITIVE TO THE
        NEEDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE GOALS OTHER THAN HIS OWN PRODUCT-LINE GOALS.&quot; to advantage.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Arial">A close examination of these goal statements reveals that they have
    been very well thought out. The second goal statement (statement # 2) is about
    &quot;turning lemons into lemonade.&quot; It recognizes the fact that John single-mindedly
    and selfishly focuses on his own concerns: getting his product line out. And it asks the
    problem-solver to look for ways to turn this situation into an advantageous one. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The first goal statement is more direct. It seeks a way to get rid
    of the results of John&#146;s insensitivity and bull-headedness, without taking up the
    valuable time and efforts of the President and other corporate managers. It also
    recognizes the need to continue to focus on daily production, and - most importantly - it
    recognizes the foolishness and ineffectiveness of proceeding along a path of attempting to
    change John&#146;s personal characteristics. Such characteristics have been indelibly
    inscribed upon John&#146;s personality over many years.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">One key advantage of this flow-chart template is that it (1) puts
    the whole picture in perspective, showing the causes, the effects, and even the systems
    that are in place to eliminate the harmful effect in question. Another advantage is that
    it (2) forms goal statements that recognize all related actions and events, while dealing
    intelligently with each of them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>TRIZ Problem Definition</b>. Most problems worthy of being called
    &quot;problems&quot; have within them at least one major conflict. In the present case
    study, the conflict can be expressed as follows:</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><u>Conflict</u></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">&quot;<i>John channels all resources under his control towards
    meeting his group&#146;s goals, but he does this accompanied by an intimidating style that
    demoralizes and renders ineffective other organizational goals</i>.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">This is a typical conflict: An useful action taken to address a
    worthy goal (IMPROVING FEATURE), causes a deterioration of something else (WORSENING
    FEATURE). When a problem is stated in this fashion - as a conflict between two conflicting
    features or events, the types of solutions that come to mind involve tradeoffs or
    compromises, in which nobody is really satisfied, and which do not really solve the
    problem. For example:</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><u>Ineffective Tradeoff Solution</u></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Give John sensitivity training to make him a little more sensitive,
    while training others in the company on &quot;How to get along with difficult
    people.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">On the other hand if we frame the problem as a &quot;physical
    contradiction,&quot; we take the first step towards a solution that will accept no
    tradeoffs or compromises:</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><u>Physical Contradiction</u></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial">&quot;<i>John has to be &#145;in charge&#146; and not
    &#145;in charge&#146;</i>.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">In other words, John must be in charge of his product line, because
    he needs to make sure that orders get produced and delivered on time. But John must not be
    in charge of his product line, because he views his responsibility as overseeing all other
    activities in the company, and his brash style adversely influences personnel connected
    with these other activities.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Such a formulation of the solution is akin to what is called the
    &quot;Ideal Final Result&quot; in TRIZ. This &quot;IFR&quot; serves as a guidepost that
    must be satisfied by any solution. Furthermore, the TRIZ approach emphasizes solutions
    that &quot;come from inside the system, using system resources,&quot; rather than
    solutions coming from the outside, and thereby making the system more complex, more
    costly, and taking up valuable time (i.e., the solution involving sensitivity and other
    training).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>Solutions from the TRIZ Toolbox. </b>The TRIZ &quot;toolbox&quot;
    is full of solution techniques. It is not the purpose in this brief paper to move
    exhaustively through all of them. Instead, a few of them will be discussed for purposes of
    illustrating the power of TRIZ. Along with each of these will be some actual solutions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><u>Separation in Space</u>. This solution technique asks the
    problem-solver to &quot;separate the conflicting elements in space (i.e., by locating them
    in different places).&quot; This suggests granting responsibility for each of the
    conflicting tasks to different people located in different parts of the organization. John
    should remain in charge of the production aspects of his own product line, but someone
    else (an R&amp;D manager) should be responsible for R&amp;D. In this way, John&#146;s
    efforts are dedicated to what he does best: getting product out. The other individual is
    dedicated to new product R&amp;D. John&#146;s irritable manners may reach this individual,
    but the individual will have enough &quot;tough skin&quot; to shake off John&#146;s
    criticisms, making his/her own decisions about R&amp;D. Note: a good R&amp;D manager will
    listen carefully to people like John, who they should view as one of their several
    internal customers. Similarly, the procurement, marketing and other organizational
    segments will be responsible for their areas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><u>Separation in Time</u>. This solution technique asks the
    problem-solver to &quot;separate the conflicting elements in time (i.e., by assigning them
    to different time periods).&quot; This also suggests granting responsibility for each of
    several sequential (or even concurrent) conflicting tasks to different people located in
    different parts of the organization. John should remain in charge of the production
    aspects of his own product line, but someone else (an R&amp;D manager) should be
    responsible for activities such as R&amp;D, procurement, and marketing, that precede
    product production.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><u>Creative Principles</u>. There are 40 creative principles (also
    called &quot;inventive principles&quot;) that can be applied to the objects and actions
    that make up a given function. The result of such application is a creative solution. For
    example, one of the 40 creative principles is the &quot;Takeout&quot; principle, which
    suggests that the problem-solver &quot;remove all but the one and only important part or
    property from the &#145;object,&#146; leaving in place that part or property in
    place.&quot; This might be interpreted as:</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><u>Takeout Principle</u></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">&quot;<i>Leave John in charge of production.&quot; Take away his
    other responsibilities, assigning them to others</i>.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Yet another creative principle is the &quot;Preliminary
    Anti-Action&quot; principle, which puts in place a mechanism or object that anticipates
    harmful effects, and is ready, in advance, to take care of them, should they arise.&quot;
    This creative principle might be interpreted into the following solution:</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><u>Preliminary Anti-Action Principle</u></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">&quot;<i>The President has a standard reply to any one who comes to
    him, complaining about John: &#145;You&#146;re in charge, and you are responsible for your
    own area. Now how can I help you?&#146; &quot; In fact, the President regularly reminds
    everyone in charge that they, and only they, are in charge, and that they are also
    responsible to each other for the healthy running of ITQ.</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Another creative principle is the &quot;Blessing in Disguise&quot;
    principle, which states that a harmful effect can be turned into an advantage, or into a
    useful effect:</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><u>Blessing in Disguise Principle</u></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">&quot;<i>By placing total responsibility on John for his
    product-line production, and by not having him responsible for areas outside his domain,
    John is able to focus his and his group&#146;s efforts on what he and they do best -
    unbothered by other tasks that are the responsibilities of other managers throughout the
    company</i>.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Another inventive principle is the &quot;Intermediary&quot;
    principle, which suggests placing an &quot;intermediate object&quot; between two
    interacting objects:</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><u>Intermediary Principle</u></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">&quot;<i>Appoint a program manager, responsible to the President,
    for each major product line in the company. John and his group are now supporting this
    program manager.&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><u>The Evolution of Systems</u>. According to the TRIZ approach,
    there is a universal path followed by all systems as they evolve towards
    &quot;ideality.&quot; The steps on this path include various creative solution prompts,
    which when applied, will lead to an improved system. For example, one very
    &quot;high&quot; step is called &quot;Trimming.&quot; Trimming suggests that the
    problem-solver remove an object from the system, and offers various ways that the system
    can be improved by such removal. One way is to ask one or more of the remaining objects
    left in the system to take over the functional responsibilities of the object that has
    been removed. One solution interpretation for the present case study:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">&quot;<i>Remove John from his position, and assign it to another
    product-line manager, or to a projectized manager who is in charge of all aspects. This
    new person does not have the undesirable characteristics that John has</i>.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>Solution Selection</b>. There are several solutions to this
    problem, other than those mentioned above. Not all solutions are as good as others. The
    &quot;best&quot; solution is often some combination of several other solutions.
    Furthermore, there is a very effective TRIZ approach called &quot;ARIZ&quot; which is a
    step-by-step procedure that hones in on the ideal solution, often making that solution
    transparently obvious merely by the problem-definition statement itself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Using well known solution-selection techniques such as &quot;Pugh
    Analysis,&quot; the problem-solver can quickly consider the plusses and minuses of
    individual solutions, relative to some &quot;datum&quot; solution, and recommend the best
    solution, considering all important ITQ requirements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>Summary</b>. The TRIZ approach is a powerful yet creative
    approach for solving problems and for addressing difficult situations in human relations.
    Its strength lies both in (1) its ability to state solution goals, and (2) its ability to
    identify high-level solutions to complex problems. It handles problems involving human
    psychology, interpersonal relationships, and processes in which human beings may or may
    not be participating. Its solutions emphasize system simplicity, reduced cost, and
    reliability - achieved by using the resources available within the system, rather than
    having to go outside of the system seeking answers. The TRIZ approach is also the most
    powerful and creative approach for solving technical problems related to products, product
    lines and manufacturing processes. A little known, but very leveraged use of TRIZ is to
    use it to accurately predict the development of any product or technical system for the
    future, and then to achieve any such developments in just months and years. All of these
    uses of TRIZ have been verified by the Leonardo da Vinci Institute and by the author in
    the world&#146;s most prominent companies.</font></p>
