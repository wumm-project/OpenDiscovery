    <p>Almost half of the venture capital in the U.S.A. is channeled into the life sciences
    and biomedical engineering systems. Dr. Mueller&#146;s firm, BioFutures Inc. (BFI) has a
    complete monopoly over a niche service, that all other biomedical product organizations -
    large or small - need in order to rapidly innovate or field high-level, breakthrough
    products. BFI&#146;s expertise lies in TRIZ - a problem-solving, creative approach that
    resolves even the toughest creative design challenges. BFI forms strategic alliances with
    biomedical and pharmaceutical firms, acting as a catalyst and assisting them in (1)
    problem-solving and (2) rapidly bringing products to the marketplace. BFI is currently
    engaged in applying the TRIZ approach to next-generation drug delivery systems.</p>

    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal</strong> Dr. Mueller, how advanced is the drug delivery industry
    today? </p>
    <p><strong>Mueller</strong> Drug delivery systems are only in the infant stage. There are
    many key problems to be solved, and conflicts to be resolved. The payoffs will be immense
    for a few companies who make the right discoveries and who field the right products.</p>
    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal </strong>Then you attribute success in the drug delivery market to
    luck?</p>
    <p><strong>Mueller </strong>Luck follows the prepared mind. Drug delivery systems follow
    definite steps as they evolve. These steps are known by only a few. BFI has carefully
    organized and elucidated the entire staircase of development for drug delivery systems.</p>
    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal </strong>What do you mean? What is this &quot; staircase of
    development &quot;? </p>
    <p><strong>Mueller </strong>What comes next in the drug delivery marketplace is not only
    &quot;predictable&quot;. It is known with a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, it can
    be developed now - not in the usual five or ten years that must pass before a
    next-generation system emerges.</p>
    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal </strong>Are you implying that today&#146;s major hurdles in drug
    delivery systems are solvable now?</p>
    <p><strong>Mueller</strong> Yes. The forecasting and problem-solving approach called TRIZ
    (Theory of the Solution of Inventive Problems - a Russian acronym) has already been
    successfully applied to dozens of most difficult and complex problems that American
    technology has faced. The problems and system challenges encountered in the drug delivery
    systems are no more difficult than those.</p>
    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal</strong> Could you give us an example of the types of problems
    that TRIZ is capable of solving?</p>
    <p><strong>Mueller</strong> Today it is impossible to introduce certain molecules into and
    through the skin. Other molecules are introduced only at unacceptable rates. There are
    problems with the capacity and adhesion of transdermal patches. Inhalant systems are
    seeking better propelling means, and their overall performance is less reliable than
    desired. Certain measurement and detection systems are too invasive. There is no shortage
    of either problems, or opportunities.</p>
    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal </strong>You said that drug delivery systems were in the
    &quot;infancy&quot; stage of their development. Yet recently there have been some rather
    significant developments. For example, the successful application of ultrasound, as a
    positive influence in molecular transport through tissues, has already been demonstrated.
    Isn&#146;t this really quite sophisticated?</p>
    <p><strong>Mueller</strong> The use of ultrasound is indeed a positive step - and one that
    the TRIZ approach predicts. TRIZ, in fact, goes much further and predicts more precisely
    those specific circumstances under which ultrasound can be far more successful.</p>
    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal </strong>What is the potential for your TRIZ approach in the drug
    delivery business?</p>
    <p><strong>Mueller</strong> The potential for the drug delivery business is huge.
    Ordinarily, the interval between the conception of next-generation drug delivery systems
    is measured in years and even in decades. With TRIZ, next-generation, breakthrough
    products can be conceived monthly. The pace of their appearance is astounding &#150; so
    are the levels of their associated breakthrough.</p>
    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal </strong>Levels?</p>
    <p><strong>Mueller</strong> New products &#150; new technical systems &#150; differ
    according to their importance, their scope and their elegance. Roughly 80 percent of all
    new products are relatively low level inventions. But high level, TRIZ solutions are all
    of a higher level.</p>
    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal </strong>You speak of the &quot;evolution&quot; of drug delivery
    systems. Is this evolution known?</p>
    <p><strong>Mueller</strong> Drug delivery products evolve according to an
    &quot;S-curve&quot;. The main performance indices associated with biomedical devices
    increase over time according to a profile that has the shape of an &quot;S&quot;. The laws
    according to which these products develop and evolve are known. With knowledge of these
    laws, designers, developers and researchers can proceed without interference, without
    experiencing useless trials, and without resorting to that inefficient creative process we
    call &quot;brainstorming&quot;.</p>
    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal </strong>Brainstorming &#150; inefficient? What&#146;s wrong with
    it?</p>
    <p><strong>Mueller </strong>It is highly problematical. It is not useful for complex
    technical challenges. Its acronym is designated as &quot;B.S.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal </strong>But what replaces brainstorming?</p>
    <p><strong>Mueller </strong>Highly accurate known conceptual &quot;prompts&quot;that
    describe the next step in drug delivery systems, and the next step after that.</p>
    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal </strong>But this appears to be incredible.</p>
    <p><strong>Mueller </strong>The TRIZ approach, as used by subject matter experts in the
    drug delivery system industry is truly miraculous.</p>
    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal </strong>What does your firm, BFI, do? Do you work with drug
    delivery firms?</p>
    <p><strong>Mueller </strong>Our strategy, right from the beginning, has been to partner
    with drug delivery firms involved in both long-term and short-term projects. We offer
    value to our prestigious partners through analysis, project definition, project direction
    and system solution. Our role literally permits them to leap-frog the competition.</p>
    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal </strong>But what is the measuring stick for success?</p>
    <p><strong>Mueller </strong>There is one, and that is marketplace response.</p>
    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal </strong>Can you put on your technology forecasting hat and
    predict the major future developments in the drug delivery marketplace?</p>
    <p><strong>Mueller </strong>BFI and its partners already know these developments. There
    will be a move towards the use of electronic, ultrasonic and other types of
    &quot;fields&quot;. Those fields will become far more modulated, structured and
    coordinated. Drug delivery systems will follow the path of miniaturization &#150; all the
    way to micro miniaturization. Non-invasive detection and measurement systems will become
    the rule, rather than the exception. Separate drug delivery system functions will be
    merged into single &quot;super-systems&quot;. Biofeedback will be but one of several paths
    leading to system ideality.</p>
    <p><strong>TRIZ Journal </strong>Thank you, Dr. Mueller.</p>
