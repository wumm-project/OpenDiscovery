<h3 align="center">DISCOVERY</b></h3>
<b>

<p>TRIZ Journal</b> How long have you been involved with the creative approach called
TRIZ? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> It began in 1975. That was a magical year for me. Alone one evening in
the basement of a poorly lit library in Philadelphia, I wandered up and down aisles
stacked with dust-covered books, until at one point I paused and turned to face an English
translation of a Russian-authored book. Pulling it off the shelf, I wiped off the dust and
began browsing through its contents. And there it was, the law of three: &quot;All
technical and psychological functions are composed of three elements.&quot; The author,
Peter Ouspensky, is no longer living. He had been aware of this law during the Bolshevik
revolution in war-torn Russia. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> What were you doing when you became aware of this discovery? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> Directing a government-operated weapons research laboratory and working
on a top secret defense program. I'd recently received a doctorate in engineering, and was
also pursuing a career in medicine. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> Did this new information change your life? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> Yes. I read several other books by the same author, while studying his
&quot;Law of triads&quot; in much more depth. Soon I'd organized my own consulting firm,
the Institute for Defense Technology. In 1984 I moved to California to accept the position
of Director of Engineering at the Aerojet-General Corporation. By 1988 I was teaching
courses on leading-edge design tools at UCLA and at the California Institute of
Technology. </p>

<p align="center"><b>A FALSE START </b></p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> So you knew about TRIZ before the collapse of the iron curtain? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> I had been practicing my own version of TRIZ in the United States for
over 12 years. Then, in 1990 a consultant I knew called about &quot;a new Russian
technique called TRIZ.&quot; I was aware that the technique was not new - that its true
basis went back in time to (at least) the 1920's in Russia. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> And what happened next? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> It was a false start. I was invited to a briefing by a Californian
&quot;TRIZ&quot; company now located elsewhere. The company's Russian technical staff was
technically brilliant and competent, but some of their managers were incompetent, overly
aggressive, and not customer-conscious. No really useful technical information came from
this briefing, and I left with a high degree of frustration. </p>

<p align="center"><b>A REAL START </b></p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> How long did you stay on at Aerojet? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> I left Aerojet-General to found Renaissance Leadership Incorporated
(RLI), and became an instructor for Cal Tech's Executive Management Program. Our company,
RLI, is now the most respected TRIZ corporate consulting and training organization in the
world. As director of the Leonardo da Vinci Institute, an RLI division, I am responsible
for developing TRIZ for use by American corporations. The Leonardo da Vinci Institute also
offers assistance in TRIZ Technology Forecasting, and certifies TRIZ practitioners at
various levels from beginner to master. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> So how did you learn the contemporary version of TRIZ? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> I quickly assimilated the contemporary version of TRIZ and ARIZ (the
algorithm of invention) in five important ways: 

</p><ul>
  <p>(1) Through Althshuller's books; <br>
  (2) by gathering and translating TRIZ information collected by our permanent staff in
  Russia; <br>
  (3) by visiting Russia and spending time with members of the TRIZ community there; <br>
  (4) through my personal friendship with Dr. Valery Tsourikov, CEO of the Invention Machine
  Corporation; and <br>
  (5) by the use of invention software. </p>
</ul>
<b>

<p>TRIZ Journal</b> You are translating Russian books on TRIZ? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> Yes, we have twenty-one Russian TRIZ books, and we are in the midst of
translating them at this time. This activity is a part of the TRIZ Institute. Dr. Ellen
Domb and I just formed a translation consortium, through which member companies can share
in the costs - and in the benefits - of this translation work. As you know, translating
just one single book can be an expensive ordeal. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> What have you been doing for the past seven years? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> I've been teaching TRIZ to executives from America's top companies. I
brief their corporate staffs on an in-company basis. I also present executive overview
courses at Cal Tech; this is how over 100 American companies first heard about the
breakthrough capabilities inherent in the TRIZ approach. </p>

<p>The payoffs realized by some of these American companies are remarkable. Of special
note is how TRIZ caught on at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. After a three-day,
experiential TRIZ class taught by RLI, professional staff members at JPL were coming up
with conceptual solutions to very difficult technical problems. Dr. Julian Blosiu is now
the in-house TRIZ champion at JPL; he is spreading this approach throughout JPL's
technical community. </p>

<h3 align="center">TRIZ MASTERS </h3>
<b>

<p>TRIZ Journal</b> The American Supplier Institute once referred to you as &quot;The
leading American TRIZ practitioner,&quot; and others have called you a &quot;TRIZ
master.&quot; What can you say about the levels of TRIZ capability that practitioners can
achieve? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> Altshuller is certainly a TRIZ master. I know two other TRIZ masters
who are Russian. Personally, it doesn't matter what titles anyone chooses to bestow upon
me. I'm a consultant and a trainer. The bottom line for me is to satisfy my client
corporations and their technical professionals. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> But are you also a TRIZ master? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> A master rarely declares himself - except to his students. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> TRIZ began in Russia - as you pointed out - and many Russians have
been studying TRIZ for decades. Isn't time a factor in determining the level of TRIZ
expertise that a person can achieve? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> I'll answer your question in a TRIZ manner: yes and no. A person can be
&quot;studying&quot; TRIZ all his life, and not achieve a high level. On the other hand,
it does take time to acquire knowledge and experience. Different persons learn at
different rates. </p>

<p>A TRIZ master was a master before he ever began practicing TRIZ. Altshuller had what
was required before he discovered TRIZ. He had the &quot;right stuff.&quot; The same is
true for the other two Russian masters that I know. They have the right stuff! They are
now living in the United States. There may be other TRIZ masters that I am not aware of,
who are living outside of the United States. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> Will you let us know who they are - these other Russian TRIZ
masters who reside in the United States? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> They know who they are. </p>
<b>

<h3 align="center">TRIZ LEVELS OF EXPERTISE </h3>

<p>TRIZ Journal</b> What are the different levels of TRIZ expertise? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> There is a joke that the levels go from &quot;Impostor&quot; to
&quot;Imitator&quot; to &quot;Practitioner&quot; to &quot;Expert&quot; to
&quot;Master.&quot; A TRIZ impostor can be someone who has had TRIZ training, has an
advanced academic degree, is very good at analysis, and has a wonderful grasp of science
and mathematics. Altshuller points out that &quot;Invention is not analysis,&quot; and I
must agree. </p>

<p>More importantly, an impostor is someone who thinks he is far better than he really is.
Some impostors claim that they are TRIZ experts, or even TRIZ masters. Through repetition,
they even begin to believe what they are saying about themselves. They become offensive
and insulting, sometimes resorting to legal intimidation - even against their customers.
They can be identified in two ways: first, they declare themselves openly by making false
claims; secondly, they become known by the poor &quot;results&quot; they produce for their
unsuspecting clients. Already in the United States, some impostors have been unmasked and
revealed by clients who have experienced setbacks from dealing with them. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> What about a TRIZ master? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> A TRIZ master is also a master of humility. He does not get stuck in
the &quot;form&quot; of the TRIZ approach, and he is open to any new ways that work better
than the old ways. This is not always true for a master's followers. TRIZ practitioners
must be on guard to avoid the insidious &quot;psychological inertia&quot; connected with
getting stuck in the form of the TRIZ approach itself. </p>
<b>

<h3 align="center">TRIADS AND S-FIELDS </h3>

<p>TRIZ Journal</b> You mentioned your study of &quot;triads.&quot; How does a triad
differ from a Substance-Field, or S-Field? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> Some TRIZ practitioners have trouble working with S-Fields. Others have
abandoned S-Fields, saying that they have little utility. Still others say that the idea
of S-Fields is an incomplete idea. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> In what way? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> If you recall, Altshuller teaches that a technical function exists only
if it has three elements: for example, a function is &quot;complete&quot; if it is
composed of two &quot;substances&quot; and a &quot;field.&quot; The two substances could
be any objects, visible or invisible, large-scale or small-scale. A skyscraper could be a
substance; so could a molecule, or an automobile, or a steering wheel. The field is said
to provide the interaction between two substances. Typical fields are mechanical fields,
rotational fields, thermal fields, nuclear fields, magnetic fields, chemical fields,
optical fields, sonic fields, etc. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> What is incomplete about this idea? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> Altshuller's observation that three elements are required to create a
function is brilliant, but he does not go far enough. The TRIZ solution-generating
approaches do not tend to use fields to maximum advantage, in arriving at solutions. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> How can this situation be improved? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> The idea behind &quot;triads&quot; is that three &quot;objects&quot;
are required in order for a function to exist. These &quot;objects&quot; are like the
&quot;substances&quot; defined by Altshuller. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> Do you mean that there are no fields? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> Of course there are fields. But the reality is that a field &quot;comes
from&quot; an object. There is an object behind every field. And it is often the case that
two or more &quot;fields&quot; - as Altshuller defines the word - are associated with a
particular function. The main point of a &quot;triad&quot; is that the necessary
requirement for a function to exist is that it is the result of the action of three
objects. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> Can you give an example of a triad? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> Yes, but keep in mind that a triad is a function. Let's take the
situation called &quot;sitting,&quot; which involves a chair and a person. A major
function associated with sitting is the &quot;support&quot; function. It describes a key
interaction between the chair and the person: &quot;Chair Supports Person.&quot; </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> But you said that three objects are required for a function to
exist. You mentioned only two objects: the chair and the person. </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> That's right. A third object is required. Otherwise the chair could not
&quot;support&quot; the person. This is true, even if a person's sitting posture matches
the shape of the chair-seat, and even if the person is very close to the chair seat. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> What is this third object? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> The earth is the third object. The earth is a large, round mass, and
without it, the person and the chair cannot &quot;come together&quot; in a way that
creates the function called &quot;supports.&quot; This function cannot occur in the same
way, outside of the sphere of influence of the earth's gravity. The supports function
could happen on the planet mars, but then the third object in the function would be the
large, round mass called &quot;mars&quot; - of course, there would be some harmful
functions accompanying that situation! </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> Do you have other examples of triads? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> Yes. Every function - everything that happens - serves as an example of
a triad. Consider what happens when an automobile is involved in a collision. There are at
least three major &quot;situations&quot; to be considered. </p>

<p>One situation describes what happens to the car occupant in the collision, without the
benefits of an air bag or seat belt. The function is a harmful one, described by the
statement: &quot;Occupant Strikes Car (interior surface).&quot; The function
&quot;strikes&quot; is made possible by three elements: Occupant, Car, and Impactor. The
impactor significantly decelerates the car, bringing the occupant and the car interior
surface together. This impactor could be a telephone pole, another car, a concrete
embankment, etc. </p>

<p>The second situation describes the interaction, during a collision, between the air bag
and an occupant - without the benefit of a seat belt. The primary function here is a
useful one, described by the statement &quot;Bag Protects Occupant.&quot; The function
&quot;protects&quot; is made possible by three objects: Bag, Occupant, and Air. Air is the
third object. Without it, the occupant and the bag would not come together in the useful
way that offers the occupant protection. </p>

<p>The third situation describes the interaction between the occupant and a seat belt
during a collision. The primary function here is a useful one, described by the statement:
&quot;Belt Retards Occupant (from moving too fast).&quot; The function &quot;Retards&quot;
is made possible by three objects, but in this situation it is not as easy to describe
what all of the objects are. The &quot;operational zone&quot; of the situation must be
considered. One object of the triad is obviously the belt. The second object is a part of
the occupant's body-surface, against which the belt is supposed to transmit a force during
the collision. The third object is the occupant's body as a whole, which has a certain
inertia. Without the occupant's body as a whole, the belt and the surface of the
occupant's body would not come together in a useful way. </p>

<h2 align="center">THE LEONARDO DA VINCI INSTITUTE</h2>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> Where has this advanced work on TRIZ been going on? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> At the Leonardo da Vinci Institute, a division of RLI Incorporated. Our
headquarters is in northern California. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> Could you briefly describe the importance of triads? What else is
going on at the Leonardo da Vinci Institute? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> I'll respond to your first question first. Triads represents a
universal law. All phenomena, all functions, all things that happen, can be described in
terms of three objects. Furthermore, it is a necessary requirement that, for anything to
happen, there has to be three objects coming together to create what happens. </p>

<p>Another way of describing this law is: &quot;Any function can be decomposed into three
objects.&quot; </p>

<p>Triads is important because, as I intimated earlier, this approach makes problems
easier to resolve at the highest levels. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> What else is going on at the Leonardo da Vinci Institute? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> We have a project to explore another idea concerning triads: three
objects forming a triad can come together, sequentially, in six different ways. We are
looking into the implications of this. </p>

<p>We also have a project to look into the &quot;decomposition&quot; of a function from an
entirely different point of view: some functions can be decomposed into
&quot;processes&quot; that have several steps. We believe that the number of steps is
definite, and that this is another universal law. This idea can be quite useful from a
conceptual-design point of view. </p>

<h2 align="center">VISIT TO RUSSIA</h2>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> You mentioned that you had been to Russia. </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> Yes, at one point it seemed like the right time to travel to the source
of TRIZ: the former Soviet Union. I had set the aim to travel to St. Petersburg, where
much TRIZ activity was occurring. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> Did you find conditions in Russia different from the U.S.A.? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> Of course. There are lots of differences. One large difference is
cultural. It is hard to fully understand TRIZ without having some understanding of Russian
culture, economy and politics, all of which are radically different from what American
citizens experience in the U.S.A. On the other hand, people are people, and at its highest
level, human psychology is no different in Russia than it is in the United States. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> What do you remember from your last trip? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> We stayed at a &quot;Communist&quot; hotel. I saw that Russians seemed
to have a &quot;natural&quot; acceptance for systems that fail. Some western observers
have said that, in Russia, organizations simply do not work. Most of the time during our
stay, there was no hot water. For several days there was no water at all. On the level of
services, much of what is expected by citizens of countries in western nations, is
unavailable to the average Russian citizen. </p>

<p>Government &quot;services&quot; provided to the people are inadequate by western
standards. The concept of &quot;free enterprise&quot; is practically non-existent in
Russia. I can't see free enterprise ever happening in Russia on any appreciable scale. </p>

<p>Fortunately I myself do not expect very much in the area of &quot;creature
comforts.&quot; Creature comforts are not what makes life interesting to me. </p>

<p>I asked a Russian friend - who had spent several years in the U.S.A. - for his
observations on the differences between Russia and the United States. I'll never forget
his response. </p>

<p>He said, &quot;I'll answer that question in two ways: one answer for organizations, and
one answer for people. In Russia, organizations just don't work. In the U.S.A., they work
quite well, and they provide citizens with many products and services. But the people
situation is quite different. The Russians have more depth as people. In part, this is
because of their struggles and because of the great adversities they had to live through
on a daily basis. In contrast, Americans appear to be more shallow, with much less depth.
Of course, there are always exceptions.&quot; Russia and the Birth of TRIZ </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> It is from this Russian culture that TRIZ was born. </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> Yes. TRIZ was born in a culture that included many constraints. It was
a culture that did not permit free enterprise and freedom of movement. What can a person
do under such circumstances? One answer is &quot;Create great art, music and
literature&quot; - if and when these forms are allowed. Different periods of Russian
history are noted for masterpieces from the field of literature and from the arts. Russia
is also noted for the persecution of its artists and intellectuals. </p>

<p>&quot;Thinking&quot; is an activity practiced by the great &quot;minds&quot; in Russia.
Thinking is free. It is one of the few occupations that cannot be prevented - either by a
dictatorial government or by another person. It is from the realm of great thinking -
brilliant thinking - that TRIZ was born. Henry Altshuller, the founder of TRIZ, is an
exceptionally brilliant thinker. Curiously, great chess players have also emerged from
this realm of great thinking. </p>

<h2 align="center">CURRENT ACTIVITIES</h2>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> What are your current activities? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> RLI conducts experiential TRIZ classes for technical professionals from
the world's best companies. Our client companies' goal is rapid market capture. They
achieve this by using TRIZ to rapidly conceive and develop next-generation products that
are far better than existing products. These next-generation products offer far more value
to customers. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> What else are you engaged in? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> We're conducting TRIZ Technology Forecasting for major U.S. companies.
These companies want to know precisely &quot;What are our next-generation products, and
how can we get there fast?&quot; </p>

<p>RLI also has a TRIZ certification program, in which we certify TRIZ practitioners at
various levels. Some members of this program are instructors and consultants. </p>

<h2 align="center">TEACHING TRIZ TO YOUNG PEOPLE</h2>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> You mentioned teaching TRIZ to kids. How important is this? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> There's no better way to rapidly teach creativity to young people -
from sixth grade, through junior and senior high school, and all the way through
university levels. National education has to be this nation's biggest priority. The TRIZ
approach raises the creative levels of young people by orders of magnitude. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> How long have you been teaching TRIZ to elementary kids, and to
junior and senior high schoolers? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> It's been over two years now. We're developing course materials and
videos for gifted and talented children, and we're also developing training for gifted and
talented teachers. </p>

<p>These will become available to the public in a few years. I might say that I have been
plagued with calls from parents who want to enroll their children in our program;
unfortunately, we are not set up at this time to accommodate them. Perhaps with the right
kind of financial backing, we can accelerate our TRIZ for young adults projects. </p>

<h2 align="center">STATUS OF TRIZ IN THE UNITED STATES</h2>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> Where is TRIZ in the United States right now? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> The TRIZ approach for designing next-generation products is in its
infancy in the United States. Those few companies who have discovered it, and who are
successfully implementing it with proper and adequate training, have discovered a
goldmine. These companies are guarding one of the best-kept secrets in corporate America:
the seemingly unlimited power of TRIZ for rapidly achieving market success. </p>

<p><b>TRIZ Journal</b> I want to thank you offering to participate in this interview. Do
you have any parting words? </p>

<p><b>Kowalick</b> Working with creativity is working with the miraculous. Creativity is
about becoming an observer of the highest order - working above the level of the ordinary
mind. I am grateful to be a part of this great quest. </p>
