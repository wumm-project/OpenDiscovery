<p><b>ABSTRACT</b></p>

<p>This paper describes TRIZ approaches to solve fundamental contradictions or conflicts.
TRIZ is the Russian acronym that means <i>The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving. </i>Fundamental
contradictions are the most difficult type of problems in the development of next
generation products. TRIZ offers logical knowledge-based technology for solving such
conflicts. New breakthrough concepts that eliminate contradictions can be found routinely
by applying TRIZ technology. Fast breakthrough solving of the fundamental problems of a
new project is the key for its success.</p>

<p><b>1. INtrODUCTION</b></p>

<p>In recent years accelerated product development has become increasingly important. The
marketing life for a product is considerably shorter than ten years ago. It is no longer
acceptable to take years to develop a new generation of a product. The rate of progress in
performance of technological systems has become the key issue in the competition of a
modern economy. </p>

<p>In most cases, my customers knew how to make performance of their products five or even
ten percent better. However, they did not know how to increase the level of performance
significantly. The lack in the search for breakthrough concepts was cased by
ineffectiveness of conventional approaches to define and solve conflicts. A desired
improvement of a product's parameter caused unacceptable deterioration of another
parameter of the product. Therefore, a trade-off was often suggested, instead of a
solution satisfying both of the conflicting parameters. </p>

<p>The Laws of Engineering System Evolution have became a centerpiece in TRIZ thinking
about the strategy of development of new generation products and processes. According to
these Laws, the rate of improvement of a technological system decreases as improvement of
its basic parameters develops a conflict. The only way for a breakthrough is to solve or
eliminate the conflict that has almost stopped the evolution of a technological system. </p>

<p>Dr. Genrich S. Altshuller, the creator of TRIZ, analyzed ways of solving and
eliminating the contradictions in the world's most significant inventions. He identified
inventive principles for solving or eliminating contradictions. Then he developed a
logical knowledge-based method to solve such contradictions. TRIZ conflict-solving methods
include Inventive Principles, the Algorithm for Inventive Problem Solving and TRIZ
Standard Techniques.</p>

<p><b>2. THE TABLE FOR ENGINEERING CONtrADICTION ELIMINATION</b></p>

<p>A situation in problem solving where improving one parameter of a system causes
deterioration of another parameter is called <i>an engineering contradiction</i>. At
first, Altshuller suggested eliminating engineering contradictions by applying the
Inventive Principle. Continued analysis of the most innovative inventions led to an
increase in the number of Inventive Principles, which were included in a set of 40
Inventive Principles:</p>

<p>The Table for Engineering Contradiction Elimination is a matrix having these 39
parameters in two axes. You have to select parameters to improve on the vertical axis and
the parameters that are deteriorated by the improvement on the horizontal axis. The
intersections of the selected parameters contain reference to recommended Inventive
Principles.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a contradiction. When The Boeing Company was developing a
modification of its 737, it was necessary to replace existing engines with more powerful
ones. The more powerful an engine, the more air it needs, and therefore the diameter of
the cowling has to be larger. The distance between the cowling of a more powerful engine
and the ground would be too close. Herein lies the conflict.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="paper1.gif" WIDTH="376" HEIGHT="145"></p>

<p align="center">Fig. 1. The cowlings are to close to the ground</p>

<p>The Table for Engineering Contradiction Elimination described earlier, recommends
several Inventive Principles to solve the conflict, including Asymmetry (No. 4), which
suggests:</p>

<p>A. Change form of the object or its parts from symmetrical to asymmetrical.</p>

<p>B. Increase the degree of asymmetry.</p>

<p>At The Boeing Company, a person who was a member of the team working on the problem
told me that if the team had known the Inventive Principles, they would have solved the
problem faster. They had suggested increasing the diameter of the cowling and flattening
its bottom to make it higher off the ground. </p>

<p>The Table for Engineering Contradiction Elimination is one of the first TRIZ methods.
It is easy to learn how to use the Table, but as any technological system, it has limits.
Accuracy in matching the real parameters that should be improved or get deteriorated with
parameters in the Table is critical in the search for the recommended principles.
Sometimes the list of 39 parameters does not include a parameter that should be improved
or gets deteriorated, for example it does not include the resistance of an electrical
circuit.</p>

<p>Another limit of the table is lies in matching engineering contradictions. As soon as
it is known that engineering contradictions are caused by physical contradictions, it
becomes clear that matching physical contradictions is more effective than matching
engineering contradictions. A physical contradiction is the opposite requirements to the
same parameter of the system. It is possible describe precisely the physical contradiction
to any conflict and eliminate it. To overcome the Table's limits, more effective methods
have been developed.</p>

<p><b>3. THE ALGORITHM FOR INVENTIVE PROBLEM SOLVING</b></p>

<p>The Algorithm for Inventive Problem Solving (ARIZ) is<i> </i>the main TRIZ method to
solve conflicts. It is a method that consists of a set of clear rules based on
understanding the evolution of products and processes, ways to overcome psychological
inertia, and the database of physical contradiction elimination. </p>

<p>The logic of ARIZ guides you to an understanding of the ideal solution to the problem,
which means that the system has to improve itself at no cost and without any undesired
effect. The logic of ARIZ is based on the understanding that any conflict or engineering
contradiction is caused by a physical contradiction where the same parameter has to meet
opposite requirements. ARIZ directs you to define the physical contradiction that prevents
approaching the ideal solution to the problem. ARIZ provides you with a database of
physical contradiction separation learned from 1.5 million of the most innovative
inventions.</p>

<p>ARIZ's basic steps include:</p>

<p>* Analysis of the system, which helps to define the basic function of the system and
the root conflict that is worth solving.</p>

<p>Building the model of the problem including analysis of the two opposite versions of
the selected conflict, selection the version which is the best for the basic function of
the system and building the model of the problem to eliminate the disadvantage in the
selected conflict. </p>

<p>* Analysis of the resources of the system includes analysis of the zone where the
selected conflict happens, periods when it happens and objects and energy that system has.
The purpose of this analysis is to prepare for the separation of the physical
contradiction and utilization of the resources of the system.</p>

<p>* Definition of the physical contradiction includes the definition of the opposite
conflicting requirements to the same parameter, which causes the conflict or the
engineering contradiction.</p>

<p>* Definition of the ideal solution directs one to extreme utilization of the resources.
This step extremely narrows the problem domain.</p>

<p>* Separation of the physical contradiction includes application of one of six rules to
separate conflicting requirements.</p>

<p>* Utilization of the resources directs you to minimize the change in the system and its
cost.</p>

<p>* Evaluation and development of the created concepts.</p>

<p>Lets analyze a situation. A unit of a color laser printer includes a moving
photoconductor carrying droplets of positively charged liquid toner. A positively charged
roller rotates in the reverse direction and removes the excess of the positively charged
toner by electrostatic forces. The forces are in reverse proportion of the square of the
distance between the roller and the droplets. Therefore, the larger the diameter of the
roller, the better it performs its function, but the larger size of the unit. The roller
has a diameter of 20-30 mm which is a trade-off in the selection of its diameter. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="paper2.gif" width="90%"></p>

<p align="center">Fig. 2. Roller </p>

<p align="center">Applying ARIZ to the situation leads to the physical contradiction that
has caused the conflict between the roller's performance and its size. The basic function
of the roller is to remove excess of droplets. Replacement of terms by simple words helps
to overcome psychological inertia. Rename the roller to &quot;remover.&quot; The physical
contradiction is that the remover has to be larger (or even flat) to increase the
electrostatic force of the interaction, and has to be smaller (or bent) to minimize the
size of the unit. The ideal solution is that the remover provides itself with a flat
surface and a bent surface. The two conflicting requirements can be separated between
zones. If the remover has to have a movable surface, it can be a belt. A belt improves the
performance of the remover and reduces its length.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="paper3.gif" WIDTH="409" HEIGHT="240"></p>

<p align="center">Fig. 3. Belt</p>

<p>In traditional engineering thinking, if there is a conflict, it is common to accept a
trade-off. TRIZ thinking leads to analysis of the conflict and to solution satisfying both
conflicting requirements. ARIZ accelerates the search for breakthrough concepts
dramatically. </p>

<p>Elimination of the conflict that almost stopped the evolution of a technological system
provides the possibility for a significant improvement in the system's performance until
the system reaches a new conflict. With TRIZ the next conflict can be predicted and solved
much earlier.</p>

<p><b>4. TRIZ STANDARD TECHNIQUES</b></p>

<p>TRIZ Standard Techniques are the most effective transformations of a product or process
toward breakthrough improvements. To apply these transformations for conflict elimination
successfully, it is necessary, at first, to identify a harmful or unwanted action to be
eliminated. </p>

<p>TRIZ Standard Techniques to eliminate conflicts include:</p>

<p>* Six techniques for direct elimination of a harmful or unwanted action</p>

<p>* Seven techniques for indirect elimination of a harmful or unwanted action</p>

<p>* Three techniques for elimination of the consequences of a harmful action</p>

<p>Three techniques to convert a harmful action into a useful action</p>

<p>These Techniques were designed to simplify the search for breakthrough concepts by
avoiding following steps of ARIZ, while creating the same concepts. These Techniques
suggest ways for elimination of physical contradictions even without their definition.</p>

<p><b>5. CONCLUSION</b></p>

<p>TRIZ is a logical knowledge-based technology for conceptual design in conflict solving.
TRIZ thinking helps overcome psychological inertia and preconceived notions. TRIZ directs
you to select the root conflict. TRIZ helps to maximize utilization of the resources of a
system to make it eliminate the root conflict at no cost and without any unwanted effects.
Engineers, researchers and managers involved in product development can rely on TRIZ to
avoid a failure and trade-off in solving conflicts in development of new generation
products. TRIZ thinking accelerates the search for breakthrough solutions and gives users
the ability to reach far greater level of product performance. TRIZ users have
demonstrated a strategic advantage in new product development.</p>
