<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Traditionally in engineering design one system, or monosystem, is selected for further
development. One system, one problem, one idea. In the paper will be presented the thesis
that if we study simultaneously two systems, or bisystem, instead of a single one, the
result improves. And if we analyse many systems, or polysystem, instead of bisystem, the
result will be yet better. </p>

<p>&quot;Traditional&quot; TRIZ, too, has usually worked according to the line &quot;one
system - one problem - one idea&quot;. But inside TRIZ has been developed some important
new concepts already related to the polysystem: the trend mono-bi-poly (Altshuller),
alternative system (Gerasimov and Litvin) and feature transfer (Gerasimov and Litvin). A
contradiction appears: some tools have polysystem approach, many others continue to
consider the monosystem. </p>

<p>The contradiction can be easily resolved, when the core concepts of TRIZ are looked
from the polysystem point of view. The presentation of TRIZ in terms of polysystem and
feature transfer permits to connect concepts and tools in a more simple, straightforward,
and logical way than formerly. Despite the growth of the theory and methodology, the
innovative technology of design can be studied and used more easily and effectively than
ever before. </p>

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>The first sources of inspiration have been Finnish engineers who have taken part in
different seminars and courses in 1985-1997. Valuable meetings with Vladimir Gerasimov in
1996 and in the beginning of 1997 have helped me to clarify many concepts and ideas. Of
course I carry the whole responsibility of any drawbacks in the paper. </p>

<h3>Some necessary definitions</h3>
<i>

<p>System:</i> The common definition is that the system is a set of parts that is more
than the sum of these parts. We'll add the requirement that the system should resolve
contradictions in the parts. Further, the system can be the set of all sorts of objects.
It can be machinery, a process, a set of features, a combination of problems, ideas,
marketing measures, and so on. </p>

<p><i>Bisystem.</i> System evolved from two objects. An important case is the bisystem
evolved from an original system and an alternative one. </p>

<p><i>Polysystem.</i> System evolved from many objects. </p>

<p><i>Competing system.</i> The system having the same function as an original system. </p>

<p><i>Original system.</i> The system we want to improve. </p>

<p><i>Alternative system.</i> The system which have pluses and minuses
&quot;opposite&quot; to the properties of original system, coupled as follows: In the
original system feature A improves, and feature B worsens, in the alternative system
feature A worsens and feature B improves. The definition means that both systems in the
pair are alternative to each other. </p>

<h3>Polysystem of problems</h3>

<p>I would like in the beginning to demonstrate the new concept and the new approach by
one case. The bicycle is a very good example. All typical features and problems of design
and the development of technology can be seen in the bicycle. Let's list some actual
problems in the most common, upright bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>No weather protection </li>
  <li>Limited speed </li>
  <li>Limited amount of luggage </li>
  <li>Not very safe in collisions </li>
  <li>High aerodynamic resistance or drag </li>
  <li>Etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>The important and new feature in the list is that we try to collect all possible
problems. Usually one or few bottleneck problems are selected. However, strange as it
sounds, a set of problems can be solved more easily than a single
&quot;mono-problem&quot;. </p>

<h3>Polysystem of competing designs</h3>

<p>The next step is to list most important systems competing with the common bike. The
common bike is an original. The function of the bike is &quot;to move a person and
luggage&quot;. The competing systems are all systems having the same function. Examples of
competing systems: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Conventional, upright bicycle (original system) </li>
  <li>Recumbent. A word recumbent refers to the seated position. The cyclist sits in the seat
    a little bit like in the car. </li>
  <li>Hybrids: human powered, electrically assisted bikes </li>
  <li>Electric scooter (&quot;electric bicycle&quot;) </li>
  <li>Car </li>
  <li>Trice </li>
  <li>Wheelchairs </li>
  <li>Spacecraft </li>
  <li>Flying carpet </li>
  <li>Etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>The list has five important features: 

</p><ol>
  <li>Systems have the same function </li>
  <li>List contains existing technologies or ideas </li>
  <li>List should contain all existing ideas </li>
  <li>Function is only limitation </li>
  <li>List already gives clues </li>
</ol>

<p>First, we collect systems in the limits of function, not in the limits of the branch of
industry. Functional approach helps to think out of the box. It also helps to activate
existing knowledge. </p>

<p>Second, we list only existing technologies and ideas. We don't try to guess new
solutions. Facts should be collected before creating new concepts. </p>

<p>Third, all existing designs should be listed. No one shouldn't be forgotten. Training
experience shows that sometimes people hide a solution they think as good and then try to
&quot;fit&quot; the methodology to the old idea. All old things should be pronounced,
written down and listed. </p>

<p>Fourth, the function is the only limitation. Systems can be exotic (spacecraft),
fantastic (flying carpet), or even crazy (perpetuum mobile). We are not selecting any of
competing systems. We are interested in features. A crazy idea can contain some useful
feature. Perpetuum mobile is not possible, but a very low-energy bicycle is. </p>

<p>Fifth, the list already speaks to the user. He/she can see immediately some new unusual
problems and ideas. From any list of old systems or ideas we can always get new
combinations. However, combinations should not be random sets of things, but pairs of
alternative systems. </p>

<h3>Pairs of alternative systems</h3>

<p>From the list of competing systems we can select different pairs of alternative
systems. Let's look at some examples of pairs and properties. Only a few of possible
combinations and only some of important features are named. </p>

<p><i>Upright bicycle VS. recumbent bicycle. </i>Properties of an upright bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: maneuverability, old and feasible technology </li>
  <li>Minus: high aerodynamic resistance or drag </li>
</ul>

<p>Properties of a recumbent bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: low aerodynamic resistance or drag </li>
  <li>Minus: less maneuverable than an upright </li>
</ul>
<i>

<p>&quot;Open&quot; bicycle VS. faired bicycle</i><br>
Properties of an open bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: light </li>
  <li>Minus: no weather protection </li>
</ul>

<p>Properties of a faired bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: weather protection </li>
  <li>Minus: heavy </li>
</ul>
<i>

<p>Bicycle powered by a cyclist only, VS. electrically assisted bicycle</i><br>
Properties of an human powered bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: light </li>
  <li>Minus: little power </li>
</ul>

<p>Properties of an electrically assisted bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: powerful machine </li>
  <li>Minus: heavy </li>
</ul>
<i>

<p>Bicycle VS. Car</i><br>
Properties of an bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: high energy efficiency </li>
  <li>Minus: low speed and low carrying capacity </li>
</ul>

<p>Properties of a car: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: high speed and high carrying capacity </li>
  <li>Minus: low energy efficiency </li>
</ul>
<i>

<p>Bike VS. Tricycle</i><br>
Properties of an upright bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: maneuverability </li>
  <li>Minus: low carrying capacity </li>
</ul>

<p>Properties of a three-wheel bike of tricycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: more luggage </li>
  <li>Minus: less maneuverable than a two-wheel bike </li>
</ul>

<p>Pairwise comparison of competing systems, with opposite pluses and minuses, allows one
to get quickly interesting and non-trivial problem statements. </p>

<h3>The ideal final result and feature transfer</h3>

<p>We describe ideal final result first simply picking up the pluses: </p>

<p><i>The ideal bicycle. </i><br>
Properties of an upright bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: maneuverability, old and feasible technology </li>
</ul>

<p>Properties of a recumbent: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: low aerodynamic resistance or drag </li>
</ul>
<i>

<p>The ideal bicycle</i><br>
Properties of an upright bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: light </li>
</ul>

<p>Properties of a faired bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: weather protection </li>
</ul>
<i>

<p>The ideal bicycle</i><br>
Properties of an human powered bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: light </li>
</ul>

<p>Properties of an electrically assisted bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: efficiency </li>
</ul>
<i>

<p>The ideal bicycle</i> Properties of an bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: high energy efficiency </li>
</ul>

<p>Properties of a car: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: high speed and high carrying capacity </li>
</ul>
<i>

<p>The ideal bicycle</i><br>
Properties of an upright bicycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: maneuverability </li>
</ul>

<p>Properties of a three-wheel bike of tricycle: 

</p><ul>
  <li>Plus: more luggage </li>
</ul>

<p>We will combine the pairs of systems so that a good feature is transferred from the one
system to another. For the combination many different TRIZ tools are used. </p>

<p>For example: we want to combine good features of the human powered bicycle and
electrically assisted one. Let's try to formulate the physical contradiction. A bicycle
should be LIGHT, for easy riding, and a bicycle should be HEAVY, for... For what? When do
we need a heavy bike? Obviously when we want use the bike for fitness purposes. The ideal
final result: The bike should be heavy enough for exercise, and light enough for avoiding
too big loads harmful for the cyclist. An electrical motor helps to maintain an optimal
load, depending, for example, on heart rate. The essential point is to coordinate the
&quot;rhythms&quot; of the machine and the cyclist. We can refer also to the principle:
&quot;Turn lemons into lemonade&quot;. If we have heavy batteries, why not to get some
benefit from them? When pedalling is too light, extra weight helps. </p>

<p>The first pair in the list is an upright bike and recumbent bike. One physical
contradiction: The bike should be low, to decrease resistance, and the bike should be
high, to be visible on the road. One suggestion is to use the copying principle: to add
for example a flag, which is visible but doesn't cause aerodynamic resistance. </p>

<p>Or the last contradiction: two wheels - three wheels. Maybe use the dynamization trend?
If all three wheels will draw and steer, we can get the maneuverability of a two-wheel
bike in the three-wheel bike. </p>

<p>There is no strict rule saying, how to find the proper physical contradiction, trend or
principle. And there should not be; the model should give clues, work as a map and a
compass. It should show the direction and general &quot;landscape&quot;, and at the same
time leave enough room for imagination. </p>

<p>The presentation of two systems with their opposite pluses and minuses can be called
the &quot;<b>two pluses</b>&quot; formula. One can also make a table, called the &quot;<b>two
pluses</b>&quot; matrix. The formula or matrix is simple, nearly childish, but it works!
The user can quickly get some new viewpoints and ideas. He/she gets fast success, which is
so important, especially in the beginning, when learning new skills. At the same time the
formula prepares the problem for more exact analysis, for example by ARIZ. </p>

<h3>Polysystem of solutions</h3>

<p>We see that there are many systems, many features, many contradictions and many ideal
final results. Actually we have always had the polysystem of problems and solutions. We
consider the model of two systems and two features because the human problem solver cannot
see much more at once. It's easier, and takes less time to make many simple models than a
single complex one. </p>

<p>So the future bike will be the combination of many features from existing technologies
and designs: 

</p><ul>
  <li>maneuverable as an upright bicycle </li>
  <li>convenient and energy-efficient as a recumbent </li>
  <li>powerful as an electrical bicycle </li>
  <li>stabile as an three-wheel bicycle </li>
  <li>etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>Not only the engineering system, but the design process, too, is a polysystem. The
process is combined from many steps of improvement starting from the first concepts.
Instead of &quot;one step design&quot; we need &quot;many step design&quot;. The concept
should be criticized and improved, criticized and improved, many times. </p>

<h3>Smashing psychological barriers</h3>

<p>The early mountain bike of Charlie Kelly and Gary Fisher was an ugly duckling. The
inventors, of course, saw the bright future. Mountain bike WILL give: 

</p><ul>
  <li>possibility of off-road riding </li>
  <li>easy balance </li>
  <li>certain stopping power </li>
  <li>low gears </li>
  <li>few jolts </li>
</ul>

<p>Distinguished bike manufacturers practiced negative thinking. They saw many problems: 

</p><ul>
  <li>weight: too heavy </li>
  <li>fat frame </li>
  <li>fat and heavy tires </li>
  <li>heavy hub brakes </li>
  <li>off-road riding: who in the hell does want ride on mountains and in forests? </li>
</ul>

<p>The suspicions were strong. The new concept turned the philosophy of bike design on its
head: 

</p><ul>
  <li>beefed-up frame instead of slender one </li>
  <li>low gears instead of high ones </li>
  <li>fat tires instead of lean ones </li>
  <li>heavy-duty brakes instead of nice, small and sophisticated brakes </li>
</ul>

<p>Both sides were right their own way: the ugly duckling became a success, but only after
numerous improvements: 

</p><ul>
  <li>less weight </li>
  <li>better brakes </li>
  <li>better tires </li>
  <li>better gears </li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Think positively&quot;, we are taught. Actually we should think BOTH positively
AND negatively, properly combine both thinking modes. So we need the bisystem of positive
and negative thinking. By the way, there is a polysystem, too. De Bono suggests not two,
but six thinking modes (thinking hats). </p>

<p>Bisystem, two pluses matrix, ideal final result and other models help to switch on, and
switch off, negative and positive thinking, when needed. Models help to weaken the
psychological barrier. The barrier is very strong. In everyday life we need a
psychological defence mechanism. We need to think positively, at least of ourselves and of
our own ideas. But just this defence mechanism disturbs, when we should improve the ideas.
To improve the idea is necessary first to find drawbacks, but positive thinking requires:
don't seek drawbacks. </p>

<p>That's why is necessary temporarily &quot;switch on&quot; negative thinking. My friend
and colleague Vladimir Gerasimov conducted 1995-1996 some consultation projects for a U.S.
company. One commercially very successful project was carried out in less than 3 months.
During these three months the conceptualization cycle was repeated about 40 (forty) times.
</p>

<h3>&quot;But yet we are doing this all the time!&quot;</h3>

<p>The most important objection to the polysystem, many step approach is: &quot;Here is
nothing new. This is trivial. We are designing complex systems all the time.&quot; OK.
Let's consider successes and failures in the history of technology to see, whether
Polysystem are trivial. Here are two points. </p>

<p><b>First</b>, the polysystem is the system which solves contradictions, not every
device or machinery containing many parts. </p>

<p>Famous successes in the history of a bicycle are, for example, a safety bicycle,
introduced in 1884-1890, and a mountain bike, which appeared in 1970s. Famous failures in
the bicycle design are, for example, Ikera in 1982 and Sinclair큦 C5 in 1985. </p>

<p>The safety bicycle is the most common bike we are riding now. In the beginning it was
called Safety, because of the low machine with a chain drive to the back wheel was safer
than the high bicycle with a big wheel. The safety bicycle combined beautifully already
existing technologies. The most important were the following two: 

</p><ol>
  <li>Chain transmission, which was already widely used in bicycles. The invention was to
    place chain transmission just from the pedals to the back wheel. </li>
  <li>Pneumatic tires, which were invented already in 1845 and used on heavy horse-drawn
    vehicles. The invention of Dunlop in 1888 actually wasn't the air tire itself, but the
    idea to use it in the bicycle. </li>
</ol>

<p>No totally new components, and no totally new designs of PARTS were used in the safety
bicycle. The idea was in the system as whole. The NEW, superior system was build from OLD
sub-systems. </p>

<p>The mountain bike evolved as the combination of old and even bad sub-systems: beefed-up
frame, low gears, fat tires, heavy-duty breaks. These components were not very good in
city bikes, but worked well in mountain bicycles. A GOOD system was combined from BAD
sub-systems. Of course old components were gradually improved. The BREAKTHROUGH was
combined from many INCREMENTAL sub-steps. </p>

<p>Let's now consider failures. In 1982 was introduced the bicycle Itera, made from
plastic. Itera with plastic frame, forks, wheels and handlebars was light and strong and
would not rust. But it didn't sell. </p>

<p>In 1985 Sir Clive Sinclair tried to introduce a recumbent bicycle with an electric
motor, called C5. The bike was environmentally friendly and cost-effective. In spite of
many good features C5 became first laughing stock in London and then a commercial failure.
</p>

<p>What is difference between success and failure? Successful engineering systems are
developed according to the &quot;contradiction formula&quot;: old and new, bad and good,
incremental improvements and a revolutionary breakthrough, etc. Unfortunate systems have a
linear formula: new components - new quality, only incremental changes, or only one single
breakthrough. Itera was based on one idea: use of plastic in a bicycle. New material - new
quality. No contradictions. Actually the material became more important than customer
needs. Sinclair큦 C5 was an attempt to make a breakthrough in one step, without necessary
cycles of design. The mountain bike is here a good comparison. Frame, tires, breaks, gears
all were improved after the first concept. </p>

<p>A fresh success story in vehicle design is the Sojourner rover of NASA, landed in Mars
in July 4,1997. It is no surprise that here, too, we can easily see the contradiction
which was solved. Newsweek described the rover as follows: &quot;More Than the Sum of Its
Parts. Sojourner was fitted with many items that there purchased off the shelf...&quot;
(Newsweek, July 21, 1997, p. 45). There were standard power converters, modems, cameras
and motors. This like solutions enabled the superior performance at low cost: 171 million
dollars compared to the 3 billion budget (in today's dollars) of Viking in 1976. At last,
the work was done in short time. As whole: better, cheaper, faster. </p>

<p>Questions: Which is more trivial, typical and common in industry, successful
&quot;polysystem design&quot;, or average trade-off? Do we really have nothing to learn
from designs like safety bicycle and NASA`s Mars rover? </p>

<p>It is important, too, to pay attention to the <b>second</b> point: time. Some good
polysystems have evolved in the history without conscious &quot;polysystem design&quot;.
But they are too rare and the &quot;wild&quot; evolution takes too much time. Radial tires
are now taken for granted in cars and many people don't know, or have forgotten, that in
past there were cross-ply tires. However, the breakthrough of radial tires took 55 years,
from year 1914 to 1970s. Can we really afford such time losses inevitable in the work by
trial and error? </p>

<h3>From past to future</h3>

<p>History is interesting when it is connected with future. Let's consider yet two
&quot;real&quot; problems, that is problems not yet solved: air bags and urban planning. </p>

<p>Very clear example is the air bag problem, considered earlier in TRIZ Journal, see
papers: 

</p><ul>
  <li>J. Kowalick. &quot;No-compromise&quot; design solutions to the air bag fatalities
    problem, TRIZ Journal, April 1997 </li>
  <li>E. Domb. Contradictions: Air Bag Applications, TRIZ Journal, July 1997 </li>
</ul>

<p>Let's imagine that the air bag problem itself is solved. We have an airbag which
protects an average adult best possible way and never causes injuries or fatalities to
small persons. We'll have all advantages of the airbag, without any drawbacks. Can we be
satisfied with this like solution? Obviously, not, because of there is, for example, a
psychological problem. Kowalick refers to the study conducted by The Nation Center for
Policy Analysis in the U.S. Some conclusions of the study: drivers tend to be more
aggressive in vehicles equipped with air bags, and this aggressiveness offsets any safety
gains. The best air bags and other technical improvements in the car cannot help much, if
drivers continue to &quot;compensate&quot; improvements by increased speed and more
hazardous driving habits. </p>

<p>We get a new contradiction: some drivers want to drive at high speed and hazardously,
and they should drive slowly and carefully. To solve the contradiction, we can use
separation in place and time, and taking out principle. One possible solution: to
encourage automobile sport, to draw hazardous driving from public roads to more safe
places. </p>

<p>There are &quot;pure&quot; engineering problems, too. One problem is that a steering
column and pedals are not necessarily the best possible &quot;interface&quot;.
Mercedes-Benz, for instance, is studying the car controlled by joysticks. Removing the
steering column removes one of safety problems, too. </p>

<p>I am nearly sure, that the air bag problem will not be solved until a set of problems
in the &quot;environment&quot; of the bag will get their solution, too. </p>

<p>Another example: urban planning. I would like to plan the city of future. We know well
many problems of a modern city: congestion, slow traffic, air pollution, noise, accidents,
aggressive people. We know old solutions well, too: overpasses, multilevel highways,
parking facilities, traffic control, smaller cars, public transport. Of course there are
plans of totally new cities, but it is difficult to reconstruct a whole city. Maybe try to
find contradictions and solve them? To get the ideal city using in first order old
&quot;sub-systems&quot;: common materials, technologies, plans and designs? Say,
multiplying overpasses and multilevel streets, roads and highways. By &quot;addition&quot;
of old constructions we can get a totally new quality: a two-level or multilevel city. </p>

<h3>Getting customer oriented quality</h3>

<p>World class quality requires that the product meets the needs of the customer. But how
to find needs? When the safety bicycle was introduced in 1880s, people considered it ugly.
But soon they fell love with it, and to our days most bicycles have been
&quot;safeties&quot;. The need existed beneath surface. </p>

<p>When Itera bicycle was introduced in 1980s, people again said how ugly it was. But this
time they didn't begin to buy. Although market research had convinced that it should be
more than 100 000 buyers in Sweden alone. </p>

<p>The verbatims of potential buyers cannot alone forecast customer demands. Customers
often cannot know exactly what they'll need in future. Polysystem approach help to see
hidden, non-spoken needs. </p>

<h3>Boosting of TRIZ</h3>

<p>Many key concepts of TRIZ can be more easily understood and used, if we present them in
terms of the bisystem and polysystem. The new presentation will complete old definitions
and make them more exact. It will not cancel them. </p>

<p><i>Engineering contradiction</i> is the contradiction in a bisystem. If we have an
engineering contradiction, we always have an alternative system, too. And we have
alternative engineering contradiction. </p>

<p><i>Physical contradiction.</i> If we have the physical contradiction, we have a
bisystem. Alternative systems have opposite physical properties. </p>

<p><i>Ideal Final Result.</i> Ideal final result is a polysystem of features got as the
result of successive combination of alternative systems. </p>

<p><i>ARIZ.</i> The two pluses formula contains in a hidden form the key concepts of ARIZ.
The formula helps to learn and use ARIZ. </p>

<h3>Polysystem approach and computer aided innovation</h3>

<p>Computer aided innovation (CAI) is a new concept developed as a result of progress in
innovative software. When I speak of software I mean products of Invention Machine
Corporation which I know, although I have heard there are other TRIZ based SW packages,
too. More exactly, I큞l consider TechOptimizer Professional Edition. </p>

<p>Software Package TechOptimizer Professional Edition contains five modules:
TechOptimizer, Effects, Principles, Prediction and Feature Transfer. The TechOptimizer
module analyzes components, functions and links in the system and proposes ways to
simplify the system. This module produces problem statements. The Effects module provides
the user with access to more than 520 scientific effects. The Principles module solves
engineering contradictions by introducing innovative principles (Altshuller큦 matrix).
The Prediction module helps define the future direction of innovation. The Feature
Transfer module allows to transfer desirable features from one engineering system to
another. More detailed information you can get from the web site of Invention Machine
Corporation <a HREF="http://www.invention-machine.com">http://www.invention-machine.com</a>
</p>

<p>The Feature Transfer module in TechOptimizer is a direct example of the polysystem
approach... If you want to improve an object, you find a number of objects that perform
the same function. Then you analyze these objects, investigate the best features of each
one and try to transfer these features to one object.&quot; (TechOptimizer, manual, p.
150) </p>

<p>In the function model and trimming stages a single engineering system is analyzed. One
can say we have monosystem approach here. If we want to analyze the bicycle, we should
select one of competing systems: common bike, recumbent, electrically assisted bike,
faired bike, or some else. Feature transfer and trimming are complementary, and,
obviously, give the best result when used together. </p>

<p>Prediction, Principles and Effects modules permit in short time finding many structural
solutions or predictions, many principles and many effects. The software allows one to
develop a polysystem of ideas. So the polysystem approach and TechOptimizer support each
other. </p>

<p>At last, TechOptimizer as whole is a good polysystem, much more than the sum of five
modules. </p>

<p>There is an interesting similarity between the polysystem approach and the IM modules
Prediction, Principles and Effects. We have lists of competing systems and bisystems
(pairs of alternative systems). IM contains lists of predictions, principles, functions
and effects. It seems that people prefer lists and very simple tables or matrixes to long
algorithms. </p>

<h3>Trend mono-bi-poly</h3>

<p>TechOptimizer gives in the Prediction module four examples of the trend <i>mono-bi-poly:</i>
evolution of pencil, propeller, stitching head and light source. They are good examples of
hard systems. I would like to widen the definition of the trend, and add &quot;soft&quot;
systems, in first order following lines of evolution: 

</p><ul>
  <li>one problem, two problems, many problems </li>
  <li>one idea, two ideas, many ideas </li>
  <li>one step, two steps, many steps </li>
</ul>
