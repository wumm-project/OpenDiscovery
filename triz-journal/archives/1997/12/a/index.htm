<p>The American Supplier Institute presented the Third Annual International
Total Product Development Symposium November 5-6, 1997, in Dearborn, MI, USA.
The symposium brings together practitioners of the Taguchi methods, Quality
Function Deployment, and TRIZ, to learn more about each of those disciplines and
to work on methods of integrating the tools and methods into an overall process
of improving product and process development.</p>
<p>The TRIZ case studies were much more detailed than those in past conferences,
and will begin to satisfy the demand for modern case studies from a wide variety
of fields that arises when people begin to study TRIZ.<font size="2"> </font>The
TRIZ<font size="2"> </font>Journal will reprint several of these articles in the
coming months. For those who would like complete copies of the papers quickly,
the proceedings of the Symposium are available for purchase from The American
Supplier Institute, asi@amsupp.com.</p>
<p>One overall theme emerged from the case study and theoretical presentations:
the practice of TRIZ is in rapid development. Some organizations use a
combination of analytic tools of TRIZ with the TRIZ databases of solutions to
create large numbers of potential solutions to recalcitrant technical problems.
Others use much more extensive analytical methods, to generate a small number of
highly targeted solutions. This review will cover corporate case studies and
consultant presentations.</p>

<p align="CENTER">Corporate Case Studies</font><b></p>
<p>Ford Motor Company</b> was featured in 3 outstanding papers. Colin Young, B.J.
Saltsman, and Mike Lynch presented 2 cases
</p><ul>
  <li>The use of TRIZ/SIT to design a method for consistent side air bag
    deployment.</li>
  <li>The use of TRIZ to eliminate windshield/backlight molding squeak and
    flutter (buzz.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases the TRIZ/SIT internal consulting group worked with the subject
matter experts from Ford and from its Full Service Suppliers to get full details
of existing methods of design and production, and conducts benchmarking studies
and patent research to establish the current state of the art. They then applied
the analytic methods of SIT to refine the definition of the precise problem to
be solved, and use the contradiction resolution methods of TRIZ to generate
solutions. Both the Invention Machine and Ideation software were used at various
stages of the solution generation.</p>
<p>Results were as follows:
</p><ul>
  <li>For the side airbag deployment, one new category of solution was created,
    and 23 specific solution concepts were generated, to add to the 3 categories
    and 8 concepts that had existed previously. Several concepts have been
    simulated in detail and the most promising are in prototype development.</li>
  <li>For the windshield problem, 2 new categories of solution and 15 solution
    concepts were created, to add to the 6 categories and 17 concepts that had
    existed before, but had not solved the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, the authors have explained the development of some of the
concepts in great detail, and illustrate the importance of extensive technical
knowledge of the physical mechanisms causing the problem to generating useful
solutions. The combination of the SIT and TRIZ techniques helped them focus
their solution concept generation on areas with high probability of success.
There was some audience discussion of whether some of the tools of ARIZ are
similar to the SIT method.</p>
<p>Eugene Rivin and Victor Fey of The TRIZ Group presented an update and more
detailed review of the use of TRIZ to eliminate rough idling in a compact car
based on the case study presented by Larry Smith of Ford at the 1996 symposium.
This case provides a dramatic demonstration of the differences between
traditional systems engineering approaches to the problem and the TRIZ approach.
</p><ul>
  <i>
  <li>Traditional approach:</i> Use a heavy weight as a damper and begin
  research projects to reduce the demand on the idling engine by all other
  subsystems. These projects would not be completed by the time the car was out
  of production.</li>
  <i>
  <li>TRIZ approach: </i>Use ARIZ steps to exactly identify the conflict, then
  use existing resources to resolve the conflict. In this case, the airbag
  system was used a damper instead of the added lead weight. It was so effective
  that the vibration was reduced to 20% of the original situation, and was 30%
  of that of the previous best in class car.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;The <b>Eli Lilly Company</b> demonstrated the use of TRIZ to solve 2
major problems in pharmaceutical production, and also discussed their method for
deploying TRIZ training throughout their global research centers in a paper
presented by Wes Anderson and Justin Farrell of Eli Lilly and Karen Tate of The
Griffin Tate Group. Forty problems were solicited by the TRIZ coaches, and 5
were selected for solution during a week-long Global Technology conference.
Solutions were presented for two of these:
</p><ol>
  <li>A freeze-dried drug forms a solid plug which dissolves too slowly when
    reconstituted. Thirty-three new ideas for solutions were generated, and
    action plans were developed for five of them.</li>
  <li>Insulin is grown by tailored bacteria. The cell walls must be broken to
    release the insulin in the production process. Existing ways of breaking the
    cell walls are unreliable. Sixty ideas were generated, of which two were
    selected for action. Lab tests on the two methods are in work now.</li>
</ol>
<p>The presenters emphasized the need for a mix of subject matter experts from
production and research with TRIZ application coaches in a team environment.</p>
<p>Michael Slocum of <b>ITT-Cannon </b>presented the case of improvement of a
feedthrough (gland) for a nuclear reactor vessel that used the Invention Machine
TechOptimizer™ to organize extensive use of the value analysis and trimming
tools of TRIZ, among others, to achieve a 63% cost reduction, 42% component
reduction, 100% harmful effect reduction, and dynamic system response
improvement by 12dB. The case is reprinted in this issue of The TRIZ Journal.</p>

<p align="CENTER">Consultant Presentations: Advancing TRIZ Theory and Case
Presentations</b></font></p>
<p>James Kowalick and Ellen Domb of <b>The TRIZ Institute </b>presented 2 papers
that used the airbag deployment problem (familiar to regular readers of The TRIZ
Journal—see the June and July issues for several articles ) to illustrate TRIZ
techniques of technology forecasting, S-field analysis, and the new technique of
Polysystem TRIZ, also called &quot;Plus-Plus&quot; analysis, presented by Kalevi
Rantanen in the August and October issues of the TRIZ Journal. Polysystem
analysis of the gas generator system for 9 possible gas sources with respect to
10 system requirements gave a detailed and very precise definition of the
problem, which contained within the definition the keys to a solution using
segmentation of the airbag and the gas generator system.</p>
<p>John Terninko of <b>Responsible Management </b>presented &quot;An application
of directed product evolution&quot; derived from a study written by Alla Zusman,
Boris Zlotin, and Gafur Zainiev of Ideation, Inc. Directed evolution is a system
of postulates that are applied to the TRIZ technological forecasting tools to
constrain the future system to those that are most probable from a technical
perspective and to those that are most acceptable from a market success
perspective. The directed evolution method was illustrated using a case study of
an endoscopic medical instrument to fasten together cut ends of intestine,
showing the evolution from suturing to stapling to continuous attachment using
liquid media (polymers) and the various means of polymerization that could be
used in the body.</p>
<p>Eugene Rivin of <b>The TRIZ Group and Wayne State University</b> presented a
case study &quot;Accessory Drive for Internal Combustion Engines&quot; that was
developed in part as a capstone design project in the engineering curriculum at
Wayne State University. He shows how the analysis of the conflict between the
limitations of the capability of available technology of both flat (poly-V)
belts and V- belts with adjustable width pulleys caused the analysts to select
the TRIZ evolution pattern &quot;Transition to a Higher-Level System&quot;
(combining two systems into a super-system) as the solution to the problem. An
elegant combination system in which the flat belt drives most of the accessories
while the V-belt provides the variable transmission ratios was patented and is
under development.</p>
<p>Gregory Yezersky of the <b>Systemology Research Group </b>showed examples in
metallurgy, space shuttle design, and plastics production to demonstrate the use
of his systemology method of grouping the TRIZ tools into systems of tools. The
ultimate goal of the process is to convert a problem to a standard problem, so
that the standard solutions of TRIZ can be applied. Systemology uses a decision
tree to direct the flow of problem solving choices toward the clarification of
correct set of methods for each class of problems.</p>

<p align="CENTER">Conclusion</p>
</b></font>
<p>The Total Product Development Symposium builds on the great success of the
American Supplier Institute’s Taguchi Methods Symposium series, in which major
advances in the theory of Taguchi methods are presented (such as introduction of
the Mahalanobis distance method and the dynamic Taguchi methods) and then a
family of case studies is presented in the next several years to illustrate the
range of applications of the theory to a wide variety of cases.</p>
<p>In 1995, almost all the TRIZ presentations were basic tutorials on the
methods of TRIZ. In 1996, almost all the TRIZ presentations were again
tutorials, although some were illustrated with case studies (Ellen Domb’s
study of software applications of the 40 Principles, James Kowalick’s
presentation on technology evolution, and John Terninko’s presentation on the
use of existing resources in conflict resolution.) In 1997, many case studies
were presented that illustrate the sophistication of the applications of TRIZ in
a variety of industries, and major theoretical advances were proposed. We will
await the future meetings to see which of these advanced theories are used in
case studies to solve significant technical and business problems.</p>
