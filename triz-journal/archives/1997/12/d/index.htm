<p>Introduction</font></b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Classification of engineering solutions by an inventive level
is a handy tool and gives many practical benefits. Further, the classification
is the basis of scientific methodology for innovative design. The five levels
and their applications are described. The use of classification is illustrated
by the example of an airbag.</p>

<p>The Five Levels</font></p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Five levels of solutions were first introduced by G. S.
Altshuller. The levels have been then considered in many publications (Altshuller
1984, pp. 16-26; Altshuller 1986, pp. 44-49; Altshuller 1987, pp. 22-29;
Altshuller et al. 1989, pp. 14-17; Ivanov 1987, pp. 22-25; Petrovich-Tsurikov
1986, pp.70-72; Rantanen 1985, pp. 28-30; Salamatov 1990, pp. 82-88, Savransky
1996).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We can describe the five levels as follows:</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">1 The Standard Solution</b>. Typical trade-off, quantitative
changes without new quality. Choosing between a few obvious variants. Knowledge
within one profession is used. Altshuller studied patents from 14 different
classes, published 1965-1969, and found that 32 % of patented solutions
represent the first level (Altshuller 1987, pp. 22-29).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Examples: Thick (but not too thick) insulation to decrease
heat losses. More heavy trucks to improve cost-efficiency of transport. Better
resolution of display (say, 800x600 instead of 640x480).</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">2 Change of a System</b>.<b> </b>The object is changed
qualitatively, but not substantially. Choosing between tens of possible
variants. Knowledge within one industry is used. About 45 per cent of patented
solutions are at Level 2.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Examples: A fire extinguisher added to a welding device. The
hollow handle of an ax (giving less weight and a more optimal center of
gravity). A map turned upside down (comfortable when you are driving from North
to South).</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">3 Solution Across Industries</b>.<b> </b>The object is
radically changed. Choosing between hundreds of possible variants. Knowledge
outside the specific industry is used. About 19 % of solutions are in this
category.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Examples: Radial tire. Ball point pen. Mountain bike. Mouse
in a computer. Model-T Ford.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">4 Solution Across Sciences</b>.<b> </b>The new object is
created. Choosing between thousands or tens of thousands of possible variants.
New scientific knowledge, rather than technological information, is used. About
4 % of solutions are at Level 4.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Examples: Use of memory metal in a coupling. Internal
combustion engine. Integrated circuit. Personal computer. Pneumatic tire.
Virtual reality. Mining metals by using bacteria. Pilkington process in glass
manufacturing. Use of electrohydraulic effect.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">5 Discovery</b>.<b> </b>Solution based on a scientific
discovery. Choosing between hundreds of thousands or millions of possible
variants. New discoveries are made first and then applied. About 0.3 % of
solutions are Level 5.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Examples: Aeroplane. Transistor. Computer. Photography.
Penicillin. Bicycle. Memory metals. Polymers. Steam engine and thermodynamics.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Table shows the level of invention, the character of change,
the number of variants, the character of knowledge and the distribution of
inventions by level:</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Table</b>: The levels of inventions</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The evaluation of solutions by level is, obviously,
subjective to some extent. For example, some people think that the integrated
circuit is the most important invention in the 20th century, that is, more
important than a transistor. However, when a great number of solutions are
classified, a small group of best inventions can be separated rather
unanimously. All agree that the transistor and the integrated circuit both are
very high level inventions. Subjectiveness is not a big problem. There are ways
to get consensus - for example Delphi technique. The only condition is that all
evaluators should know the classification criteria of TRIZ.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The criteria of inventiveness are, in addition, changing in
time. The idea to use memory metal in couplings was an invention on the fourth
level in the beginning of 1960s. Today the idea to introduce memory metals,
which already are rather well-known, into some new branch may be an invention on
the third level.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">One open question is: does the distribution of inventions by
level change with time? Altshuller studied in 1982 patents (published in the
former USSR), from three patent classes. The criteria were the same as in the
study of patents from years 1965-1969. The results: first level - 39 %, second
level - 55 %, and third level - 6 %. Inventions of fourth and fifth level
weren´t found at all (Altshuller 1986, pp. 51-52). The change, perhaps, can be
explained by the statistical variation between samples. Or maybe the
distribution really changes. More research is needed to answer to this question.</p>
<b><font size="5">
<p>The Use of the Classification</p>
</font>
<p>Evaluation of solutions</b>. Classify solutions, products and ideas by an
inventive level.</p>
<b>
<p>Improving products</b>. Knowing the current state of products and designs we
can build more conscious strategy for product improvement. There are usually
much designs on the first level. Often they are profitable today, but cannot
maintain the competitiveness in long run. Maybe we should to increase the share
of second, third and fourth level innovations?</p>
<b>
<p>Implementation of TRIZ</b>. TRIZ and tools of TRIZ are based on the selection
and study of high level inventions. The evaluation and classification of
solutions make it easier to learn and use innovative technology of design. You
will understand where the trends, principles, effects and predictions come from,
and how to use them most effectively. Different tools work on different
problems. Principles produce second level solutions easily. To get solutions of
third and fourth level we need effects and inventive standards or predictions,
too.</p>
<b>
<p>Improving core competence</b>. Don´t improve only products. Improve the
capability to develop better products. It is interesting to locate the levels of
well-known design technologies. Narrow professional knowledge and CAD mainly
help to find optimal quantitative parameters. That is, they produce first level
solutions. So, TRIZ and Computer Aided Innovation, CAI, is really needed for
generating solutions of high levels.</p>
<b>
<p>Knowledge management</b>. The classification helps to detect innovative ideas
in the first beginning and select valuable information. We know that high level
innovations use scientific effects outside the field where they are developed. A
new type of ship´s propeller, invented by analyzing a fish´s tail, may be more
interesting than small improvements in a traditional screw propeller.</p>
<p><font size="5"><b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Airbag as an Example</b></font></p>
<p>Backround information of airbag problems in cars you can find in the papers
of Kowalick (&quot;No-compromise&quot; Design..., http://www.triz-journal.com)
and Domb (Contradictions: Airbag..., http://www.triz-journal.com) (See The TRIZ
Journal Archive for these articles, which originally appeared in April and July,
1997). The problems and ideas concerning an airbag, and the supersystem
&quot;around&quot; the bag, can be beautifully described by the five levels:</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">1 The Standard Solution</b>. Quantitative features of an
airbag are sought. The deployment threshold (the speed of the car that is
required for the airbag to fire) is made lower or higher. The inflation speed of
the bag is made lower or higher. The result has been an unbearable trade-off
between lives saved by airbags, and fatalities caused by the airbag itself. So
called smart airbag with different sensors and a computer is - at best - the
compromise between device complexity and safety. The supersystem: speed limits.
Limiting the use of private cars. - A supersystem is a system that includes the
engineering system as one of its components.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">2 Change of a System</b>. The airbag is changed
qualitatively. For example, segmentation of an airbag, or local quality. There
are ideas to use multiple crushable layers, which cushion the blow from the bag
itself, but don´t prevent the original purpose (to protect from striking the
vehicle interior). See &quot;E. Domb. Contradictions: Airbag Applications&quot;
(http://www.triz-journal.com). In the supersystem: improved, more safe dashboard
and steering wheel.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">3 Solution Across Industries</b>. Use of materials and
technologies from other industries. For example ferromagnetic and electric
fluids. &quot;Mechatronic&quot; airbag. Components of the supersystem:
principally new safety belts, seats, the improved body of a car, etc.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">4 Solution Across Sciences</b>. Use of new, &quot;smart&quot;
materials in airbags. The supersystem: The whole transport system is changed so
that collisions are excluded, without limiting individual transport.<b> </b>Warning
system for preventing collisions. Navigation systems for safer routes.</p>
<b>
<p align="JUSTIFY">5 Discovery</b>. ??? An airbag based on nanotechnology? Maybe
someone discovers or invents a smart substance that itself (without sensors,
computers and actuators) detects the occupant and properly regulates itself. The
supersystem: New physical principles of transport? Totally automatized,
maximally individual transport??</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The classification helps to state the problem correctly.
Discussion of airbags seems to be concentrated on to the problems and ideas of
first and second level. But it is possible that the problem cannot be solved on
lowest levels. We should consider the solutions on the third and fourth level,
too. Further, propably there are not only one single solution, but the complex
of solutions on different levels. So, look at many levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font size="5">
<p>So Simple, So Genial</p>
</font></b>
<p>Think: classification by level is very common procedure. In schools, in
universities, in sport, in music etc. the performance and results are evaluated
by level. There are criteria for quality awards. Hotels and restaurants are
ranked: from one to five stars. Mushrooms get stars by gastronomic value. And so
on.</p>
<p>Altshuller transferred the idea of ranking, old and trivial on many other
fields, into the world of inventions, ideas and innovations. It was the
beginning of TRIZ and, later, Computer Aided Innovation.</p>
