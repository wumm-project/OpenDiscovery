<p align="CENTER">Introduction</b></font></p>
<p>The SAE Topical Technical Conferences focus on specific issues, and bring
together diverse experts in the field with people active in implementation of
the methods being discussed. TRIZ was included in this meeting on virtual
manufacturing and knowledge-based design because TRIZ’s history of development
from the knowledge base of the world-wide patent collection, and because TRIZ is
unique in its capability to accelerate the conceptual design and problem
resolution process. The other tools presented either
</p><ul>
  <li>Automate existing processes (the expert system process presented generates
    1.36 million solutions, which then have to be sorted to find the 4 that are
    practical!) or</li>
  <li>Enhance existing proceses through early human interaction. Many of the
    virtual reality tools make it easier for people to see environments in 3
    dimensions (such as a workcell, or a car interior) for problem
    identification before the commitment to the design is made.</li>
</ul>
<p>This review will cover only those papers that had direct or possible
relationships to the use of TRIZ, with the editor’s observations on those
relationships.</p>

<p>George Hrydziuszko is Director of the <b>EDS Detroit Virtual Reality Center</b>.
He presented an overview, &quot;The Virtual Revolution in Design and
Manufacturing&quot; that predicted that extensive, integrated tools of virtual
reality (VR) in the next decade will change design, manufacturing, and assembly
radically. VR is now being used for visualization of design—in the future it
will be used for production as techniques now used for rapid prototyping become
the manufacturing tools for &quot;mass customization.&quot;</p>
<p>He noted 3 barriers to the implementation of the family of virtual reality
tools::
</p><ol>
  <li><i>Cultural</i>: The comfort of the use of paper design, physical
    prototypes. Traditions of specific decision making authority based on
    models. The cultural impact of making mega-dollar decisions through the use
    of &quot;toys.&quot;</li>
  <li><i>Organizational structure and antiquated methodologies</i>. Tools are
    enablers. Organizations can be enablers or roadblocks. Improvements tend to
    start in remote corners of the organization, protected from the roadblocks
    of the existing organizational infrastructure. Until the improvements are
    used organization-wide, only a small fraction of the benefits will be
    realized.</li>
  <li><i>Perception of cost:</i> There is always a cost of change, and benefits
    may not be immediate. Long-term rewards of change are priceless. Cost
    analysis frequently does not includes such issues as</li>
</ol>
</p><ul>
  <li>What is now being done that could stop being done with VR technology?
    (Physical prototypes, rework, redesign, etc.)</li>
  <li>What are the losses due to product introduction delay?</li>
  <li>Competitive advantage to early adopters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Accounting for these factors will overcome any objections to the cost of VR
systems.</p>
<p>Bernie Nadel of<b> IntelliGineering Corp</b>., presented an excellent
tutorial on knowledge-based engineering. He started with the history of expert
systems. Since expert systems are computer programs that reason like the experts
the benefit is the merged value of consulting with many experts. For creative
situations, there is no deterministic algorithm, so the methods used combine
knowledge with inference. This results in gigantic searches, and amplifies the
trial-and-error opportunities many-fold. His example of a constraint
satisfaction model for the design of a transmission using an expert system was
an excellent teaching tool for demonstrating the method. Possible combined use
of artificial intelligence techniques with virtual reality were discussed, and
possible combined use with TRIZ became obvious—TRIZ analysis and concept
development could limit the number of trial-and-error pathways that are explored
by the artificial intelligence system, and make the results much more focused.</p>
<p>Sylvia Karmanoff of <b>General Motors Truck Group</b> presented &quot;Workcell
Visualization.&quot; She described a system that uses 3-D modeling of people,
machine, and parts to simulate manufacturing assembly. The technique lets
engineers detect problems before designs are finalized, and is an important step
in simultaneous engineering. Involvement of suppliers in simulation of the final
process has started.</p>
<p>William Regli of <b>Drexel University</b> presented &quot;Internet Computing
for Agent-Based Engineering.&quot; Networked suites of tools for design,
acquisition, test, production and maintenance will be available to engineers,
buyers, testers, manufacturers and marketing professionals. &quot;Agents&quot;
are appearing for many applications. Three examples were presented
</p><ol>
  <li>Partner and subcontractor selection</li>
  <li>Design-for-manufacture</li>
  <li>Design knowledge-bases and repositories</li>
</ol>
<p>TRIZ-related tools, such as searches for scientific effects that enable
breakthrough solutions are in the third category of the tools that Dr. Regli
described. ( Invention Machine’s Phenomenon™ is an example of this kind of
enhancement of a basic TRIZ tool by adding Internet search capabilities with
intelligent guidance of the search to find means of accomplishing desired
functions.) The research now underway with academic-industry-government
collaboration is to develop very fast means of identifying appropriate search
objects by many characteristics so that the searches return a limited number of
very useful results.</p>
<p>Shuh-Yuan Liou of the <b>Ford Motor Company </b>presented the Ford <i>Design
Advisor</i> system, that is a principal tool for the Ford 2000 integrated
system. The Voice of the Customer and the Voice of the Manufacturing Process are
integrated with the detailed CAD-CAM systems and specialty engineering databases
(injection molding, stamping, forging, etc.) Tools identified as &quot;Design
Evaluation Reports&quot; and &quot;Tooling Feasibility Analysis&quot; are
probable points of entry for TRIZ, since these<i> Design Advisors</i> alert the
designer to conflict situations. He presented case studies for a variety of
parts and subsystems that demonstrated the potential for 10-15% tooling cost
reduction and 15-25% redesign time reduction and improvement of first pass
success.</p>
<p>Likewise, Doug Fish of <b>Tecnotatix Technologies </b>showed a proprietary
software implementation of a virtual manufacturing tool set. The feasibility
analysis step is the injection point for TRIZ application to parts design. This
system deals only with parts and subsystems, so there does not appear to be an
opportunity for system-level breakthrough design.</p>
<p>Fascinating papers were presented by many other speakers, showing the
integration of robotic software with VR data to simulate the behavior of robots
in the the assembly process, the integration of human performance with VR for
ergonomic design, the use of VR for training and development, and the use of VR
in conjunction with the World Wide Web, and the technical issues of managing
proprietary data on detailed designs when using VR for esthetic feedback. The
repeated theme, used by <u><i>all</i></u> speakers was that VR &quot;catches
problems sooner&quot; thereby saving money.</p>
<p>Ellen Domb tied all these sophisticated tools back to the<font size="2"> </font>product
and process development method with her tutorial on TRIZ. The conclusion was
that VR may help you find problems, but TRIZ provides the means to develop
innovative concepts that remove the problems, and that prevent future problems.
The audience provided TRIZ demographic information—in a sophisticated
engineering audience that uses many of the most powerful CAE tools and that also
develops new tools, only 12% had heard of TRIZ (or TIPS, or SIT) and only 3% had
any experience with TRIZ.</p>
