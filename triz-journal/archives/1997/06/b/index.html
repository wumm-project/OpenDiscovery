Book Reviews and Commentary by Ellen Domb<br>

<p>In the 7 months since we started the TRIZ Journal, the single most frequently asked
question from new readers has been &quot;What can I read in English to help me learn
more?&quot; and until now, my response has been limited to referring them to the
collection of papers by co-editor James Kowalick and the research report from GOAL/QPC
co-authored by Karen Tate, Bob King, and Ellen Domb (see Products and Services. ) Since
the editors of this journal are authors of these publications, it looked a bit
self-serving! </p>

<p>I'm delighted to report on 2 new books, both available now, that will help introduce
the English-speaking world to the concepts of TRIZ. They are: </p>

<p>Victor Fey and Eugene Rivin: <b><i>The Science of Innovation: A Managerial Overview of
the TRIZ Methodology. </i></b>$27. plus shipping from The TRIZ Group, 30120 Northgate

Solutions to Innovative Problems.</i></b>  $20 plus shipping.. Responsible Management, 62

</a></p>

<p>These 2 books have different purposes and are written from different points of view.
This review will try to help the reader pick the best book for the readers' purposes, but
my personal recommendation to a new TRIZ student would be to read both of these along with
the earlier publications, then to attend an introductory TRIZ class, then to read the
translation of G. Altshuller's book <b><i>Creativity as an Exact Science.</i></b> Lev
Shulyak's translation of Altshuller's <b><i>And Suddenly the Inventor Appeared</i></b> is
easy to read, and will introduce the reader to many of the classical teaching problems of
TRIZ, but does not deal with the overall theory of TRIZ. It is a good supplement to any of
the other books. (See Products and Services.) </p>

<p>Victor Fey and Eugene Rivin's <b><i>The Science of Innovation: A Managerial Overview of
the TRIZ Methodology</i></b> is the first of a series of eight planned books on TRIZ,
under the title <b><i>The Technology of Innovative Engineering Series.</i></b> This short
overview (82 pages) stands on its own as an introduction to TRIZ. It is not intended to
teach the reader how to practice the tools and techniques of TRIZ, but to introduce those
concepts in enough detail that the reader will know when to go to which concept for help
with a particular problem or situation. The book is also motivational--the examples are
very clear, and demonstrate why and how the TRIZ method is different from other
&quot;creativity&quot; methods, to motivate readers to pursue further study of TRIZ. </p>

<p>The book is organized to be read straight through. The introduction and first chapter
are an executive overview of the book, explaining the structure of TRIZ and its basic
concepts. But even in this overview, they give very practical guidelines on how to apply
the TRIZ concepts. Fey and Rivin's explanation of how to define mini-and maxi-problems is
the clearest I have seen; they take it from being a rather advanced concept in ARIZ to
being an easy-to-use way of setting the constraints on a practical problem. This may be
especially useful for members of product improvement teams who need to make quick
decisions on whether they will modify an existing product or create an entirely new one. </p>

<p>Subsequent chapters address Su-field analysis, standard solutions, laws of
technological system evolution, ARIZ, and the knowledge base of scientific effects.
Appendices have detailed examples of application of four of the 40 principles innovation,
and excerpts from the scientific effects database. </p>

<p>The explanation of the Su-field method is typical. It is very brief, but clear, and
achieves its apparent objective: the reader will understand when Su-field modeling will
enhance the understanding of a problem, and will then (presumably) go to the forthcoming
book on the subject, or to a seminar to lean how to use the method. </p>

<p>The illustrations and examples deserve separate comment. They are well-chosen to
enhance the explanations of the TRIZ concepts. The illustrations have been simplified
considerably from those used in training classes, and make a considerable contribution to
the clarity of the examples and to the book overall. </p>

<p>These excellent examples are also the book's one weakness, which could be remedied in
future editions. Virtually all the examples are mechanical, and could lead the TRIZ
beginner to conclude that TRIZ is a system for innovative solutions to mechanical
problems. Adding a few &quot;high technology&quot; electrical, electronic, or
telecommunications examples, or some bio-technology or medical examples would expand the
audience, and would avoid creating the wrong impression with readers who are new to TRIZ. </p>

<p>Victor Fey, who worked with Altshuller for many years, and Eugene Rivin, who is a
professor or mechanical engineering at Wayne State University, both have extensive
consulting and training experience and have drawn on a mix of classical TRIZ examples and
their own applied experience to create this work. </p>

<p>Congratulations to them on a book that will help spread the knowledge of TRIZ
throughout the English-speaking engineering community! </p>

<p>John Terninko, Alla Zusman, and Boris Zlotin: <b><i>Step-by-step TRIZ: Creative
Solutions to Innovative Problems</i></b> is a textbook that follows the conceptual
framework of Terninko's successful <b><i>Step-by-step QFD</i></b>. It can be read by an
individual as an introduction to TRIZ or used as a class reference and workbook in a
workshop-style seminar. I have used <b><i>Step-by-step QFD</i></b> in my classes for the
last year, and I'm glad that he took the best features of the progressive workbook format
for this book. </p>

<p>John Terninko is one of the founders of the Quality Function Deployment Institute, and
has been teaching QFD and the Taguchi method of Robust Design world-wide for the last two
decades. He has now been studying TRIZ with Alla Zusaman and Boris Zlotin (long-time
colleagues of Altshuller's, and co-authors of several of Altshuller's books), and has been
teaching and consulting in TRIZ for the last 2 years. They have taken on the challenge of
integrating the methods of classical TRIZ with the new TRIZ tools developed by Zlotin and
Zusman, and helping the product improvement/product development world understand how to
merge the TRIZ tools with QFD and Robust Design. </p>

<p>This review of <b><i>Step-by-step TRIZ</i></b> is based on an advance draft which has
been used for training, but the final version will be available by the time this review
appears in print. This is a 212 page combination of education, training, history,
philosophy, and reference material that any TRIZ student or TRIZ practitioner will want to
have. </p>

<p>The history section helps the non-participant understand how and when Altshuller and
his colleagues made many of their conceptual and analytic breakthroughs. The
&quot;legends&quot; repeated in many of the training classes have been organized here into
a short, coherent history of the massive work. </p>

<p>The classical tools of TRIZ (defined as those developed before 1985) are presented
well, and the 40 principles and the contradiction matrix are reproduced in an appendix.
The examples throughout the book combine the traditional (the metal beads wearing out the
elbow of the pipe, the acid etching the container rather than the samples that were to be
tested) with a unique example: Terninko presents his own case, complete with x-rays and
photographs, of the problem of removing a screw that was inserted in his leg to help a
bone heal, and now cannot be removed because the screw driver slot was destroyed and the
bone grew over the screw. He also uses some gentle humor in showing how technically
feasible solutions (dissolve the bone around the screw, explode the screw, etc.) may not
be practical, because either he or his doctors don't want to take the risk of pioneering
the new solution! He then guides the reader through the exercises in using each of the
TRIZ concepts. When the book is used as a class textbook, these exercises become the
workshop part of the class. </p>

<p>The Innovative Situation Questionnaire, the Problem Formulator, and Anticipatory
Failure Analysis are three of the TRIZ tools developed by Zlotin and Zusman. Until now
they have only been available at seminars and through the Ideation software. The authors
present them in an easy-to-use style, illustrating the first two with the case of
improving bicycle performance (product development) and the case of removing the screw
from Terninko's leg (problem solving). The methods can be used by themselves, to define
the problem to be solved, or they can be used in conjunction with ARIZ on very complex
problems. </p>

<p>The Anticipatory Failure Analysis tool (originally called &quot;subornation&quot;)
could be a powerful partner with FMEA (failure modes and effects analysis) since it uses
the TRIZ principle of &quot;reverse&quot;-find out what <i>could</i> cause the problem,
the examine the problem situation to see if any of those circumstances could be there,
then remove the possibility. The case study of contamination of metal tubes for use in
aircraft longerons has been published in conference proceedings, but this is the first
time it is available to the general TRIZ audience. </p>

<p>No matter which version of TRIZ the reader has studied, these will be valuable tools
for problem analysis. </p>

<p>Reviewers have the privilege of recognizing the author's hard work, and then suggesting
more. The chapter on Su-field analysis refers several times to the 76 standard solutions,
but only gives examples of a few of them. An appendix or a table with all of them would be
very helpful. <b><i>Step-by-step-TRIZ</i></b> has a very good section on the meaning of
the symbols of Su-field analysis, and could serve as a reference for people who are
reading technical papers that use Su-field diagrams. </p>

<p>One area for improvement is the section on patterns of design evolution. It takes the
reader through one of the eight patterns, and discusses, but does not demonstrate, hybrid
patterns of evolution. On the other hand, the organization of principles introduced in
earlier chapters so that the reader can see how they are used to move a design toward an
ideal final result, is very helpful-beginners will see the underlying structure of TRIZ
very clearly. </p>

<p>Some of the diagrams that illustrate the various case studies are done in fairly coarse
gray tones, as 3-dimensional representations of complex systems. and many of them are
unlabeled, other that with a general description of the problem. Simplifying and labeling
the diagrams would make the examples more accessible to people who are not familiar with
the particular machine or system being used in the example. </p>

<p>John Terninko, Alla Zusman, and Boris Zlotin's <b><i>Step-by-step TRIZ</i></b> combines
classical TRIZ with new tools in a format that makes it possible for people to learn one
skill at a time, then combine that skill with the next, and build a product development
and problem solving family of skills. This will be an extremely valuable resource for
those who ask &quot;what can I read in English?&quot; </p>
