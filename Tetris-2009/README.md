# Sources of the TETRIS Project

The TETRIS project (2008-2009) was funded by the European Commission —
Leonardo da Vinci Programme.

OpenDiscovery discovered a CD with a TRIZ handbook in several languages
(English, German, French, Italian, Latvian) and five Flash animations.  The
handbooks (containing the cover, a how-to, the text and five tasks) are
compiled in a single (per language) document.  The Flash animations are
provided "as is" in the _showcase_ directory since Flash is no more in use for
several years.

From the envelope of the CD: The material can be freely distributed and copied
under the condition to quote the project, the authors (see the introductory
part of the handbook) and the contribution of the European Commission.

## TETRIS - TEaching TRiz at School

From the EU website 
<https://www.up2europe.eu/european/projects/tetris-teaching-triz-at-school_119943.html>

Innovation is the main pillar of Europe future and it is the main objective of
EU policies. Innovation requires, to be effective, trained researchers and
designers with enhanced creativity, problem setting and problem solving
skills. These skills are nowadays taught in short courses 2 or 3 days long
(too short to overcome psychological inertia) and are not taught at school.

The TETRIS project will therefore develop:
- a multimedia training material to attract people to the subject of the
  project, give them the basics of creativity and help them to overcome
  psychological inertia,
- a prototype of train the trainer course for the teaching of creativity,
  problem setting and problem solving,
- handbooks as reference to be given to teachers and students,
- a report on introducing TRIZ at schools.

TETRIS will be designed accordingly to the needs of the business world (a
specific research will be carried on this topic).

TETRIS is devoted both to students and to young researchers. The methodology
and techniques taught by TETRIS will be adapted from the TRIZ methodology. The
TETRIS project however won’t just train the teachers of a basic TRIZ course,
it will develop a course that will overcome psychological inertia and will
boost creativity, problem setting and problem solving capacities. Therefore
those that will have attended the TETRIS course will be more creative, will
have an enhanced capacity in understanding situations and problems, and will
find innovative solutions more easily. Moreover they will be able to learn and
internalize more easily and quickly more advanced techniques and tools to
enforce these skills because psychological inertia will have been already
overcome.  Testing courses will be made both in companies and schools. The
feedback from this testing will be used to improve the prototype of the train
the teachers course and of the training materials. Meetings are foreseen to
persuade decision makers, stakeholders and potential user to adopt the TETRIS
methodology.
