Text: Towards a methodology of discovery
Text: In his article from 1960, Altshuller distinguishes two essentially different types of discovery:

DiscoveryType: (DT1) Detecting new phenomena

DiscoverySubType: (DT1.1) Discoveries that require an explanation
Purpose: Help to discover new phenomena
Example: The discovery of X-Rays by Röntgen

DiscoverySubType: (DT1.2) Discoveries that don’t require an explanation (establishment of new facts)
Example: Discovery of new plants or animals
Example: discovery of new deposits in geology
Example: new observations in astronomy etc. etc.

DiscoveryType: (DT2) Establishing regularities by explaining phenomena that are already known
Purpose: Help to discover new regularities

Recommendations for (DT1.1) 

Recommendation: Pay attention to phenomena that are already known but different in a strange way
Recommendation: Pay attention to blind spots within already known phenomena
Recommendation: Pay attention to blind spots outside the known phenomena
Recommendation: Evaluate known phenomena from a new point of view
Recommendation: Discovery of new phenomena by combining the old
SubRecommendation: (The simplest version) A is known, B is known, C is detected as the relationship between A and B
SubRecommendation: (More complex version) A + B -> C, and C + D -> E 
Recommendation: (The inverse) A ist studied with the assumption that it results from a combination of two previously unknown phenomena B + C
Recommendation: (Analogies) Two groups of phenomena A and B are similar. Phenomenon a1 from group A might correspond to the still unknown phenomenon b1 in group B.
Recommendation: Call self-evident and universally recognised phenomena into question
Recommendation: Elimination of a non-universal phenomenon
Recommendation: Find phenomena that contradict each other

Recommendations for (DT1.2)

If [Rule: (the law/regularity is to be established for the first time)] then 
[Recommendation: Increase the number of known facts until the law manifests itself.] endif.

If [Rule: (the law/regularity is to be established by overcoming the difficulties that the previous theory came across)] then
[Recommendation: Introduce hypothetical phenomena that remove difficulties.
SubRecommendation: What unknown phenomena or facts must be taken as reliable to remove the difficulties of the theory?
SubRecommendation: Often the most difficult is to recognise the leakiness of the old theory and the need for new assumptions
Recommendation: Don’t concentrate only on a theories application to new domains, but also on the study of its weak spots
SubRecommendation: Develop the theory not where it is strong, but where its weakness is felt
SubRecommendation: Look for cases in which the theory is inapplicable
SubRecommendation: Look for cracks in the theory
SubRecommendation: Study not laws, study exceptions
Recommendation: Transfer of methods and apparatus from one region to another
SubRecommendation: (Special case) Dissemination of methods and apparatus to a wider area
SubSubRecommendation: (Special case) a well-known phenomenon that was considered limited is now seen as a universal law
SubSubRecommendation: (The reverse) a new regularity is established by limiting the principle that was previously considered to be universal
Recommendation: Return to old theories on a new basis] endif.
